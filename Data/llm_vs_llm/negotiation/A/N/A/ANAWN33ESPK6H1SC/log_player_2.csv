"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,000,000
2. Alice's current offer is $950,000
3. I know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation
4. I have 10 rounds to negotiate
5. John's offer of $1,000,000 is my backup option

Since:
- I have many rounds left for negotiation
- There's a significant gap between Alice's cost ($800,000) and her offer ($950,000)
- The current offer is only slightly better than John's backup offer

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I can likely get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Let me think about a strategic counteroffer:

1. Alice's cost is $800,000
2. Her initial offer was $950,000
3. My maximum is $1,000,000
4. I want to start with a reasonably low but not insulting offer

I'll offer $850,000, which:
- Gives Alice a $50,000 profit (6.25% margin)
- Is significantly lower than her initial offer but not unreasonable
- Leaves room for negotiation
- Is much better than John's price of $1,000,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has moved down from $950,000 to $900,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. This represents a $100,000 savings compared to John's offer
3. Alice's cost is $800,000, so she's still making a $100,000 profit
4. We still have 7 rounds left
5. The negotiation is moving in the right direction

Since:
- Alice has shown significant movement in price ($50,000 reduction)
- We still have several rounds left
- There might still be room for a better price
- The gap between her cost ($800,000) and current offer ($900,000) is still substantial

I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer. The movement in price suggests we might be able to reach an even better deal.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Let me make a strategic counteroffer:

1. Alice has moved from $950,000 to $900,000
2. My previous offer of $850,000 was rejected
3. Alice's cost is $800,000
4. We need to show some movement to keep negotiations productive

I'll offer $875,000, which:
- Splits the difference between my last offer ($850,000) and her current offer ($900,000)
- Gives Alice a $75,000 profit (9.4% margin)
- Shows I'm willing to move up from my previous position
- Is still $125,000 better than John's price
- Leaves some room for further negotiation if needed

{""product_price"": 875000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze this latest offer:

1. Alice has moved down again, now to $887,500
2. The movement is getting smaller ($12,500 reduction from last offer)
3. We're seeing convergence between our positions:
   - My last offer: $875,000
   - Her current offer: $887,500
   - The gap is now only $12,500
4. This is $112,500 better than John's price
5. Alice would make $87,500 profit, which is reasonable
6. We're halfway through our rounds, and the negotiation pattern suggests this might be close to Alice's best offer

Given:
- The small gap between our last positions
- The slowing rate of price reduction
- The reasonable profit margin for Alice
- The significant savings compared to John's price
- The risk of losing momentum if we continue

I think this is a good deal and it's time to accept.
