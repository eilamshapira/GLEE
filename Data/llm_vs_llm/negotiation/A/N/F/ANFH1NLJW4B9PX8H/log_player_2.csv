"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: The offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000. I would actually lose money if I accepted this offer. Additionally, it's much higher than John's fixed price of $800,000. While I could make a counteroffer, I still have the option to buy from John later if negotiations with Alice don't go well. Let me try to negotiate with Alice first by rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

Rationale: I'll start with a counteroffer of $700,000 because:

1. It's below my maximum value of $800,000, which would allow me to save money if accepted
2. It's significantly below Alice's initial offer of $1,500,000, but not so low as to be completely unreasonable
3. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, while this offer would result in a loss for her, it gives room for negotiation
4. If Alice rejects this offer, I still have the option to either negotiate further or buy from John at $800,000
5. Starting lower gives me room to increase my offer in future negotiations while still staying under my maximum value"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Rationale: I'm choosing to buy from John because:

1. Alice's new offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly above my maximum value of $800,000
2. While Alice has reduced her price from $1,500,000 to $1,300,000, she's still far above both my maximum value and John's price
3. Given that the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, it's unlikely she'll go below that price as it would result in a loss for her
4. John's fixed price of $800,000 equals my maximum value, making it a fair deal
5. Continuing negotiations with Alice might not lead to a better outcome, as she seems committed to staying above her cost
6. It's time to take the guaranteed option rather than risk further negotiation rounds that might not improve the situation"
