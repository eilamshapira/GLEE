"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given the offer of $14,000 from Alice, and knowing the product is worth $15,000 to me, I should consider all options:

*   **Option 1: Accept Alice's offer:** Buying for $14,000 is better than buying from John for $15,000, and it's within my budget of $15,000.
*   **Option 2: Reject Alice's offer:** I don't know if I can negotiate the price down further, but this is an option to explore. However, it's possible that Alice may raise the price or sell to another buyer if I wait too long.
*   **Option 3: Buy from John:** This is the most expensive option, and should only be considered if I cannot reach an agreement with Alice.

Since the offer from Alice is within my budget and is cheaper than buying from John, I'll accept it to secure the product at the current price.
