"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price of $200 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $120. Since I can get the product from John for $120, there's no reason to accept such a high price. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 90}

I'll offer $90, which is well below John's price of $120. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing me to save money compared to buying from John. Since the product is worth $120 to Alice, there might be a chance she'll consider a price that still gives her some profit margin."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price of $170 is still much higher than John's price of $120. Since I can get the product from John for $120, there's no reason to accept a price that's $50 higher. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 100}

I'll increase my offer to $100. This is still below John's price of $120, giving me potential savings, while also showing some movement in the negotiation. The price would still give Alice a profit since the product is worth $120 to her. This demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate but am also aware I have the alternative option of buying from John at $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, Alice's offers are consistently remaining above John's price of $120, and she's not showing significant movement toward a price that would be better than John's offer. Since the product is only worth $120 to me, and I can get it from John for $120, it's best to end the negotiation and buy from John rather than continue with offers that are above my maximum value."
