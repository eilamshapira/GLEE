Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay for this product. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I can actually get it from another seller, John, for exactly $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. I'm willing to offer you $6000 for the product. This would save me some money compared to my alternative option, while still giving you a sale. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the lowest I can go is $12,000. This price reflects the value of the product and is still a good deal considering the quality and benefits it offers. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for lowering your price, Alice, but $12000 is still well above what I can justify spending. As I mentioned, this product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I have a guaranteed option to purchase it from John at exactly $8000. To make it worthwhile to buy from you instead, I need a better price than my alternative. I can offer you $7000, which would be my final offer. This gives you a sale today and saves me $1000 compared to buying from John. If we can't agree on this price, I'll unfortunately need to go with my other option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I need to meet a certain threshold. I can come down to $10,500, which is my lowest possible price. This is still a competitive offer and would allow you to get the product at a good value while supporting our business relationship. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to meet a certain threshold, but I also need to make a financially sound decision. Your offer of $10500 is still $2500 more than what I can pay John for the exact same product ($8000). The product is only worth $8000 to me at maximum, so paying more than that wouldn't make sense. Since we seem to be having trouble meeting in the middle, I'll make one last offer of $7500. This is truly my best offer - it saves me a small amount compared to my alternative with John, while still giving you a sale. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to go with John's offer.
