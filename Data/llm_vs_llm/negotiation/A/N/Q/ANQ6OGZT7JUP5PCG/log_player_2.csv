"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The offer from Alice is for $15,000, which is significantly higher than the $8,000 the product is worth to me. It's also higher than John's offering price of $8,000. Since Alice's price is nearly double what I'm willing to pay, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and I can actually get it from another seller, John, for exactly $8,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. I'm willing to offer you $6,000 for the product. This would save me some money compared to my alternative option, while still giving you a sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the lowest I can go is $12000. This price reflects the value of the product and is still a good deal considering the quality and benefits it offers. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $12,000 is still significantly higher than the $8,000 maximum value this product has to me. It's also $4,000 more than what I can pay John for the same product. Since I can get the product from John for $8,000, there's no reason for me to pay Alice $12,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for lowering your price, Alice, but $12,000 is still well above what I can justify spending. As I mentioned, this product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed option to purchase it from John at exactly $8,000. To make it worthwhile to buy from you instead, I need a better price than my alternative. I can offer you $7,000, which would be my final offer. This gives you a sale today and saves me $1,000 compared to buying from John. If we can't agree on this price, I'll unfortunately need to go with my other option."", ""product_price"": 7000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I need to meet a certain threshold. I can come down to $10500, which is my lowest possible price. This is still a competitive offer and would allow you to get the product at a good value while supporting our business relationship. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to meet a certain threshold, but I also need to make a financially sound decision. Your offer of $10,500 is still $2,500 more than what I can pay John for the exact same product ($8,000). The product is only worth $8,000 to me at maximum, so paying more than that wouldn't make sense. Since we seem to be having trouble meeting in the middle, I'll make one last offer of $7,500. This is truly my best offer - it saves me a small amount compared to my alternative with John, while still giving you a sale.
