"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $140 is still much higher than what I'm looking to spend. I can actually get the same product from another seller for $80. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair price. I can offer $75.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I want to work with you to find a suitable price point. I'm willing to come down to $125 for this round. This price acknowledges your budget constraints while also valuing my product.",125.0,Alice,5,
