"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer to purchase the product for $900000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that budget constraints are a consideration, but given the value of the product, I cannot go below $1500000. I believe this is a fair and competitive price for the quality you're getting. Let me know if this works for you.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $1500000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying. Considering the product's value and our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'd like to propose a price of $1200000. However, I'd like to see if we can do even better. I'm willing to make a serious offer to purchase the product for $1100000. Let me know if this is something you'd be open to.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
