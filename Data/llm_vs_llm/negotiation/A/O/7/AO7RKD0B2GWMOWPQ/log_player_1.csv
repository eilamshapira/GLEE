Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, I need to point out that I can purchase the same product from another seller for $1200000. This is the maximum value I place on this product based on my budget and needs. I'd like to offer you $1100000 for your product. This would save me some money compared to my alternative option while still providing you with a substantial sale. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you reducing your price, but I must be transparent with you. I have a firm alternative option to purchase this product from John for exactly $1200000. This is actually the maximum value I place on this product for my needs. To make it worthwhile to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer you $1150000, which would save me some money while still providing you with a sale. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $1200000, I'll need to proceed with my alternative option.
