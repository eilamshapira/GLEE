Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is significantly above what I'm looking to spend. The product is only worth $80 to me, which happens to be the same price another seller, John, is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to accept $60 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty, but $60 is too low for me to sell the product. I'm willing to go down to $130, considering your interest in doing business with me. Let me know what you think!""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to make a reasonable profit. How about we settle at $130? This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice, but $130 is still much more than I can justify spending. The product is only worth $80 to me, and I can get it from John for exactly that price. I understand you need to make a profit, but I need to be reasonable with my budget too. I can offer you $70, which would save me a bit compared to John's price while still giving you a sale, though at a smaller profit margin. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:

I'm willing to lower my price further to $125, which is very close to my minimum. This is the best I can do while still making a reasonable profit. Let me know if this works for you.""}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your situation, and I want to make this work for both of us.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to work with me, Alice, but $125 is still far above my maximum budget. Since the product is only worth $80 to me, and John is offering it at exactly that price, I need a compelling reason to pay more. I'm willing to go up to $75 to buy from you, which would save me $5 compared to John's offer. Please understand that I simply can't justify spending more than the product's value to me, and I already have a guaranteed option at $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your constraints, but $75 is still too low for me. I can go down to $120, which is my absolute minimum. This is the best I can do, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you can accept this offer.""}"

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $120, but I need to be clear about my situation. I value this product at no more than $80, and I can buy it from John for exactly $80. At $120, you're asking me to pay $40 more than the product is worth to me. I understand this is your absolute minimum, and I respect that you need to make a profit, but I simply cannot justify paying more than the product's value to me. My final offer is $80, which matches what I'd pay elsewhere. If you can accept this, great. If not, I'll need to go with John's offer.
