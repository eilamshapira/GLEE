Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $150. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer is $150, which is well above the maximum value of $80 that the product is worth to me. It also exceeds the price of $80 that John is offering.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is significantly above what I'm looking to spend. The product is only worth $80 to me, which happens to be the same price another seller, John, is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to accept $60 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to make a reasonable profit. How about we settle at $130? This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer of $130 is still significantly above both the maximum value of $80 that the product is worth to me and the alternative price of $80 from John. There's no reason for me to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice, but $130 is still much more than I can justify spending. The product is only worth $80 to me, and I can get it from John for exactly that price. I understand you need to make a profit, but I need to be reasonable with my budget too. I can offer you $70, which would save me a bit compared to John's price while still giving you a sale, though at a smaller profit margin."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your situation, and I want to make this work for both of us. I can go down to $125, which is the lowest I can go while still making a reasonable profit. Let me know if this is something you can consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer of $125 is still well above both the product's worth to me ($80) and John's price ($80). This offer doesn't make economic sense for me to accept.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to work with me, Alice, but $125 is still far above my maximum budget. Since the product is only worth $80 to me, and John is offering it at exactly that price, I need a compelling reason to pay more. I'm willing to go up to $75 to buy from you, which would save me $5 compared to John's offer. Please understand that I simply can't justify spending more than the product's value to me, and I already have a guaranteed option at $80."", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I really want to make this work for both of us. I can go down to $120, which is my absolute minimum. This is the best I can do, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you can accept this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer of $120 is still $40 above what the product is worth to me and $40 more than John's offer. This doesn't make financial sense for me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $120, but I need to be clear about my situation. I value this product at no more than $80, and I can buy it from John for exactly $80. At $120, you're asking me to pay $40 more than the product is worth to me. I understand this is your absolute minimum, and I respect that you need to make a profit, but I simply cannot justify paying more than the product's value to me. My final offer is $80, which matches what I'd pay elsewhere. If you can accept this, great. If not, I'll need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 80}"
