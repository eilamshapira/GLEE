Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you an incredible product that I believe you'll love. I'm offering it at a price of $200. What do you think?,200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While I can't go as low as $100, I can offer it to you for $180. I think it's a great value for what you're getting. Let me know your thoughts!",180.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate you coming down from $200, but $180 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a price of $110. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle somewhere. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Alice, thank you for continuing to work with me to find a mutually agreeable price. I appreciate you bringing the price down to $160, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. Considering I can buy the product from John for $120, I'd like to propose a price of $120. If you're willing to match that price, I'd be happy to buy from you instead.",120.0,Bob,6,
