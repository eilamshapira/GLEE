"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $11000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, and I'm open to negotiations.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  $11000 is a bit high for me though. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $6500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $6500 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with at the moment, but I'm open to further negotiations.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's value, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $8000. I can offer it to you for $9500, which is a significant compromise on my part. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I do have other options to consider if we can't come to an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further.  Would you consider $8250? That's a firm offer from my side.",8250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget. However, I'm still not comfortable with $8250. I can offer it to you for $9000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options. Please let me know if this is something you'd be interested in, or if we should part ways.",9000.0,Alice,7,
