Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, and I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  $11000 is a bit high for me though. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $6500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $6,500 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have a chance to negotiate a better price with Bob, and if that doesn't work out, I have the option to sell to John for $10,000. 

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $6,500 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $10,500."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8000? That would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is still lower than the product's worth to me and I have a better offer from John, I will reject Bob's offer. However, I want to try to get a better deal from Bob before considering John's offer. I will make another counteroffer to Bob.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $8,000. I can offer it to you for $9,500, which is a significant compromise on my part. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 9500}"

I can offer it to you for $9,500, which is a significant compromise on my part. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I do have other options to consider if we can't come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further.  Would you consider $8250? That's a firm offer from my side. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $8,250 is still lower than the product's worth to me and I have a better offer from John, I will reject Bob's offer. Bob mentioned that $8,250 is a firm offer from his side, which suggests that he may not be willing to go much higher. Considering this, I will make one more attempt to get a better deal from Bob before deciding whether to sell to John.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget. However, I'm still not comfortable with $8,250.
