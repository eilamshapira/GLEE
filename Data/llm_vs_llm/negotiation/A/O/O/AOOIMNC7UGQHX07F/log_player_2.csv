"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $11000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, and I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above my budget. I'll make a counteroffer to bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  $11,000 is a bit high for me though. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $6500 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with at the moment, but I'm open to further negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice is coming down, but very slowly. I'll counter with a price closer to my goal to see how much she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand the product's value, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $8000. I can offer it to you for $9500, which is a significant compromise on my part. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I do have other options to consider if we can't come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While $9,500 is getting closer, I'm still hesitant to go above my $8,000 limit.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further.  Would you consider $8,250? That's a firm offer from my side."",
""product_price"": 8250
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget. However, I'm still not comfortable with $8250. I can offer it to you for $9000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options. Please let me know if this is something you'd be interested in, or if we should part ways. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

Alice is clearly not budging much further, and I'm not willing to go above $8,250. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for my original budget."
