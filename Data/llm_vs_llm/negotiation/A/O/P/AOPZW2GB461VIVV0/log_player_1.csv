Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll reject Bob's offer since it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 (which I can get from John). This offer is significantly lower than both my initial ask and my reservation price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let me make a counteroffer of $2,000,000."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below what I can get from John ($1,500,000), and Bob's increments in offers are relatively small, I'll choose to sell to John to secure the better price and end the negotiation.
