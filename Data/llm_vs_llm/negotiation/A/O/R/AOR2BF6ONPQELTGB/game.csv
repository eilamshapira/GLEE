"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $12000. I would like to make a counteroffer of $10000. This would save you the hassle of finding another buyer and give you a quick sale. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is too low for the value of this product. I understand you have another option, but I'm confident in the quality and value of what I'm offering. How about we settle at $18000? I believe this is a fair price for us both.",18000.0,Alice,3,
