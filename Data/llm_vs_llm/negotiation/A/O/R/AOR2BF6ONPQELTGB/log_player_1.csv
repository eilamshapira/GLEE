Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $12000. I would like to make a counteroffer of $10000. This would save you the hassle of finding another buyer and give you a quick sale. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for the value of this product. I understand you have another option, but I'm confident in the quality and value of what I'm offering. How about we settle at $18,000? I believe this is a fair price for us both."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
