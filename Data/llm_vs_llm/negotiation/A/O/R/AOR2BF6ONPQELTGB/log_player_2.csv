"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I would like to offer it to you for $25000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
Rationale: The offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $12,000, and it's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $12,000. It would be reasonable to reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as there might be room for negotiation to get a better price than John's $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25,000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $12,000. I would like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. This would save you the hassle of finding another buyer and give you a quick sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is too low for the value of this product. I understand you have another option, but I'm confident in the quality and value of what I'm offering. How about we settle at $18000? I believe this is a fair price for us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
Rationale: Alice's new offer of $18,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's guaranteed price ($12,000). Since Alice hasn't shown willingness to go below $18,000, and this is still $6,000 more than John's price, it makes the most economic sense to end the negotiation with Alice and purchase from John at $12,000."
