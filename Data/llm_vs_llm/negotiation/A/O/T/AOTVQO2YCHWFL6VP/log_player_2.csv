"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Based on market analysis and the unique value this product delivers, I'm offering it to you at $1200000. This represents excellent value considering the product's capabilities and the competitive advantage it will give you. I should mention that I already have another interested buyer, John, who has confirmed he will purchase at $1000000, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity. I look forward to your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is clearly trying to pressure me into a bad deal. She's lying about John being willing to buy it for $1,000,000 because I already know John will sell it to me for that price as a last resort.  I'll go with John and get the fair price."
