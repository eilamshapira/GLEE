(Alice is getting closer, but still far above the price I'm willing to pay. I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to what I want to pay, but I'm strongly considering John's offer if Alice doesn't drop her price significantly.)

Counteroffer: $700,000

(If Alice rejects this offer, I might consider buying from John, as we're running out of negotiation rounds and Alice's price is still much higher than John's.)"

(Alice's price is still much higher than what John is offering. With only one round left and Alice not coming close to the price I'm willing to pay, it's better to buy from John.)"
