"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'm considering Alice's offer of $900,000. Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice and no more than $1,000,000 to me, there's room for negotiation. Alice's offer of $900,000 is better than John's price of $1,000,000, but I should try to get a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial price but still gives her some profit above her value of $800,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has come down from her initial $900,000 to $875,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is already better than John's price of $1,000,000 by $125,000. However, since we have more rounds available and Alice's cost is $800,000, I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can get a slightly better price.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $865,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $865,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has reduced her price to $865,000, which is a good sign. We're getting closer to a middle ground between our positions. Her price is significantly better than John's $1,000,000 offer. Since we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and the price difference is narrowing, I'll accept this offer to secure the deal.
