Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 15000}

Rationale: Since I know that:
1. The product is worth $10,000 to Bob
2. I can sell it to John for $15,000
3. The product is worth no less than $15,000 to me

There's no reason for me to offer Bob a price lower than $15,000. If Bob accepts, I get $15,000. If Bob rejects (which is likely since the price is above his valuation), I can still sell to John for $15,000. This way, I ensure I get the maximum possible value for the product."
