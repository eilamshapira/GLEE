"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2300000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800000 for it.  This price reflects the maximum value I'm willing to spend.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $800000 is significantly below my initial asking price, I understand you see value in the product.  I'm willing to come down to $1900000.  I believe this price point represents a significant compromise and reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for coming down on the price.  $1900000 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1000000.  This is a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my strong interest in the product.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable figure. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher price point. However, I value your initial interest and am willing to make one more move to $1600000. This is my final offer, as I need to reach a decision quickly.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
