"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:

Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I certainly can't let the product go for 60 USD, but maybe we can agree on a higher price. How about:

{""product_price"": 100}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I see that we are getting closer to a deal but we are not quite there yet. I am willing to lower my price a bit more, so here is my final offer:

{""product_price"": 90}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75.
