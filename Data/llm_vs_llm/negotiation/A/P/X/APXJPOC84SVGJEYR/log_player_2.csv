"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Looking at the options:

1. If I accept Alice's offer, I would pay $1,500,000 for the product
2. If I reject Alice's offer, I have no product
3. If I buy from John, I would pay $1,000,000 for the product

Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and John is offering to sell it at exactly $1,000,000, I would save $500,000 by buying from John rather than Alice. Also, buying from John guarantees I get the product, which is my goal.
