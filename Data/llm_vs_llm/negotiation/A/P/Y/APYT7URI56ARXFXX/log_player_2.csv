"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer ($20,000) is significantly higher than my maximum valuation ($10,000) and John's offer ($10,000), the rational choice is to buy from John.
