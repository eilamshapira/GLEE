"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $10000 as it's below my minimum price point. I understand $15000 might be too high for you, so I can offer the product for $13500. This is a more competitive price that still reflects the product's true value.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is the highest I can offer while staying within my budget. Let me know if this works for you.",11000.0,Bob,4,
