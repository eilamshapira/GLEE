Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it for $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Since Bob's offer is lower than what John is willing to pay, I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $10,000 as it's below my minimum price point. I understand $15,000 might be too high for you, so I can offer the product for $13,500. This is a more competitive price that still reflects the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is the highest I can offer while staying within my budget. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's highest offer of $11,000 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $12,000, and we seem to be quite far apart in our price expectations, I'll take the sure deal with John. This ensures I get my minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
