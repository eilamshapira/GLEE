"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $800000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $2000000? This reflects the true worth of the product.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $2000000 is still too high for me. I could go up to $900000 if you're willing to come down a bit more.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1800000. This is a significant concession on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
