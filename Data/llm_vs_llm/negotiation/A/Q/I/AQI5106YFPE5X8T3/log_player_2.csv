Let's make a counteroffer to Alice. How about we offer $8,000 for the product? This way, we can try to get the product below Alice's valuation of $10,000 and save some money. If Alice agrees, we get the product for less. If not, we can still consider buying from John later."

Alice is still offering a price above our budget. Let's make another counteroffer to see if we can get the price closer to our goal. This time, let's offer $9,000 and see how Alice responds."

Alice's offer is still too high, and it seems like we're not making progress towards our budget goal. Since John is willing to sell the product for $10,000, which is within our budget, let's buy the product from John."
