"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer is $150, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and buying from John would also cost me $150, I might as well reject Alice's offer and see if I can get a better deal from her or consider other options before buying from John at the same price.
