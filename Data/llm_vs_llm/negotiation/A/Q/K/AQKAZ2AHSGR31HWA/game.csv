"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, the price of $1000000 is below our expectations. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1200000. This price reflects the high value and exclusivity of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to lower my previous offer to $1100000.

"Hello Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this price reflects a fair value for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",900000.0,Bob,4,
"Hello Bob, thank you for your latest offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900000 is still below what we believe the product is worth. I'm prepared to offer the product at $1000000, which is a substantial compromise on our part. I hope you'll consider this as it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but I feel the product's value is still not fully reflected in our current offers.

What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for continuing to negotiate with me. I'm getting closer to my target price, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your current offer, so I'll offer $925000. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",925000.0,Bob,6,
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. However, $925000 is still below our minimum threshold. I'm willing to lower my offer to $940000, which is a significant concession on our part. This price is very close to your latest offer and reflects our desire to reach an agreement. Please let me know if this works for you.",940000.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, we're very close to reaching an agreement. I'm willing to come down to $935000, which is just a small step from your last offer. This price is our final offer and represents a fair compromise. I hope we can close the deal at this price. What do you think?",935000.0,Alice,7,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Since you've mentioned that $935000 is your final offer, I'll make a small concession as well.
