Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  It's unique and has a lot of potential.  I'm offering it to you for $15000. What do you think?,15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was looking to spend no more than $10000. How about we settle at this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13000?  This would still leave a comfortable margin for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice. But $13000 is still a bit high for me. Can we meet in the middle at $11000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference at $12000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,
