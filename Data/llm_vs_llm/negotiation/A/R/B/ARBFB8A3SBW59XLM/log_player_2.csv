"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's price ($1,500,000), I'll reject this offer. I can either make a counteroffer to Alice in the next round or ultimately buy from John if we can't reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'll offer $1,200,000, which is significantly below John's price of $1,500,000. This gives room for negotiation while potentially saving money compared to buying from John. If Alice rejects this offer, we can continue negotiating, or I always have the option to go with John's offer as a fallback."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $1,500,000. Here's why:
1. The price matches John's price ($1,500,000)
2. It's at my maximum value threshold ($1,500,000)
3. Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $1,800,000
4. There's no guarantee that further negotiation would result in a better price
5. If I reject this offer, Alice might increase the price again in future rounds

Since we've reached a price that matches the best alternative (John's price), it's sensible to accept this offer now."
