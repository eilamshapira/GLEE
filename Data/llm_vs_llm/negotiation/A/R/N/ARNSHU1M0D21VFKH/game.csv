"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer, but $90 is too low for this product. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. Given the product's value, I can offer it to you for $120. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents excellent value for such a quality item.",120.0,Alice,3,
