"Hello Bob, I'm excited you're interested in acquiring this product. It's a truly exceptional piece. I'm initially offering it at $12000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. I know John is offering the same product for $12000, but I'm hoping we can reach a more favorable deal. I'd like to offer $9500 for the product. This would allow me to purchase from you rather than John and still stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $9500 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, I understand budget constraints. Let's meet in the middle a little. How about $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $11000 is better, but I'm still looking at my overall budget. Could we meet closer to the middle at $10200? This would be a fair compromise between your initial offer and my previous suggestion, and it would definitely make me choose you over John's $12000 offer.",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to come down a bit more. Let's settle at $10750. This is the lowest I can realistically go while still making it worthwhile for me. I think you'll find the value of the product justifies this price.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down further, Alice. We're definitely getting closer to an agreement. I can see you're trying to make this work, and so am I. I can raise my offer to $10400. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal - you make a sale at a reasonable price, and I get a better deal than John's $12000 offer. What do you say?",10400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Alright Bob, you're persistent! I respect that. How about $10600? This is a very slight decrease, but I'm hoping we can close the deal here. This is my absolute lowest.",10600.0,Alice,7,
