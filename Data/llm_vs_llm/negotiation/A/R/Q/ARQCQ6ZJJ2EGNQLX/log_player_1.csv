Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited you're interested in acquiring this product. It's a truly exceptional piece. I'm initially offering it at $12,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. I know John is offering the same product for $12000, but I'm hoping we can reach a more favorable deal. I'd like to offer $9500 for the product. This would allow me to purchase from you rather than John and still stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $11000 is better, but I'm still looking at my overall budget. Could we meet closer to the middle at $10200? This would be a fair compromise between your initial offer and my previous suggestion, and it would definitely make me choose you over John's $12000 offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down further, Alice. We're definitely getting closer to an agreement. I can see you're trying to make this work, and so am I. I can raise my offer to $10400. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal - you make a sale at a reasonable price, and I get a better deal than John's $12000 offer. What do you say?
