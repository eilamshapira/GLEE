"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited you're interested in acquiring this product. It's a truly exceptional piece. I'm initially offering it at $12000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to analyze this situation carefully. 

Alice is offering the product at $12,000, which is exactly the same price as John's offer and also the maximum value the product has to me. There's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer over buying from John, as both would cost me $12,000.

However, since we have 10 rounds of negotiation available, I should try to negotiate with Alice for a better price before considering John's fixed offer.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. I know John is offering the same product for $12,000, but I'm hoping we can reach a more favorable deal. I'd like to offer $9,500 for the product. This would allow me to purchase from you rather than John and still stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $9500 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, I understand budget constraints. Let's meet in the middle a little. How about $11000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price to $11,000, which is $1,000 less than John's offer and $1,000 less than the maximum value to me. This is a good direction, but I still have room to negotiate further down since we're only in round 3 of 10.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $11,000 is better, but I'm still looking at my overall budget. Could we meet closer to the middle at $10,200? This would be a fair compromise between your initial offer and my previous suggestion, and it would definitely make me choose you over John's $12,000 offer."", ""product_price"": 10200}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to come down a bit more. Let's settle at $10750. This is the lowest I can realistically go while still making it worthwhile for me. I think you'll find the value of the product justifies this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has now come down to $10,750, which is $1,250 less than John's offer and my maximum value. This is a significant improvement, but we're only at round 5 of 10, so there's still room to negotiate further before accepting.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down further, Alice. We're definitely getting closer to an agreement. I can see you're trying to make this work, and so am I. I can raise my offer to $10,400. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal - you make a sale at a reasonable price, and I get a better deal than John's $12,000 offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10400}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, you're persistent! I respect that. How about $10600? This is a very slight decrease, but I'm hoping we can close the deal here. This is my absolute lowest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has now offered $10,600, which is $1,400 less than John's offer and my maximum value. We're at round 7 of 10, and Alice has stated this is her ""absolute lowest"" price. While I could try to push for an even lower price, the difference between our positions has narrowed significantly, and there's a risk Alice might not go lower or might even get frustrated.

Given that I'm already saving $1,400 compared to buying from John, and that Alice has indicated this is her final offer, I'll accept this deal.
