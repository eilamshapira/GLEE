"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. After careful consideration, I've decided on a price that I believe reflects its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Looking at the details:
- The product is worth at most $1,500,000 to you
- Alice's offer is $1,400,000
- If you reject Alice's offer, you can buy from John for $1,500,000

Alice's offer ($1,400,000) is $100,000 less than John's price ($1,500,000). Since both offers are within your maximum value, but Alice's offer allows you to save $100,000, it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer.
