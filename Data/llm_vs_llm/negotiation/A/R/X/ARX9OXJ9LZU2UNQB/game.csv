"Hi Bob, thank you for getting back to me. I understand that $140 might be a bit high for you, but I believe the quality of the product justifies the price. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle and lower my offer to $130. This is a great deal for an item of this quality. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",130.0,Alice,3,
