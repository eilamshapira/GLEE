"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $140. It's a high-quality item that I think you'll find very useful. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John offers.  It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering your product.  While I agree it looks useful, $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting significantly lower encourages Alice to engage in negotiation and reveals information about your price ceiling without immediately offering your maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for getting back to me. I understand that $140 might be a bit high for you, but I believe the quality of the product justifies the price. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle and lower my offer to $130. This is a great deal for an item of this quality. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

```

Alice is coming down, but slowly.  Still room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, $130 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $95?"",
""product_price"": 95 
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're increasing our offer to show willingness to compromise, but still staying well below her price and below our max budget.  This gradual increase should encourage her to continue negotiating."
