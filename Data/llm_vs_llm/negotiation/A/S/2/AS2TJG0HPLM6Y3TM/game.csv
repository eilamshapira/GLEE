"Hello Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for what I believe is a fair price considering its quality and benefits. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. How does $180 sound?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I believe a fair price would be around $90, considering the market and my needs.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but $90 is too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, how about we meet in the middle at $150? I think that's a very reasonable price considering its value.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. However, $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $100, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my needs.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $100 is still less than what I'm willing to let it go for. How about we try $140?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. However, $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $110, which I believe is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",110.0,Bob,6,
