Alice's offer is far too high. We have plenty of room to negotiate and John's offer provides a good fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $75}

We're starting with a low offer to see how Alice reacts. This leaves a lot of room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below John's offer."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice came down slightly, the offer is still much higher than our target and even our previous counteroffer. We'll continue negotiating and see if we can meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $100}

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but very slowly.  We're still far from a price I'm willing to accept. I'd rather see if she's willing to negotiate closer to my range before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $115}

Increasing the offer slightly again shows we're willing to compromise, but we're still holding firm below $150. This keeps the pressure on Alice while leaving us with a comfortable margin."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

We're getting closer, but $185 is still too high. We're entering a phase where we might need to consider John's offer soon if Alice doesn't move significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $130}

This is a significant jump in my offer, signaling that I'm getting closer to my limit. It puts the ball in Alice's court and shows that I'm serious about closing the deal, but only at a price that works for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice doesn't seem willing to budge enough to make a deal worthwhile. It's time to cut our losses and take John's offer. We've negotiated well, but sometimes the best deals come from knowing when to walk away."
