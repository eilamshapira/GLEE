"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited you're interested in the product! I believe it would be a valuable asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $18000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than John's fixed price of $10,000 (and higher than my maximum value of $10,000), it would not be rational to accept this offer. While I could reject and make a counteroffer, given that Alice's initial offer is so high, it might take several rounds of negotiation to reach a reasonable price, if at all. In this case, the best option is to buy from John.
