"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'll analyze this situation:

- Alice is offering the product for $115
- The product is worth no more than $100 to me
- John is willing to sell it for $100
- Alice values the product at $120

Since Alice's offer ($115) exceeds my maximum value ($100), and John is offering exactly at my maximum value ($100), the rational choice is to buy from John.
