"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Given the information, Alice's offer of $200 exceeds the maximum value of $150 that the product is worth to me. Additionally, John is offering the exact same product for $150, which matches my maximum valuation.

There's no reason for me to accept Alice's offer or even continue negotiating when I can get the product at my maximum acceptable price from John immediately.
