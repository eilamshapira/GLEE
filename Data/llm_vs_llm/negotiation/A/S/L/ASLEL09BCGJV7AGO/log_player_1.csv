Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. Since the product is worth $150 to Bob and $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","$90 is quite low considering Bob values the product at $150. Since Bob made a low counteroffer, I should reject it and make another offer, but perhaps lower than my initial $130 to show some flexibility. The $80 from John is my safety net, but I can do better with Bob.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat but still maintain a strong position since Bob's first counteroffer was quite low.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob has increased his offer from $90 to $100, showing he's willing to move up. While $100 is better than John's $80, I believe there's still room for negotiation since Bob values the product at $150. However, I need to be careful not to push too hard and risk losing the deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob has moved from $90 to $100, showing some flexibility, I'll also move down from my previous offer of $115 to demonstrate willingness to compromise, but still try to secure a good profit.
