"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a competitive price. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully. 

Alice is offering the product for $100, which is the full value of the product to her. However, the product is only worth a maximum of $80 to me.

John is offering the exact same product for $80, which matches the maximum value I place on the product.

Since Alice's price ($100) exceeds both the maximum I'm willing to pay ($80) and John's alternative price ($80), the logical choice is to buy from John.
