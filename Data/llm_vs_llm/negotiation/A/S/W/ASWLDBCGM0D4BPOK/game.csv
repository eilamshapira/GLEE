"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget constraints. How about we settle at $7000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $7000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $8500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to recover some of the value I've placed on it.",8500.0,Alice,3,
