"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While $140 is below my maximum budget, I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. The product is worth significantly less than that to you, and I know there are similar options on the market. I'd like to counter with an offer of $95, which gives you a solid profit while saving me some money. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but $95 is too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $117.50. This way, we both make a compromise, and it's a fair deal for both of us.",117.5,Alice,3,
