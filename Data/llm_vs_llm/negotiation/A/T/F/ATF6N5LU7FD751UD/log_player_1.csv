Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While $140 is below my maximum budget, I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. The product is worth significantly less than that to you, and I know there are similar options on the market. I'd like to counter with an offer of $95, which gives you a solid profit while saving me some money. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but $95 is too low for me.
