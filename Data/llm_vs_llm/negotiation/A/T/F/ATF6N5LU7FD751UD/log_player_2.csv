"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $140. It's a great value and I think you'll be very happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice is offering the product for $140, which is less than the maximum I'm willing to pay ($150), but I can try to get a better price through negotiation. Since the product is worth only $80 to Alice, there's room to negotiate a lower price. If I fail in negotiation, I can always buy from John for $150 as a backup.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While $140 is below my maximum budget, I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. The product is worth significantly less than that to you, and I know there are similar options on the market.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but $95 is too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $117.50. This way, we both make a compromise, and it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has countered with $117.50, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $140. This price is well below my maximum budget of $150 and represents a fair middle ground between her initial price and my counteroffer. Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, she's still making a profit, and I'm getting a price that's considerably better than John's offer of $150. This seems like a reasonable deal.
