"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm Alice. I have this great product that I'm looking to sell. I know it's worth $80 to you, and I'm offering it to you at exactly that price - $80. This is a fair deal as you'll receive the full value of the product. If you're not interested, that's no problem - I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase it at this price. Would you like to accept my offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
