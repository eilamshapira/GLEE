"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $15000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $6000 for the product. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you coming back to me. However, I can't go as low as $6000. How about we meet in the middle? I'll offer it to you for $13500.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $13500 is still too high for me. I can go up to $7000. Let me know if this works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still firm on my price, since I know how much the product is worth. I can't accept $7000. But to show I'm willing to work with you, I'll come down a little. How about $13000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still out of my budget. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $7500. Can we make a deal at this price?",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I am starting to get worried that this won't work out. I still can't sell for $7500. How about we try $12500? This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit.",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but $12500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $7800. This is my final offer before considering other options. What do you say?",7800.0,Bob,8,
