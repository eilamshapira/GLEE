"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product, which is still a significant amount given my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $18000, considering the product's exceptional quality and the value it can bring. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to meet somewhere closer to my initial offer.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $18000 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $15500, which is a significant amount and a good middle ground for us both. This is my final offer, I hope we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,4,
