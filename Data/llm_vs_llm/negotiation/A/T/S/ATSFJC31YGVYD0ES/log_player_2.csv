"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I know you value this product and I'm confident it will be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $11500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $12,000
2. Alice is offering the product for $11,500
3. John's fixed price is $12,000
4. Alice's product is worth $8,000 to her

Alice's offer of $11,500 is below my maximum value ($12,000), and it's $500 less than John's price. While Alice still has a significant profit margin ($3,500), her offer is the better deal compared to John's price. 

Since I want to save money and Alice's offer is the lowest available price, I should accept her offer.
