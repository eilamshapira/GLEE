Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Considering its value and the potential it unlocks, I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering current market conditions and my budget limits, I'm prepared to propose $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point. Let me know if we can work with that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $900,000, I'm not ready to settle for that just yet. I believe I can get a better price.

My decision: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you coming back with a proposal. While I respect your budget, the product's true value and the benefits it provides are significantly higher. Therefore, I'm willing to meet you closer to my initial asking price. I propose a price of $1,100,000."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your revised proposal. I appreciate your flexibility and recognize the product's value, but I must stay within my budget. Would you be willing to settle at $1000000? I believe this figure fairly reflects both our positions, and closing at this price would be beneficial for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","This is a crucial decision point. Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly better than selling to John for $800,000. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, the profit margin at $1,000,000 is still substantial. I also want to avoid the risk of Bob walking away or driving the price down further. I believe that accepting Bob's offer is the most beneficial option.

My decision: {""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
