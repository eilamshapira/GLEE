"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Let me evaluate this situation:

Alice is offering the product for $20,000, but it's worth no more than $10,000 to me. John is willing to sell the same product for $10,000.

Since Alice's offer ($20,000) exceeds both the product's value to me and John's guaranteed offer ($10,000), there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer.

I could reject and make a counteroffer, but since John is offering exactly the maximum value the product is worth to me ($10,000), I should take that guaranteed option rather than risking further negotiation with Alice.
