"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Starting High (But Not Insanely High):** I'm starting with a price that's significantly above my minimum of $800,000, but not so outrageous that Bob immediately walks away. I want to gauge his interest level and perceived value of the product. $1,200,000 allows room for negotiation.
*   **Strategic Thinking:** I need to leave room for multiple counteroffers and ensure I can still get a good price even if we go back and forth a few times.
*   **John as Backup:** Knowing I have John as a guaranteed $800,000 safety net is important. It gives me leverage to be a bit more assertive in my initial pricing."
