"Bob, I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you.  Considering its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1400000.  Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, I believe your initial price is a bit high. Given the market conditions, I would be comfortable with $1150000, which would still provide you with a healthy profit margin. How does that sound?",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the market, but $1150000 doesn't quite reflect the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1300000. This price still offers a significant benefit to both of us.  Let's find a compromise that works.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. To meet you partway, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1225000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and would give you a healthy profit margin while still being fair to both parties. What do you think?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1225000 still feels a bit low given the value of this product.  To move things forward, I'm offering a final price of $1275000.  This offer is fair to both of us, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you.  Let's close this deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
