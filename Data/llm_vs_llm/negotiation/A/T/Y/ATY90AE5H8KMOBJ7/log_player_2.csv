"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer is the same price as John's offer ($15,000), and this is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I should reject and try to negotiate a better price with Alice. If negotiations fail, I can always fall back to John's offer later.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low that it's unreasonable.

{""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price to $14,000, which is $1,000 less than John's offer. While this is a better deal, there might still be room for negotiation. However, I need to be careful not to push too hard and risk losing this better offer. Given that I have 7 more rounds and Alice has already shown willingness to negotiate, I'll try one more counter.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $15,000 to $14,000, I'll increase my previous offer but still try to get a better deal.
