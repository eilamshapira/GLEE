"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product, $12000 is a bit too high for me. Considering I can buy it from another seller for $8000, I'm willing to offer $7500. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $7500 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and the fact that I have another buyer willing to pay a higher price, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $10500, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with at this point.",10500.0,Alice,3,
