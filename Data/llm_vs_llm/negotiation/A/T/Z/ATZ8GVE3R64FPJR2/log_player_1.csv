Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product, $12000 is a bit too high for me. Considering I can buy it from another seller for $8000, I'm willing to offer $7500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.

I can offer it to you for $10,500, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with at this point."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
