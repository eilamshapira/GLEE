"Alice, your product is intriguing, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it.  It's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it, and it's within my budget. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1100000. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that my initial offer was a bit higher than you're comfortable with. However, considering the product's unique value and the fact that I have another buyer willing to pay $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer a slight discount from my initial price, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's discuss a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we meet in the middle at $1250000?  This would give you a good price, and it would be a good deal for me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
