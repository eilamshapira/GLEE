Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is intriguing, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it.  It's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it, and it's within my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us. My counteroffer will be $1,400,000, which is still below my initial offer but higher than Bob's counteroffer, giving him room to negotiate further while also considering the product's value to me."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1,100,000. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that my initial offer was a bit higher than you're comfortable with. However, considering the product's unique value and the fact that I have another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer a slight discount from my initial price, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's discuss a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we meet in the middle at $1250000?  This would give you a good price, and it would be a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is higher than the $1,200,000 I can get from John, and it's a good compromise considering the negotiations we've had. Accepting this offer ensures I get a better price than what's available from John, and it concludes the negotiation on a positive note for both parties."
