Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1100000. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that my initial offer was a bit higher than you're comfortable with. However, considering the product's unique value and the fact that I have another buyer willing to pay $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer a slight discount from my initial price, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's discuss a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
