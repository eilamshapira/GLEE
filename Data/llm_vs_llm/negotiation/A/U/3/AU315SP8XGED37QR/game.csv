"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Given that I can get a similar product elsewhere for $100, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80. This would save me money compared to my other option while giving you a quick sale.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $80 is below the product's value to me. Considering the product's quality and uniqueness, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $220. This price is more in line with the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair offer.",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I need to be clear that this product is worth no more than $100 to me. In fact, I can purchase it from another seller at that price. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation and offer $90. This is higher than my previous offer and would still give you a quick sale rather than risk losing the sale entirely.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $90 is still below the product's value to me. I understand that you can purchase it from another seller at $100, but I believe my product has some unique features that make it worth more. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $200. This price takes into account your concerns while still reflecting the product's worth to me.",200.0,Alice,5,
