Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Given that I can get a similar product elsewhere for $100, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80. This would save me money compared to my other option while giving you a quick sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I need to be clear that this product is worth no more than $100 to me. In fact, I can purchase it from another seller at that price.
