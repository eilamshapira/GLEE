Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Given that I can get a similar product elsewhere for $100, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80. This would save me money compared to my other option while giving you a quick sale."", ""product_price"": 80}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $80 is below the product's value to me. Considering the product's quality and uniqueness, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $220. This price is more in line with the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair offer.

This is higher than my previous offer and would still give you a quick sale rather than risk losing the sale entirely."", ""product_price"": 90}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $90 is still below the product's value to me.
