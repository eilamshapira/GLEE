You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay, and I have the option to buy the product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in accepting Alice's offer immediately. However, I also don't want to give up the potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. This will give us room to negotiate and potentially find a mutually acceptable price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $14,000 is more reasonable, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since I have 8 rounds left to negotiate, I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to make a more aggressive counteroffer to see how low Alice is willing to go.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's previous offer was $14,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is lower, but not extremely low. I'll aim for a price that is around the midpoint between my previous offer ($5,000) and Alice's previous offer ($14,000).

{""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $13,000 is getting closer to what I'm willing to pay, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since Alice has already come down by $2,000 from her initial offer, I'm hopeful that she may be willing to negotiate further.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one, to see if I can meet Alice in the middle.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's previous offer was $13,000, and my previous counteroffer was $9,500, I'll make a new counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one. I'll aim for a price that is around $11,000 to $12,000, to see if I can meet Alice in the middle.
