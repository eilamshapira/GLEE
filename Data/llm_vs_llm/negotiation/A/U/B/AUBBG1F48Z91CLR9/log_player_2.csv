"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that Alice's offer is $100 and John's fixed price is also $100, there's no advantage in accepting Alice's current offer or buying from John. The best strategy would be to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, as this gives us a chance to potentially get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's $100 offer, but not so low as to be insulting. Since the product is worth up to $100 to me, I'll start with a lower price to leave room for negotiation.
