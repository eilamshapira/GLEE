"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. Based on market analysis, this product is valued at around $950000. However, I'm willing to offer it to you at $920000, which provides you with substantial value while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. This price represents a good opportunity for both of us - you'll gain a product worth $1000000 to your operations, giving you an $80000 value advantage, while I can avoid selling it at my minimum acceptable price. Let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer.",920000.0,Alice,1,
