"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. Based on market analysis, this product is valued at around $950000. However, I'm willing to offer it to you at $920000, which provides you with substantial value while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. This price represents a good opportunity for both of us - you'll gain a product worth $1000000 to your operations, giving you an $80000 value advantage, while I can avoid selling it at my minimum acceptable price. Let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
