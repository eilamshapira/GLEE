"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1200000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest, but $700000 is still too low. How about we meet in the middle? I'd be willing to sell the product for $900000.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I can’t go as low as $750000. How about I sell the product for $850000? I think it’s a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $800000 even?",800000.0,Bob,6,
