"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $12500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $12500 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $9500? That would work much better for me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I understand the product needs to fit your budget. How about we split the difference again and land at $11000?  This is a significant discount from my original asking price.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11000 is still pushing it for me. I can do $10000, and I think that's a very fair offer. It's the most I can justify spending on this.",10000.0,Bob,6,
