"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I notice that Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is actually $200,000 more than the product is worth to me (my maximum value is $1,000,000). It's also $200,000 more than John's fixed price of $1,000,000.

Since Alice's current offer exceeds my maximum value and is higher than my alternative option, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I notice that Alice has reduced her offer from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this offer is still $100,000 more than both my maximum valuation and John's fixed price of $1,000,000.

Since I have the guaranteed option to buy from John at $1,000,000, and Alice's current offer exceeds that price, I should reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has come down further to $1,050,000, which shows she's continuing to negotiate. However, this is still $50,000 more than John's fixed price of $1,000,000.

Since I have the guaranteed option to buy from John at $1,000,000, and Alice's current offer still exceeds that price, I should reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has now come down to $1,000,000, which is exactly the same as John's fixed price and equal to my maximum valuation for the product. 

At this point, I'm indifferent between accepting Alice's offer and buying from John, as both options cost me $1,000,000. Since we've already invested time in negotiating with Alice and she's shown willingness to reduce her price, I'll accept her offer.
