Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 100}

I choose to offer the product at $100 because:
1. This is Bob's maximum valuation of the product
2. If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell to John for $100
3. Since Bob is indifferent between buying at $100 and not buying (as it's worth $100 to him), offering a higher price would guarantee rejection
4. Offering a lower price would reduce my profit unnecessarily"
