"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that Alice's offer is $100 and John is also willing to sell the product for $100, there is no financial advantage to accepting Alice's offer over buying from John. However, since the goal is to buy the product and save as much money as possible, and both offers are equivalent in price, I will accept Alice's offer to ensure I get the product.
