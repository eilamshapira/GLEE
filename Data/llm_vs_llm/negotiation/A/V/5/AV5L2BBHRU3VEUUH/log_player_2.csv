"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. If you're interested, please consider my offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Reasoning: Since I value the product at no more than $80, and John is offering it at exactly $80, while Alice's offer is significantly higher at $200, it makes the most economic sense to buy from John. Alice's offer is more than double my maximum valuation, so it would not be a rational choice to accept her offer."
