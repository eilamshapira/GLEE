Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. 

Since I know I have a guaranteed backup offer of $1,500,000 from John, I can afford to be somewhat aggressive with my initial offer to Bob. Given that Bob's valuation is unknown, I'll aim high while still keeping the price potentially reasonable for a valuable product.

I'll set the price at $2,300,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. If Bob values the product highly, he might accept. If he rejects, I still have my guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.
