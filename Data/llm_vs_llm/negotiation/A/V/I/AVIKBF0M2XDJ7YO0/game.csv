"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $150, I can't go that low as the product is worth more than that to me. However, I can come down from my initial price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250. This is a quality product that offers great value, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?",250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $200. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can make a deal.",200.0,Bob,4,
