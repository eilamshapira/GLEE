This product has excellent features and durability that justify this price point. I'd be happy to discuss the details further if you have any questions.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given that Alice is offering the product for $12,500, which is more than both your maximum valuation ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000), the logical choice is to buy from John.
