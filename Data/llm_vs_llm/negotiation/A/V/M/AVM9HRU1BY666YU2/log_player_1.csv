Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a high but reasonable offer to leave room for potential negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $500,000 as it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and even below John's guaranteed offer. Since Bob's initial offer is so low, it suggests he might not be willing to reach a price point that would be acceptable to me. Therefore, the safest and most profitable decision is to sell to John.
