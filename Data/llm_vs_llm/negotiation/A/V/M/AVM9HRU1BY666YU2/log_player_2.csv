"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($800,000), it's not a good deal for me. I'd like to try to negotiate a better price. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm not sure what Alice's bottom line is, I'll start with a low offer and see how she responds.
