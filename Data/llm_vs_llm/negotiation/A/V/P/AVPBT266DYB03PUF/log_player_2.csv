"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that I can buy the product from John for $10,000 and the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, it would be irrational to accept Alice's offer of $20,000 which is twice the amount I value the product at. 

Since I have the option to buy from John at $10,000, which matches my maximum valuation, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice when her initial offer is so high above my maximum price point.

Therefore, the most logical decision is to buy from John.
