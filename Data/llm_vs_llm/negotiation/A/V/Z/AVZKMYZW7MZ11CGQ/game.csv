"Hi Bob, I have a great product to offer you. I understand the value of this product and I'm confident in its quality. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's capabilities and market value.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is a bit too high for me.  This product would be very useful for me, so I'm willing to offer $10000.  I think that's a fair price that considers both its value and my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. However, $10000 is too low considering the product's quality and market value. I understand budget concerns, but I need to ensure I receive fair compensation. I have another buyer interested at $15000, but I'd like to work with you. I can reduce my price to $16000, which is a $2000 reduction from my initial offer. This is a competitive price given the product's capabilities.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down from your initial offer. However,  $16000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $11000.  This is a significant increase on my end, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. I do appreciate your interest in the product. However, $11000 is still below what I can accept for this product. I should mention that I have John willing to purchase it for $15000, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. My lowest acceptable price is $15000, which matches what I could get elsewhere. This is already at my absolute minimum threshold since the product is worth at least that much to me. Can you meet me at this price?",15000.0,Alice,5,
