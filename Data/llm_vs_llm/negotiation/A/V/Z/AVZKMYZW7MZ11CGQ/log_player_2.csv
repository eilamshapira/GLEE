# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product to offer you. I understand the value of this product and I'm confident in its quality. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's capabilities and market value.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. However, $10000 is too low considering the product's quality and market value. I understand budget concerns, but I need to ensure I receive fair compensation. I have another buyer interested at $15000, but I'd like to work with you. I can reduce my price to $16000, which is a $2000 reduction from my initial offer. This is a competitive price given the product's capabilities.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. I do appreciate your interest in the product. However, $11000 is still below what I can accept for this product. I should mention that I have John willing to purchase it for $15000, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. My lowest acceptable price is $15000, which matches what I could get elsewhere. This is already at my absolute minimum threshold since the product is worth at least that much to me. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

It's clear Alice won't go below $15,000.  It's better to buy from John for $12,000 and save the money."
