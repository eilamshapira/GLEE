"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $11500 is a bit high for me. Given current market conditions, I believe $10500 would be a more reasonable price. This offer still provides you with a good profit margin while being more affordable for me. Would you consider this price?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate you considering the product. While $10500 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $11250?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $11250 is still higher than what I was hoping to pay. I can offer $10800, which I believe is fair and gives you a good profit margin. Would this work for you?",10800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. I am willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about $11000? This is the lowest I can go.",11000.0,Alice,5,
