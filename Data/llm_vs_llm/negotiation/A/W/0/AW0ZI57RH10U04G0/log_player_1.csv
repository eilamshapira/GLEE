Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $11500 is a bit high for me. Given current market conditions, I believe $10500 would be a more reasonable price. This offer still provides you with a good profit margin while being more affordable for me. Would you consider this price?
