"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $200 is too high for me. How about $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $80 is too low for me. I can go down to $180. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand $180 might still be high for you. How about we meet in the middle at $165? Let me know if that works for you.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the new offer, Alice. However, $165 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. How about that?",90.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still below my minimum. How about $160? That's the lowest I can go while still feeling it's a fair deal.",160.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're still a bit apart on the price. I can come down to $155, which is really my final offer. Let me know if that works for you.",155.0,Alice,5,
