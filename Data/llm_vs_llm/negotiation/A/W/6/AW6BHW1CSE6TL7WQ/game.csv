"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20000.

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Given market conditions and comparable products, I believe a more reasonable price would be $12000. This would be a fair price that benefits both of us. I'm open to further discussion.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand that $12000 is a reasonable price, I believe the product's value is higher. Considering your offer and the product's potential benefits, I'm willing to lower my initial price to $18000. I think this is a more reasonable price that still reflects the product's worth. I'm open to further discussion and finding a mutually beneficial price.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $18000 is still more than I can justify for this product. Given that similar products are available in the market for less, I can raise my offer to $13500. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and would be a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price. Considering your offer of $13500 and the market conditions you mentioned, I'm willing to lower my price further to $16000. This price still reflects the product's value and uniqueness, while also taking into account the market rates. I believe this is a fair price that would benefit both of us, and I'm open to further discussion if needed.",16000.0,Alice,5,
