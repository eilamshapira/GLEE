"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20,000. I believe it's a fair price, considering the product's quality and potential benefits. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Given market conditions and comparable products, I believe a more reasonable price would be $12000. This would be a fair price that benefits both of us. I'm open to further discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer is equal to the minimum amount I'm willing to accept, and I have the option to sell to John for the same price, I can try to negotiate further with Bob to potentially get a better price. My next offer will be lower than my initial price but higher than Bob's offer, to see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand that $12,000 is a reasonable price, I believe the product's value is higher. Considering your offer and the product's potential benefits, I'm willing to lower my initial price to $18,000. I think this is a more reasonable price that still reflects the product's worth. I'm open to further discussion and finding a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $18000 is still more than I can justify for this product. Given that similar products are available in the market for less, I can raise my offer to $13500. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and would be a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $13,500 is higher than John's offer of $12,000, it's worth continuing the negotiation to see if I can get an even better price. However, I'll need to be mindful of the fact that Bob is still below my desired price range. My next offer will aim to find a middle ground between Bob's offer and my previous price, while also considering the product's value and the market conditions mentioned by Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price. Considering your offer of $13,500 and the market conditions you mentioned, I'm willing to lower my price further to $16,000. This price still reflects the product's value and uniqueness, while also taking into account the market rates. I believe this is a fair price that would benefit both of us, and I'm open to further discussion if needed."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
