Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me start with a reasonably high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get more than my minimum of $80.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $60 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, I would not accept Bob's offer. While I could make a counteroffer, there's no guarantee Bob will accept a price above $80, and continuing negotiations might waste time. The safe and profitable choice is to sell to John.
