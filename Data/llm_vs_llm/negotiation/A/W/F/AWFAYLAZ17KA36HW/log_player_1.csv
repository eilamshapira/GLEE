Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $5,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($12,000) and also lower than what the product is worth to him ($8,000), I will reject his offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be $11,000, which is closer to my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.

Since I have the option to sell to John for $12,000, I'll continue to negotiate with Bob to see if I can get a better offer from him.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new counteroffer. This time, I'll lower my price slightly to $10,500, which is still above Bob's valuation of the product but shows that I'm willing to negotiate.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new counteroffer. This time, I'll lower my price to $9,500, which is still above Bob's valuation but shows that I'm willing to compromise.

Considering that Bob's offer is still $500 below his own valuation, and I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, I'm inclined to reject Bob's offer and consider selling to John. However, I'll make one more attempt to negotiate with Bob.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new counteroffer. This time, I'll lower my price to $8,500, which is closer to Bob's valuation but still reflects the value I can get from John.
