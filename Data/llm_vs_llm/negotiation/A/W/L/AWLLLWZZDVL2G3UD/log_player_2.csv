"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $20,000 because it's higher than my maximum value of $15,000 and also higher than John's price. It wouldn't make sense to accept a price that's $5,000 more than my alternative option. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm offering $12,000, which is significantly lower than John's price of $15,000. This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to save money compared to my alternative option. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate upward, but starting low gives me the best chance to reach a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $18,000 as it's still higher than both my maximum value ($15,000) and John's price ($15,000). There's no reason to accept a price that's $3,000 more than my alternative option. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, perhaps meeting somewhere in the middle between my previous offer and John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm increasing my offer to $13,500, which is $1,500 below John's price. This shows willingness to negotiate upward from my previous offer while still maintaining potential savings compared to my alternative option. It's a reasonable middle ground that could be attractive to Alice while still giving me a good deal if accepted."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $15,000. Alice's offers have consistently remained above my maximum value ($15,000), and even after multiple rounds of negotiation, she hasn't come down to a price that would be better than John's offer. While we could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will drop her price below $15,000, and we're already halfway through our available rounds. It's most rational to take the guaranteed $15,000 price from John rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome."
