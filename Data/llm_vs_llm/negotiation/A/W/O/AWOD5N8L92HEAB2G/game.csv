"Bob, I'm excited to begin negotiations. I believe this product will be a valuable asset to you. To start, I'm offering it for $1550000.",1550000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $1550000 is far above what I can pay for this product. The product is only worth $800000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for that amount. To be honest, I'd prefer to work with you, but I need a price that makes sense for my business. I can offer you $650000, which would allow me to justify choosing you over the alternative.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but my bottom line is $1200000. While $1550000 was an initial offer, I am willing to come down. How about we meet in the middle of what the product is worth to you and what it's worth to me? I can offer it to you for $1400000. This is a significant reduction and I hope you will consider it.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1400000 is still well above what makes financial sense for me. You mentioned your bottom line is $1200000, but the product is only worth $800000 to me. I have John's offer at $800000, so paying more than that would put me at a loss. I can raise my offer to $750000, which is close to my absolute maximum while still giving me a small buffer. This is substantially better than my initial offer and acknowledges your need to make this worthwhile for you too.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $800000 is your perceived value, but selling below $1200000 would be a loss for me. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial point. I'm willing to come down further, but I need to see more movement from your side. How about $1300000? This is a further significant drop from my side. I believe that if you think hard you could find a way for this product to be worth a little more to you.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
