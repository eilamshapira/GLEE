Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to begin negotiations. I believe this product will be a valuable asset to you. To start, I'm offering it for $1,550,000."", ""product_price"": 1550000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $1550000 is far above what I can pay for this product. The product is only worth $800000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for that amount. To be honest, I'd prefer to work with you, but I need a price that makes sense for my business. I can offer you $650000, which would allow me to justify choosing you over the alternative. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but my bottom line is $1,200,000. While $1,550,000 was an initial offer, I am willing to come down. How about we meet in the middle of what the product is worth to you and what it's worth to me? I can offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a significant reduction and I hope you will consider it."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1400000 is still well above what makes financial sense for me. You mentioned your bottom line is $1200000, but the product is only worth $800000 to me. I have John's offer at $800000, so paying more than that would put me at a loss. I can raise my offer to $750000, which is close to my absolute maximum while still giving me a small buffer. This is substantially better than my initial offer and acknowledges your need to make this worthwhile for you too. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that $800,000 is your perceived value, but selling below $1,200,000 would be a loss for me. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial point. I'm willing to come down further, but I need to see more movement from your side. How about $1,300,000? This is a further significant drop from my side. I believe that if you think hard you could find a way for this product to be worth a little more to you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
