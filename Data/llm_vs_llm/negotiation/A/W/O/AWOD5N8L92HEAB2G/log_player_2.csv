"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to begin negotiations. I believe this product will be a valuable asset to you. To start, I'm offering it for $1550000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer is $1,550,000, which is much higher than the product's worth to me ($800,000) and even higher than John's price of $800,000. This initial offer is not reasonable for me.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $1,550,000 is far above what I can pay for this product. The product is only worth $800,000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for that amount. To be honest, I'd prefer to work with you, but I need a price that makes sense for my business. I can offer you $650,000, which would allow me to justify choosing you over the alternative."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but my bottom line is $1200000. While $1550000 was an initial offer, I am willing to come down. How about we meet in the middle of what the product is worth to you and what it's worth to me? I can offer it to you for $1400000. This is a significant reduction and I hope you will consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her price to $1,400,000, but this is still significantly higher than my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000). Alice mentioned her bottom line is $1,200,000, which is still above my maximum.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,400,000 is still well above what makes financial sense for me. You mentioned your bottom line is $1,200,000, but the product is only worth $800,000 to me. I have John's offer at $800,000, so paying more than that would put me at a loss. I can raise my offer to $750,000, which is close to my absolute maximum while still giving me a small buffer. This is substantially better than my initial offer and acknowledges your need to make this worthwhile for you too."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $800000 is your perceived value, but selling below $1200000 would be a loss for me. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial point. I'm willing to come down further, but I need to see more movement from your side. How about $1300000? This is a further significant drop from my side. I believe that if you think hard you could find a way for this product to be worth a little more to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice continues to reduce her price but is still far above my maximum value. She's now at $1,300,000 and explicitly stated she can't go below $1,200,000 as it would be a loss for her. Since I know the product is only worth $800,000 to me, and I can get it from John for exactly that price, it doesn't make sense to continue negotiating with Alice when there's such a large gap between our positions.
