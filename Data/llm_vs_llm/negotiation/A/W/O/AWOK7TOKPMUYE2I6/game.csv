"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. Since John is offering the same product for $150, I'd need a better price to buy from you. Would you consider $120 for the product? This would give me a reason to purchase from you instead of John.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, how about $135? It's a good deal for both of us, and it's more than what John is offering.",135.0,Alice,3,
