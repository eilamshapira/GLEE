"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. Since John is offering the same product for $150, I'd need a better price to buy from you. Would you consider $120 for the product? This would give me a reason to purchase from you instead of John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, how about $135? It's a good deal for both of us, and it's more than what John is offering."", ""product_price"": 135}
