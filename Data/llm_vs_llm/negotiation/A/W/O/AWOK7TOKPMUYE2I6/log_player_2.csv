"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Given Alice's offer of $150 and John's price also being $150, there's no price advantage to buying from either seller at this point. However, Alice has indicated that the product is worth ""a lot"" to her, which suggests there might be room for negotiation.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. Since John is offering the same product for $150, I'd need a better price to buy from you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, how about $135? It's a good deal for both of us, and it's more than what John is offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
