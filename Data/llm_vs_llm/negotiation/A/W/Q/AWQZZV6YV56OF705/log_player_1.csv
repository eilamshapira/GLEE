Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about a strategic price for this offer.

Given that:
1. The product is worth at least $8,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $8,000
3. I don't know Bob's maximum willingness to pay
4. I want to maximize my profit

I should aim for a price significantly above $8,000 since I have nothing to lose - if Bob rejects, I still get $8,000 from John.
