"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to make a decision based on the information given:

- The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
- Alice's offer is $15,000
- John is selling the same product for $12,000

Since Alice's offer exceeds what the product is worth to me ($12,000), and John is offering exactly what the product is worth to me, the rational choice is to buy from John.
