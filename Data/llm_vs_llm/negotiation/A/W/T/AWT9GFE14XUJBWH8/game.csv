"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value and rarity of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm glad you recognize its value. However, I must say that $9000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, considering the product's worth to me. I'm willing to make a compromise and meet you halfway between my initial offer and your proposal. I'm offering the product to you for $13500. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. Considering the product's worth to me, I'm willing to increase my initial offer to $10500. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your proposal, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I still believe that $10500 is a bit lower than the product's true value. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $12500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",12500.0,Alice,5,
