It's best to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  While $13,500 isn't a terrible price, there's room to work down from Alice's starting offer."

This offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation while being a good deal for me."

Alice has come down significantly, and this price is within a reasonable range of my target.  It's better to accept now rather than risk the negotiation stalling out and losing the opportunity for a good price."
