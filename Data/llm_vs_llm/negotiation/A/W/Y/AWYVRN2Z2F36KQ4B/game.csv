"Alice, $5000000 is a bit out of my range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $800000 is below my minimum threshold for this product. I'm willing to come down to $4000000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to lower my offer to $3500000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. What are your thoughts?",3500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $3500000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, but I need to stay within that range. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet in the middle, and I appreciate that. However, $1500000 is still below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down further to $3000000. This is a substantial offer, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $2500000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1800000, but I need to stay within that range. It seems like we are both willing to compromise, let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1800000.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle. However, $1800000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to lower my offer to $2200000. This is my final significant reduction, and I hope we can agree on this price.",,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but I need to stick to a price that reflects the value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $2000000. This is my best and final offer. Let me know if this works for you.",2000000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2000000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $1900000, but I need to stay within that range. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.",1900000.0,Bob,8,
