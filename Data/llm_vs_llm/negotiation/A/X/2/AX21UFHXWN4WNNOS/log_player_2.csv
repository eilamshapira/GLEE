"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offer is $140
2. The product is worth $80 to Alice
3. I have a maximum value of $150 for the product
4. John's fixed price is $150

Alice's offer of $140 is better than John's price ($150), but given that the product is worth $80 to Alice, there's significant room for negotiation. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as Alice has substantial margin to lower the price while still making a profit.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $80 to Alice and $150 is my maximum value, I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's $140 but still gives her a reasonable profit. I'll start with $100, which would give Alice a $20 profit while saving me $50 compared to John's price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has lowered her price from $140 to $130, showing she's willing to negotiate. However, since the product costs her $80, there's still room for a better price. The $130 is significantly better than John's $150, but I believe we can still negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down from $140 to $130, showing some flexibility, and rejected my previous offer of $100, I'll increase my previous offer but still try to get a good deal. I'll offer $110, which would give Alice a $30 profit while still saving me a significant amount compared to her current offer and John's price.

{""product_price"": 110}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has shown consistent willingness to negotiate, dropping from $140 to $130 to $125. While there might still be room for negotiation, $125 is a reasonable price considering:
1. It's $25 less than John's price
2. Alice has moved down $15 in total
3. Further negotiation might risk Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate
4. The price gives Alice a fair profit while giving me a good discount compared to my maximum value

At this point, accepting the offer seems like the best decision to secure a good deal.
