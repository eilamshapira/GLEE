"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $10,000, Alice's offer of $15,000 is not reasonable. Buying from Alice at this price would result in a $5,000 loss compared to my maximum valuation.
