"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will greatly benefit you. I am offering it to you for $15000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Looking at the situation:

- Alice is offering to sell me the product for $15,000
- The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $15,000

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price of $15,000, and this matches my maximum valuation, I'm indifferent between the two options. There's no cost advantage to either choice.
