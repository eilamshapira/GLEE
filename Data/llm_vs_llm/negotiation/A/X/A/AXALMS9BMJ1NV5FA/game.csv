"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the initial price. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1900000. This reflects a significant adjustment on my part while acknowledging the true value of [product name].  Let me know your thoughts.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1900000 is still far outside my budget. I can offer $700000, and that's really my maximum. I have another option available to me for $800000 so I need to stay within a reasonable range.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I'm aiming for a deal that benefits us both. How about we meet halfway at $1300000? This acknowledges the gap between our initial positions while recognizing the value [product name] offers. It's my final offer, as I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
