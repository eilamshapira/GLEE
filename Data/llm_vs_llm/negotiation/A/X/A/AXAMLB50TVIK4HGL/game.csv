"Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my premium product. Given its exceptional quality and the market demand, I'm confident that it's worth $14000. However, I'm willing to let it go for $13000 for you.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the quality of your product, but $13000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay a reasonable price, considering the market value and my own needs.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand that you have a budget to maintain. However, I believe that the price you're offering is significantly lower than the product's value. I'm willing to lower my initial offer to $11500. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market demand.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I understand that $9000 was a bit low, but $11500 is still higher than I'm comfortable paying. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to propose $10250 as a fair compromise.",10250.0,Bob,4,
