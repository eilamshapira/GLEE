Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, I am looking to make a more reasonable investment. Would you consider a counteroffer of $1200000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is the minimum value I have for the product, and I also have the option to sell it to John for the same price, I don't see a benefit in rejecting Bob's offer and risking not getting a better deal in the next round. Therefore, I will accept Bob's offer.
