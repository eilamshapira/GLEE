"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $19000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'd be happy to start with $10000. ",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $10000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $15000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value this product brings.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $15000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12500?  This would be a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",12500.0,Bob,4,
