"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer against the alternative:

- Alice's offer: $1,150,000
- John's offer: $1,200,000
- My maximum valuation: $1,200,000

Alice's offer is $50,000 cheaper than John's offer. Since I want to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is below my maximum valuation, I should accept Alice's offer.
