"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. Although I'm interested in the product, $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000, considering the market value and my own financial constraints. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate you being upfront. While $10000 is lower than I can accept, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $22000?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $22000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm trying to balance my budget, and I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the market. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $19000? This is the lowest I can realistically go.",19000.0,Alice,5,
