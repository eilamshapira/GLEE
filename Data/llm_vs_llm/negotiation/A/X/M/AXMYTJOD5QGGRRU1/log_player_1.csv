Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer to Bob for my product. I know that:
- The product is worth at least $150 to me
- If Bob rejects, I can sell it to John for $150
- I don't know how much Bob values the product

Since I have a guaranteed fallback of $150 from John, I should set my price higher than that to maximize my potential profit. However, I don't want to set it too high and risk Bob rejecting it. A reasonable approach would be to set a moderately higher price that gives Bob a reason to accept while still giving me a good profit margin.
