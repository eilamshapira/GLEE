"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $20000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $12000 for it, given its condition and my current financial situation. Let me know if you're open to discussing this price.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $18000, considering its exceptional features and the value it can bring. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'd like to meet somewhere in the middle. Let me know if $18000 is something you'd be willing to consider.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $18000 is still outside my budget. Would you be willing to consider $15000?  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above $15000. I'd be willing to consider $17000 as a compromise. This price takes into account the product's value and your budget constraints. Let me know if $17000 is something you'd be willing to accept.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're making progress, but I'm still a bit too high at $17000. I'm willing to go up to $16000.  If you're willing to come down a bit more, we can close this deal. Let me know if you're open to this offer.",16000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I think we're getting close to a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $17000 and $16000. Let's consider $16500 as a compromise. This price reflects the product's value and our negotiations so far. Let me know if $16500 works for you.",16500.0,Alice,7,
