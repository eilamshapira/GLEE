"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited about the prospect of you acquiring this incredible product. Given its unique features and the value it will bring to your business, I'm offering it to you for $1600000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she's asking for $1,600,000 for the product. This is significantly higher than the maximum value of $1,200,000 that the product is worth to me. It's also higher than John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000.

Since Alice's price is above both my maximum valuation and John's alternative offer, there's no reason to accept or continue negotiating.
