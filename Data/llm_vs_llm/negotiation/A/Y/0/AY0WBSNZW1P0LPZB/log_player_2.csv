"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to consider whether Alice's offer is reasonable given what the product is worth to me.

Alice is offering the product for $14,000, but it's only worth up to $8,000 to me. This offer is significantly above my maximum valuation, and I can get the same product from John for exactly $8,000.

Since Alice's initial offer is much higher than my valuation and the alternative option, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives us room to negotiate while acknowledging the large gap between Alice's initial offer and my valuation.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price from $14,000 to $12,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still above the $8,000 maximum value to me and above John's fixed price of $8,000.

Since I can get the product from John for $8,000, and Alice's current offer is $12,000, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but will keep it under my maximum value.

Since I can get the same product from John for $8,000, there's no reason for me to accept Alice's offer of $11,000. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

Since I can get the same product from John for $8,000, there's no reason for me to pay $10,000 to Alice. I'll reject this offer and make one more counteroffer, but we're getting closer to the point where I should consider taking John's offer.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I need to be clearer that I have a firm alternative at $8,000, so I'll make my final serious offer at that price.

Since I can get the same product from John for $8,000, and Alice's current offer is $9,000, I'll choose to buy from John instead. This is the most economical choice given my maximum valuation of $8,000.
