(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's offer of $145 is quite close to the maximum price of $150 that the product is worth to me. However, I can try to negotiate a better price with Alice before considering John's fixed price of $150.
