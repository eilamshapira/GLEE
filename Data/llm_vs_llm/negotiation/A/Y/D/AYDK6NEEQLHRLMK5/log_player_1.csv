"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Given that Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly higher than John's fixed offer of $800,000, and it's only round 2, I'll reject this offer and make a counter-offer. While $900,000 is reasonable, there might be room to negotiate for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still aim for a price significantly higher than Bob's last offer.

{""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob has increased his offer to $950,000, which is a good improvement from his previous offer of $900,000. While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk that prolonged negotiations might lead to Bob losing interest. This offer is significantly better than John's $800,000, and it's a good profit margin. I'll accept this offer.
