"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. Based on the quality and features of this product, I'm offering it to you for $18000. This is a premium item that provides excellent value for the investment. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on this offer.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18000 is much higher than I expected. I'm willing to purchase the product for $8000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I can't accept $8000 as that's below my minimum threshold. This product is worth at least $10000 to me, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. Given the quality and value of this product, I can come down to $16000, which I believe is still a fair price for what you're getting. Would you consider this adjusted offer?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $16000 is still quite high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9000.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but $9000 is still below what I can accept. As I mentioned, I have another buyer ready to pay $10000 for this product. If you can offer $14000, we can close this deal today. This product delivers exceptional value and performance that justifies this price point. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $14000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $10000.",10000.0,Bob,6,
