Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I can't accept $8000 as that's below my minimum threshold. This product is worth at least $10000 to me, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. Given the quality and value of this product, I can come down to $16000, which I believe is still a fair price for what you're getting. Would you consider this adjusted offer?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
