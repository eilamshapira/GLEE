"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I'm looking to sell. I value it at no less than $100. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's initial offer is $150, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I don't want to accept it immediately without trying to negotiate a better price. I also don't want to buy from John yet, as I'd like to see if I can get a better deal from Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since Alice mentioned she values the product at no less than $100, I'll try to split the difference between $100 and $150.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after some consideration, I'm willing to lower my price. Would you be able to meet me in the middle at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","It seems like there's a discrepancy in Alice's message and offer. She mentions meeting in the middle at $135, but her actual offer is $140. I'll assume she meant to say $140, as that's the official offer.

Since $140 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, and I've only used 2 rounds so far, I'll try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to meet Alice closer to the middle of our previous discussions. Since Alice's last offer was $140, and I previously offered $125, I'll try to split the difference between those two prices.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for lowering your price. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $132.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 132.50}"
