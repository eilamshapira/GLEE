"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $20000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The price Alice is offering is $20,000, which is significantly higher than the maximum value of $8,000 that the product is worth to me. Additionally, I know I can buy the same product from John for exactly $8,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this high price, and there's also no need to continue negotiating when I already have a guaranteed option at the maximum I'm willing to pay.
