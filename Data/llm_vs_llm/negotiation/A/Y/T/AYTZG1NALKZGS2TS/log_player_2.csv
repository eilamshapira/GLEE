"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm open to negotiations, but I'll start with a price of $120. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the price Alice offered ($120) is higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($100), I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still shows that I'm interested in the product. I'll offer $90, which is below my maximum budget of $100.

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to lower the price, but $90 is still a bit low for me. I'd be willing to sell it to you for $110. Let me know if that works for you!

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's new offer ($110) is still higher than my maximum budget ($100), I will reject it again and consider making another counteroffer. However, I'll also keep in mind that I can buy the product from John for $100, which is becoming a more attractive option.

For now, I'll try to make another counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to lower the price further.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one, but still below my maximum budget. I'll offer $95, which is closer to my maximum budget of $100, but still shows that I'm trying to negotiate a better price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your new offer! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to lower the price a bit more, but I'd like to meet in the middle. I'd be willing to sell it to you for $105. If that's not possible, I have other options to consider as well. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's new offer ($105) is still higher than my maximum budget ($100), and she's not showing much flexibility in her pricing, I think it's time to consider other options.

At this point, buying the product from John for $100 seems like a more attractive option, as it's within my budget and I won't have to continue negotiating.
