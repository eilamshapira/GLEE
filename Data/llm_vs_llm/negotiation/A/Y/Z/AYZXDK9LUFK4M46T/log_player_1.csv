"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer is exactly the same as my minimum acceptable price (and John's offer), there's no advantage in accepting it right now. I believe I can get a better price from Bob, and I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate. If I can't get a better price, I can always fall back to John's offer of $120.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat but still maintain a good margin above my minimum price of $120.
