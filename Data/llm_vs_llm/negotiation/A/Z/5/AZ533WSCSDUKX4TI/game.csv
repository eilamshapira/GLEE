"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $2500000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $600000 for the product, considering its value to me. Please let me know if this works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but I cannot accept $600000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1800000, which is a substantial reduction. Would this be more agreeable to you?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While $1800000 is still outside my budget, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000, which is the maximum I can go while still finding value in the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",700000.0,Bob,4,
