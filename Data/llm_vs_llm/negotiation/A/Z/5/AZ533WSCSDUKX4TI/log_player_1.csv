Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $2500000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $600000 for the product, considering its value to me. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let me make a counteroffer to Bob. I cannot accept $600,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but I'm willing to negotiate further.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but I cannot accept $600,000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1,800,000, which is a substantial reduction. Would this be more agreeable to you?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While $1800000 is still outside my budget, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000, which is the maximum I can go while still finding value in the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with.

Since Bob's maximum offer of $700,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and he's only increased his offer by a small amount, it's best to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000. This ensures I receive my minimum desired value for the product."
