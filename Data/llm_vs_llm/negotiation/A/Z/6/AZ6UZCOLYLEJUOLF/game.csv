"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm afraid I couldn't go as low as $80. I'm willing to negotiate, though. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I think that's a fair price, considering the product's value.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the reduction to $140, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $90. I believe it's a reasonable offer, considering I can get a similar product from John for $100. Would you be willing to consider my offer?",90.0,Bob,4,
