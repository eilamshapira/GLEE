Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150 and also lower than what I know John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm afraid I couldn't go as low as $80. I'm willing to negotiate, though. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I think that's a fair price, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the reduction to $140, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $90. I believe it's a reasonable offer, considering I can get a similar product from John for $100. Would you be willing to consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $90 is still lower than my minimum price and also lower than what I know John is willing to pay, and considering that Bob mentioned he can get a similar product from John for $100, which is closer to my target but still not what I'm aiming for, I will reject Bob's offer. Given that I have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, I see no reason to continue negotiating at prices below my minimum acceptable value.
