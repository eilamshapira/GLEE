Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","I will reject Bob's offer of $6,000 as it is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Since I can guarantee $10,000 from John, there's no reason to accept anything lower than that from Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

For my next counteroffer, I'll propose $15,000, which is lower than my initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation while maintaining a good profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $10,000, and we've already had multiple rounds of negotiation without getting close to a price above $10,000, it would be most profitable to sell to John at this point.
