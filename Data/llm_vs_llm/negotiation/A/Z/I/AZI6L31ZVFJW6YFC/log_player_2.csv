"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm offering it to you for $14999. This product is in high demand, and I have another buyer willing to pay top dollar. Don't miss out on this opportunity! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $10,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $14,999
3. John is willing to sell it for $10,000
4. Alice is using pressure tactics mentioning ""high demand"" and ""another buyer""

Since:
- Alice's price ($14,999) is significantly higher than the product's value to me ($10,000)
- John's offer ($10,000) matches the maximum I'm willing to pay
- Alice's price is also much higher than John's alternative
- There's no advantage in accepting Alice's inflated price

The logical choice is to buy from John.
