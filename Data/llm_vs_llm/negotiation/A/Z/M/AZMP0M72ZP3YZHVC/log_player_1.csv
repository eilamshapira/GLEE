Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that my initial price was a bit high, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $1300000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $1200000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

I'll make another counteroffer, trying to get closer to a mutually beneficial price. Since Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000 and I initially offered $1,300,000, and considering the product's value to him is $1,500,000, I'll try to find a middle ground that is still favorable to me. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer of $1,250,000, which is a compromise between Bob's offer and my previous counteroffer."

I'll make another counteroffer. Since Bob is willing to pay $1,225,000, which is very close to my previous offer of $1,250,000, I'll try to find a price that is slightly lower than my previous offer but still higher than Bob's current offer.

Bob's latest offer of $1,230,000 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $1,237,500. Considering we're running out of rounds and I want to ensure the sale, I'm willing to accept this offer. It's a good price, and I'm confident that it's a fair deal for both parties. Accepting this offer will also avoid the risk of Bob walking away or me having to sell to John for $1,000,000."
