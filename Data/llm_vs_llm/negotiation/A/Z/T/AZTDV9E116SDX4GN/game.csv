"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its value.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $200 is more than I can justify spending. The product is actually only worth $150 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for exactly $150. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a better price. Would you consider $120? This would save me some money compared to my alternative option and still provide you with a sale.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you have an alternative option, but I believe my product is worth more than $120. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I need to get at least $180 for it. Let me know if this works for you.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $180 is still more than I can justify spending when I know I can get the same product from John for $150. The product is only worth $150 to me, so paying more wouldn't make financial sense. I'd still prefer to do business with you, so I can offer $130. This would be a better deal for me than going with John, and you'd still make a sale. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to work with me. I understand that $180 might be out of your budget, but I'm trying to find a balance between what you're willing to pay and what I need to get for the product. I can offer $160, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me on the price. I appreciate that you've come down to $160, which is much closer to what makes sense for me. However, since I can get the same product from John for $150, and that's exactly what the product is worth to me, I can't justify paying more than that. I'd still prefer to do business with you, so I can offer you $140, which is better for me than John's offer, but still gives you a sale. Is that something you could consider?",140.0,Bob,6,
