Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $200 is more than I can justify spending. The product is actually only worth $150 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for exactly $150. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a better price. Would you consider $120? This would save me some money compared to my alternative option and still provide you with a sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $120 is lower than I'm willing to accept. My counteroffer will be $180. This is still a premium price, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and work with him. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you have an alternative option, but I believe my product is worth more than $120. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I need to get at least $180 for it. Let me know if this works for you.""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $180 is still more than I can justify spending when I know I can get the same product from John for $150. The product is only worth $150 to me, so paying more wouldn't make financial sense. I'd still prefer to do business with you, so I can offer $130. This would be a better deal for me than going with John, and you'd still make a sale. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as $130 is still lower than I'm willing to accept. Since Bob's maximum willingness to pay is $150, I'll try to meet him in the middle. My counteroffer will be $160. This shows I'm willing to continue negotiating and find a mutually beneficial price.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to work with me. I understand that $180 might be out of your budget, but I'm trying to find a balance between what you're willing to pay and what I need to get for the product. I can offer $160, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 160}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me on the price. I appreciate that you've come down to $160, which is much closer to what makes sense for me. However, since I can get the same product from John for $150, and that's exactly what the product is worth to me, I can't justify paying more than that. I'd still prefer to do business with you, so I can offer you $140, which is better for me than John's offer, but still gives you a sale. Is that something you could consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob's offers keep getting closer to $150, but he's unwilling to meet me at a price that I'm comfortable with, and I have the option to sell the product to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price, I've decided to end the negotiation with Bob and sell the product to John for $150. This ensures I get the price I want without further prolonging the negotiation."
