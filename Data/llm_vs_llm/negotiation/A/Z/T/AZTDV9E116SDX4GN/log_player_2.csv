"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully. She's offering the product for $200, but it's only worth $150 to me, and I know I can get it from John for exactly $150.

Since Alice's price is higher than both my maximum value and John's alternative price, this is not a good deal for me.

The product is actually only worth $150 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for exactly $150. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a better price. Would you consider $120? This would save me some money compared to my alternative option and still provide you with a sale."", ""product_price"": 120}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you have an alternative option, but I believe my product is worth more than $120. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I need to get at least $180 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has reduced her price from $200 to $180, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $180 is still more than the $150 the product is worth to me, and still more than John's price of $150.

Since I can get the same product from John for $150, and that matches exactly what the product is worth to me, it doesn't make sense to pay Alice $180.

However, $180 is still more than I can justify spending when I know I can get the same product from John for $150. The product is only worth $150 to me, so paying more wouldn't make financial sense.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to work with me. I understand that $180 might be out of your budget, but I'm trying to find a balance between what you're willing to pay and what I need to get for the product. I can offer $160, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.

Since I can get the same product from John for $150, and that matches exactly what the product is worth to me, it doesn't make sense to pay Alice $160.
