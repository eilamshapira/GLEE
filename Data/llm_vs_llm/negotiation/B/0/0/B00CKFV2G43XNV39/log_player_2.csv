"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision that maximizes my value.

The product is worth no more than $80 to me. Alice is offering to sell it for $150, which exceeds its value to me. Meanwhile, John is offering to sell the same product for $80, which matches the maximum I'm willing to pay.

Since Alice's price ($150) is significantly higher than John's price ($80), and John's price exactly matches my maximum valuation, the rational choice is to buy from John.
