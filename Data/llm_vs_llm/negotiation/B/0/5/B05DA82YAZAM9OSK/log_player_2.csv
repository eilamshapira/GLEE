"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering my premium product to you for a fantastic price of $1200000. This product is in high demand, and I know it will be a great asset to you. If you're interested, please let me know at your earliest convenience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's significantly higher than Alice's valuation of the product. There's a good chance you could get a better price by negotiating or waiting for a counter-offer.  You're willing to walk away and buy from John at $1,500,000, so you have some leverage."
