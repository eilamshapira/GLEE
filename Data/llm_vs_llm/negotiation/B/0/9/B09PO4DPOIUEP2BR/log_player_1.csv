Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $145 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

I could sell to John for $120, which is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. $125 is better than $120. However, I want to try one more counteroffer to get closer to my original price, and avoid selling it to John.
