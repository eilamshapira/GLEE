"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $800000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $800000 is below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we settle at $1000000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. Let's meet in the middle. How about $950000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and should be within a reasonable range for you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price. However, $950000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm close to meeting you at your price, but I need a bit more. How about we settle at $925000? This is my final offer before considering other options.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to come down to $925000, which is a very competitive price for the value this product offers. Let's finalize this at $925000.",925000.0,Alice,5,
