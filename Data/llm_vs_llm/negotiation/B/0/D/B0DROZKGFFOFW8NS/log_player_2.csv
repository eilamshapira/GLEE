"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the offer of $1,200,000 is above my budget of $1,000,000, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. This will give us room to negotiate and potentially find a mutually acceptable price.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. Let's meet in the middle. How about $950000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and should be within a reasonable range for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $950,000 is still slightly above my target budget of $1,000,000, but it's getting closer. Since I have 8 rounds left to negotiate, I'll try to see if I can get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll respond to Alice's offer by making a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one, but still lower than Alice's current offer. This will show that I'm willing to compromise and meet Alice halfway.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price. However, $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to come down to $925000, which is a very competitive price for the value this product offers. Let's finalize this at $925000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $925,000 is very close to my maximum budget of $1,000,000, and it's a significant reduction from her initial offer. Considering I've already had a few rounds of negotiation, I think it's likely that Alice has made a serious concession. Since the difference between Alice's offer and my maximum budget is relatively small ($75,000), I'll accept Alice's offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation not yielding a better result.
