"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Knowing it's worth $10000 to you, I'm starting the negotiation at a fair price. Let's start at the price of the product being $9500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. The product is really interesting, but I'm looking to save some money. How about $8500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counter, Bob. I understand you're looking to save, but $8500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? That's a solid discount from its value to you, and still works for me.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to go up to $8700. What do you say?",8700.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $8700 is getting closer, but I'm firm on the value. Let's try $8900. It's a small increase, and a significant discount for you, given the product's $10000 value.",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to get a good deal, but $8900 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $8600? It's a fair price considering my budget.",8600.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're so close! I can't go as low as $8600. My bottom line is $8800. That's the lowest I can go while still making it worthwhile for me. What do you say?",8800.0,Alice,7,
