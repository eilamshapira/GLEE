"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $15,000 to me (my minimum price) and $10,000 to Bob, I'll start with a high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum price.

{""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $15,000, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Bob if he's starting this low.
