"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to be transparent that $250 is well above what I'm looking to spend. I can get the same product from another seller for $150. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $120 for the product, which gives you a quick sale without me having to go elsewhere. Let me know if that works for you.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I can't accept $120 as it's below my minimum. I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay $150, which is the absolute minimum I can accept for this product based on its value and my costs. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer it to you for $180, which is still a significant reduction from my initial price. Let me know if this works for you.",180.0,Alice,3,
