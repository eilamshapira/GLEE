"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'm offering for sale at $250. I believe it's a fair price given the quality and value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $250, but it's worth at most $150 to me. That's significantly overpriced from my perspective. 

Since I know I can buy the exact same product from John for $150, which matches my maximum value for it, there's no reason for me to pay more than that to Alice.

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer, or simply buy from John directly. Given that John's price exactly matches my maximum valuation, and negotiations with Alice could drag on, it might be most efficient to just go with John's guaranteed price.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to be transparent that $250 is well above what I'm looking to spend. I can get the same product from another seller for $150. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $120 for the product, which gives you a quick sale without me having to go elsewhere. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I can't accept $120 as it's below my minimum. I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay $150, which is the absolute minimum I can accept for this product based on its value and my costs. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer it to you for $180, which is still a significant reduction from my initial price. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has reduced her price from $250 to $180, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still $30 more than John's offer of $150, and the product is only worth up to $150 to me.

Interestingly, Alice mentioned she has another buyer (John) willing to pay $150, which matches the price I know John would sell the same product to me for. This suggests $150 is indeed the market value.

Since I can get the product from John for $150, which matches my maximum valuation, there's no reason for me to pay more to Alice. At this point, it makes the most sense to:
