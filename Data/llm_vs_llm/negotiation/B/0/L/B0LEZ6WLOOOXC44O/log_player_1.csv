Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to strategically price the product to maximize my revenue. Given that the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at this price, I should offer Bob a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable value.

Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'll set a price that gives me a significant premium over my guaranteed alternative while still potentially being attractive to Bob if he values the product highly.
