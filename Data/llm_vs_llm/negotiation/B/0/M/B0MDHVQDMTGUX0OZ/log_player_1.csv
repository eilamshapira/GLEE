"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm very excited to offer you this incredible product. Based on its value and your interest, I'm willing to let it go for $20,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $20000 is beyond my budget. I value the product at $8000. Would you consider selling it for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Okay, this is a tough spot. Bob's valuation is significantly lower than mine, and his offer is below what the product is worth to me. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand you have a certain budget, but I can't go that low. Given the product's value, I'm willing to meet you in the middle a bit. How about $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, Alice. However, my budget is tight, and I can't go much higher. Would you consider $10000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","This is getting closer to the point where I have to consider other options. $10,000 is still below what the product is worth to me, but the gap is closing. I'll reject Bob's offer one more time, but I'll need to be more realistic in my next counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob. I'm lowering my price significantly this round.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I truly appreciate your efforts to find a price we can both agree on. However, $12000 is the maximum I can do, as it's the price offered by another seller. Could we agree on that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","This is it. Bob is offering me exactly what John is offering. At this point, I have to make a decision based on time and risk. Selling to John avoids any further negotiation and guarantees a sale. It also removes the chance of making more money with Bob. Given the limited rounds and the fact that I am making the minimum the product is worth to me, I will choose to sell to John, avoiding any risk of losing the sale, or ending up with less.
