"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $2,000,000 is way above my maximum value of $800,000, and it's also significantly higher than John's price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I always have the option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 600000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $600,000. This is below John's price of $800,000, which gives me room to negotiate upward if necessary. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, there might be a possibility to find a middle ground that works for both of us. However, if Alice doesn't come down significantly from her initial $2,000,000 offer, I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,800,000 is still significantly above my maximum value of $800,000. While she did reduce the price from her initial offer, the reduction is not nearly enough to make it attractive compared to John's offer of $800,000. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. If Alice doesn't come down to a more reasonable price soon, it would make more sense to take John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'll increase my previous offer to $700,000. This is still below John's price but shows some movement toward meeting Alice in the middle. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, there could still be room for negotiation that benefits both parties. However, I'm keeping my offer below John's price of $800,000 since that's my best alternative and absolute maximum value. If Alice doesn't come down substantially in her next counter, I'll likely need to consider taking John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John for $800,000. Here's why:

1. Alice's latest offer of $1,500,000 is still significantly above my maximum value of $800,000
2. While Alice has been coming down in price ($2M → $1.8M → $1.5M), the rate of decrease suggests we're unlikely to reach a price below $800,000 in the remaining rounds
3. The $1,500,000 offer matches Alice's own value for the product, suggesting she's unlikely to go much lower
4. John's offer of $800,000 is exactly at my maximum value
5. We've already used half of our negotiation rounds, and the gap is still too large

Given these factors, it's most rational to take the guaranteed offer from John rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to result in a better deal."
