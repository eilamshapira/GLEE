Send your offer to Bob.,"Given this situation, I should carefully consider my pricing strategy:

1. The product is worth $12,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer of $15,000 from John
3. Any price above $12,000 will be rejected by Bob
4. Bob's rejection means I get $15,000 from John

Since Bob won't pay more than $12,000 (his maximum value), and I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, it makes more sense to propose a price that Bob will definitely reject. This way, I can secure the higher amount from John.
