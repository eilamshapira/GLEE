# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $20,000 is well beyond my budget. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and I can purchase it from another seller at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your honest offer. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must consider the product's value to me, which is significantly higher than $8500. Given your interest in purchasing from me and the product's quality, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer the product to you for $18000, which is still below my initial price. I believe this is a fair price, considering you mentioned the product is worth $12000 to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $18,000 is still much higher than the product's worth to me ($12,000) and higher than John's price ($12,000). There's no reason to accept this offer either.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, but $18,000 is still well above what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and I can purchase it from another seller at exactly that price. However, I value establishing a business relationship with you. I can offer $9,500 for the product, which is a $1,000 increase from my previous offer. This is significantly below what I could pay elsewhere, giving you incentive to close this deal with me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer and for valuing our potential business relationship. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I still need to consider the product's value to me. Given that you've mentioned the product is worth $12000 to you and you can purchase it from another seller at that price, I'm willing to make a more significant compromise. I can offer the product to you for $15000, which is $3000 below my previous price. This is a serious concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's quality and your interest in purchasing from me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for continuing to work with me on finding a price that works for both of us. I appreciate you coming down to $15,000, which shows good faith. However, I need to be practical about this decision. The product is worth $12,000 to me, and I can buy it from another seller at exactly that price. To make it worthwhile to purchase from you instead, I need a better deal. I'm willing to offer $10,500, which is $1,000 more than my previous offer. This is my best offer given the circumstances. If we can't reach an agreement soon, I'll need to go with the alternative option available to me. How does this sound?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
