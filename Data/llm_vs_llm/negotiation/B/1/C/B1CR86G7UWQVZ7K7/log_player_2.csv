"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you the product at $15000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire it at its true value, and I believe you won’t want to miss out. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's initial offer is at the maximum value I'm willing to pay ($15,000), and I have the option to buy the same product from John for the same price, I see no advantage in accepting Alice's offer immediately without trying to negotiate a better price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in hopes of getting a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable, considering the product's value to me. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a lower price and see how Alice responds.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
