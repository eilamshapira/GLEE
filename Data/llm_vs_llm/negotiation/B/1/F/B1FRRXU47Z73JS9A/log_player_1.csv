Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 (John), any offer to Bob should be higher than $8,000.

However, I don't want to price it too high and risk Bob rejecting it. Without knowing how much the product is worth to Bob, I'll aim for a reasonable markup that gives Bob room to feel he's getting value while maximizing my profit.
