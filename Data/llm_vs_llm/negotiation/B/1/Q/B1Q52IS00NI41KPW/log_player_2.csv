"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,500,000
2. Alice's offer is $1,400,000, which is below my maximum
3. John's fixed price is $1,500,000
4. Alice's cost is $1,200,000, so there's room for negotiation

Alice's current offer of $1,400,000 is lower than John's price ($1,500,000), but I believe there's still room to negotiate for a better price since Alice's cost is $1,200,000. I should try to negotiate for a lower price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's cost is $1,200,000 and her initial offer was $1,400,000, I'll propose a price that's closer to the middle ground between her cost and her initial offer. This gives her room for profit while allowing me to save money.

{""product_price"": 1300000}

This offer gives Alice a $100,000 profit margin while saving me $200,000 compared to her initial offer and $300,000 compared to John's price. It's a reasonable counteroffer that respects both parties' interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $1,400,000 to $1,375,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. The reduction of $25,000 from her previous offer is relatively small
3. There's still a significant margin between her cost ($1,200,000) and this offer
4. The offer is still better than John's price ($1,500,000)
5. We might be able to get a slightly better price, but there's also a risk of Alice becoming less flexible

Given that Alice has shown some flexibility by reducing the price, but the reduction was small, I think there's still room for one more round of negotiation. The risk is acceptable since we always have John's offer as a backup.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has moved down from $1,400,000 to $1,375,000, showing some flexibility. She came down $25,000, so I'll move up from my previous offer of $1,300,000 to show good faith in the negotiation, but still try to get a better deal than her current offer.

{""product_price"": 1325000}

This counteroffer:
1. Shows I'm willing to move up from my initial position
2. Still gives Alice a healthy profit margin ($125,000 above her cost)
3. Would save me $50,000 compared to her current offer
4. Is a reasonable middle ground between our last positions
5. Keeps the negotiation moving in a positive direction while maintaining good potential for savings"
