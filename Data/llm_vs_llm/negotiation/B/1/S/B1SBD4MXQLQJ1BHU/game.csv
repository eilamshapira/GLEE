"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will bring significant value to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to let it go for a price of $17000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. Let me know if you're interested!",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I think $17000 is quite steep for me. I'm willing to pay $6000 for the product. Would you be open to this price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $6000 is too low for me. I'm willing to make a concession, though. I can offer you the product for $14000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $14000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $6500. How does that sound?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for raising your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $6500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $13000. This is a serious compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",13000.0,Alice,5,
