"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point.  It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal. There's no benefit to buying from John right now, as Alice's offer is the same price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's a significant discount from Alice's initial price. I believe this price is reasonable, as it leaves some room for negotiation, but still allows for a substantial profit for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good compromise.  It's below my initial target price but still saves me $500 compared to buying from John.  Given that we are already in Round 3, I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
