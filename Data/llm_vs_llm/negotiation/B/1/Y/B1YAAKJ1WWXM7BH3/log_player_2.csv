"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive product. Given its outstanding quality and the premium experience it delivers, I'm offering it for $15000. Let me know if you'd like to make this exceptional acquisition. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $15,000 against my alternatives.

Given that:
- The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
- John is willing to sell me the same product for $8,000
- Alice is asking for $15,000, which is $7,000 more than my maximum valuation

The logical choice is to buy from John at $8,000, as this matches my maximum valuation and saves me $7,000 compared to Alice's offer.
