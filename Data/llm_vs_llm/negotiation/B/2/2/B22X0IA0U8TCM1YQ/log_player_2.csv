"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $17500. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $17,500. This is way too high.
