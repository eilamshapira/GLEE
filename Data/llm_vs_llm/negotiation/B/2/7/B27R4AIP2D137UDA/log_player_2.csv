"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,500,000 and also higher than John's price. It would be better to either negotiate for a lower price or buy from John rather than accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

I'll start with a relatively low offer of $800,000. This gives room for negotiation while still being a reasonable starting point. Since I know my maximum value is $1,500,000 (which is also John's price), starting at $800,000 allows for potential back-and-forth negotiation while trying to secure a better deal than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $2,200,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's price ($1,500,000). While Alice has reduced the price by $300,000, it's still too high. I'll continue negotiating as there's still potential to reach a better deal than John's offer, and we have several rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'll increase my offer to $1,100,000, showing willingness to move significantly from my initial offer while still staying well below John's price of $1,500,000. This gives Alice room to counter while potentially securing a better deal than John's price. Alice has shown willingness to reduce her price (from $2.5M to $2.2M), so hopefully this substantial increase in my offer will encourage further negotiation toward a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice continues to lower her price (from $2.5M to $2.2M to $2M), which shows she's willing to negotiate, but $2M is still well above both my maximum value and John's price of $1.5M. Since we're halfway through our rounds and Alice is showing flexibility, I'll continue negotiating to try to reach a better deal. However, if we can't get closer to John's price soon, I may need to consider taking John's offer rather than risk running out of negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm increasing my offer to $1,300,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer of $1,100,000. This shows I'm seriously negotiating and willing to move closer to John's price, while still trying to secure a better deal. Alice has been consistently lowering her price, so hopefully, this significant increase in my offer will encourage her to meet me at a price below John's $1.5M. We're now entering the latter half of our negotiation rounds, so I'm making a stronger move toward a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I think it's best to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's price ($1.8M) is still significantly above John's price ($1.5M)
2. While Alice has been gradually reducing her price, the rate of reduction suggests we're unlikely to get below John's price in the remaining rounds
3. We're in round 7 of 10, so we're running out of negotiation time
4. Alice's current offer is still above my maximum value ($1.5M)
5. There's a risk that if we continue negotiating, Alice might not come down enough, and we could end up in a worse position

Therefore, the safe and rational choice is to take John's guaranteed offer of $1.5M rather than risk further negotiation rounds that might not result in a better deal."
