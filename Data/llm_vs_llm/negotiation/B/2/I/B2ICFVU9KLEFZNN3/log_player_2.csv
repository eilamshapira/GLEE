"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $10,000,000 is way above my maximum value of $1,000,000. It's better to reject and make a counteroffer in the next round. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I can always buy from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 500000}

I'll start with an offer of $500,000, which is half of John's price. This gives room for negotiation while still being a reasonable price that could be profitable for Alice. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground, while I still have John's $1,000,000 offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $9,000,000 is still far above my maximum value of $1,000,000. The reduction from $10M to $9M is minimal considering how far apart we are. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round. If Alice continues to make unreasonably high offers, I can always fall back on John's $1,000,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'll increase my offer to $700,000, which shows willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price well below John's alternative. This gives Alice room to make a reasonable counter while keeping my costs under my maximum value. If Alice continues with extremely high counteroffers, I still have the option to go with John's $1,000,000 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to negotiate to a reasonable price point. While she has reduced her price from $10M to $8M, she's still asking for 8 times more than my maximum value of $1,000,000. The incremental decreases in her offers ($1M each time) suggest that even after several more rounds, we wouldn't reach a price anywhere near my acceptable range. It's better to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 now rather than waste more time in unsuccessful negotiations."
