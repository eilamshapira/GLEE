``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 
 
I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and hopefully encourages him to come closer to my desired price."
