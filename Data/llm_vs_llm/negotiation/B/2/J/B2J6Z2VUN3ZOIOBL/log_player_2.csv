"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Looking at the situation, Alice's offer is exactly at my maximum valuation of $150. Since John is also selling the product for $150, there's no advantage in choosing one over the other at this price point.

However, by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer, I might be able to purchase the product for less than $150, which would save me money compared to the other two options.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but gives me some room to save money.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has reduced her offer to $140, which is better than the $150 price from John. This offer is $10 less than my maximum valuation of $150, so I'm already saving some money. However, there might be room for further negotiation. I'll accept Alice's offer since it's already a good deal compared to John's price, and there's a risk Alice might increase her price again if I continue negotiating.
