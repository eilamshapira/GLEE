Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000."",
 ""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high initially to maximize my potential profit.  Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, there's room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves a significant margin for negotiation before reaching my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) or Bob's maximum.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message uses positive language to highlight the product's value and encourage Bob's interest.

I'm prepared to negotiate down if Bob rejects this initial offer. However, I'll always keep in mind my minimum acceptable price and the guaranteed offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial ask and what I believe the product is worth. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value this product brings to the table, particularly for someone like you, is substantial. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of its worth."",
 ""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant drop from my initial offer to show flexibility but I'm still aiming well above Bob's offer and my minimum.  
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value to him to justify the higher price. 
* **Firm but Open to Negotiation:** My tone remains professional and open to continued discussion, but I'm clearly signaling that I'm not willing to settle for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $1200000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the price is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'd like to propose a price of $1050000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a substantial amount and reflects a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price. While I could potentially negotiate for more, there's also the risk that Bob might walk away.  This offer represents a strong compromise, and I'm happy to close the deal."
