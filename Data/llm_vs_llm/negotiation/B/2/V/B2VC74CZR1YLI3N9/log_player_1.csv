Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be beneficial for you. Given its high quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but my budget is much more limited. I can only offer $700000 for the product. Let me know if you can work with that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer to Bob. The $700,000 offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and I know I can always sell to John for $1,000,000. Let me try one more time with Bob at a lower price than my initial offer, but still above my minimum threshold.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, I cannot accept $700,000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I can reduce my initial price to $1,050,000, which is much more reasonable considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the productâ€™s value, but my budget is quite limited. Considering all factors, I'm willing to move up to $750000. This is my best offer given the market conditions and my own constraints. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's new offer of $750,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and he's only increased his offer by a small amount, it seems unlikely we'll reach an agreement that meets my needs. John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 is the better option, as it meets my minimum price requirement and eliminates further negotiation uncertainty."
