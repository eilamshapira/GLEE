"After some consideration, I think a more suitable price would be $9000. Does that align with your expectations? Let me know your thoughts.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $9000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10750?",10750.0,Alice,3,

"I am looking for a better deal. How about we settle for $9750 instead? This price seems more reasonable to me, considering my budget. What do you think?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  $9750 is still quite low, but I'm willing to come down to $10250.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise.",10250.0,Alice,5,
