"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the unique nature of the product, however, that price is a bit too high for me. I would be willing to pay $10000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and the offer you've made. However, I must say that $10000 is a bit below my expectations, considering the product's value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to meet somewhere closer to the middle. I can offer it to you for $22000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.",22000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my asking price. However, $13000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. Considering we're getting closer, I'm willing to make another adjustment. I can offer the product to you for $20000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise.",20000.0,Alice,5,
