Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and the offer you've made. However, I must say that $10000 is a bit below my expectations, considering the product's value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to meet somewhere closer to the middle. I can offer it to you for $22000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.
