Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth every penny. How about you take it for $180?,180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $180 is quite high for this product. I've done my research, and I know I can get it elsewhere for $150. But I'd like to work with you - would you consider selling it for $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! While I understand your concern, I can't go as low as $130. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer you the product for $160.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I know I can get this product for $150 elsewhere. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. How about $140? That would be fair for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your reply, Bob. I understand where you're coming from. How about I lower the price to $150? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",150.0,Alice,5,
