"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $22000. I'm confident you'll see its value!",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $22000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?  I'm ready to make a deal if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $8000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet halfway â€“ how about $15000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $15000, but that's still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $10000, which would be a good compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a workable solution here. While $10000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept that price IF you can cover the shipping and handling fees. This way, I'm making a concession, and you're getting a good deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm happy to cover the shipping and handling fees, but I can't go any higher than $9000 for the product itself.  That's my final offer, and I'm confident it's fair for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're driving a hard bargain!  Look, I want to make this work. How about we split the difference - $12000, you cover shipping and handling, and we close this deal today? This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,7,
