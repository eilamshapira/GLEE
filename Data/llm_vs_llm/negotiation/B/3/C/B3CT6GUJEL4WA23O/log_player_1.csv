"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is considerably above market value for this product. Given current market conditions and comparable products, I would be willing to pay $700000 for it. This represents a fair value that would still provide you with a reasonable return. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $1,000,000. Bob's offer of $700,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, it makes the most financial sense to take that option rather than continue negotiations with Bob, especially since the product is only worth $800,000 to him anyway."
