"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1200000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer is $1,200,000
2. The product is worth $800,000 to me (maximum I'm willing to pay)
3. I can buy from John for $800,000 at any time
4. I have 10 rounds to negotiate

Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000). Since we have multiple rounds to negotiate, it makes sense to reject this initial high offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still reasonable considering the product's worth to her ($1,000,000).

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,200,000 is considerably above market value for this product. Given current market conditions and comparable products, I would be willing to pay $700,000 for it. This represents a fair value that would still provide you with a reasonable return."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
