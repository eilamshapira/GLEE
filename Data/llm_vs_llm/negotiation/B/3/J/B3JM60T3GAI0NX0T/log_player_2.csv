"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","In this situation, Alice's offer ($10,000) is the same as John's price ($10,000), and it equals the maximum amount I'm willing to pay. Since there's no price advantage between the sellers, I might as well accept Alice's offer directly rather than going through the process of rejection and buying from John.
