"Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $5000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $5000 is significantly lower than what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $12000? This is still a great deal for a product of this quality.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down from $20000, but $12000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $8500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $8500 is still below what I need to make this worth my time. I'm willing to go to $10000, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
