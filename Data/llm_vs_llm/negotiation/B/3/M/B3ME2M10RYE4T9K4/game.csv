"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love!  I'm asking for $200 for it.  Let me know what you think.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, though. How about $175?  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $175 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $125.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can agree on this.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $125 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $150? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $150 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you at $135.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can finally agree on a deal.",135.0,Bob,6,
