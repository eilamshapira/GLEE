Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while still being within Bob's potential range.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","I'll reject Bob's offer as it's too close to my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) and not much better than John's standing offer. Given that the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, there's room for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial $14,000, but still maintain a strong position since I know Bob values the product at $15,000.

{""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","$12,000 is a reasonable offer that gives me a good profit above my minimum price ($10,000) and John's standing offer. While it's not the maximum I hoped for, it's a fair compromise that represents 80% of Bob's valuation ($15,000). I'll accept this offer to conclude the negotiation successfully.
