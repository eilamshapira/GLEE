"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $14000 is quite steep for this product. Given market conditions and comparable products, I'd be willing to pay $9500 for it. This gives you a reasonable profit margin while being fair to me as well. I'm looking forward to reaching an agreement that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, after considering your perspective, I'm willing to lower my offer to $12000. This price reflects the product's value and benefits both parties. I'm looking forward to your positive response.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12000 is still on the high side for me. I can offer $10500, which would give you a solid $2500 profit on the product. This seems like a fair middle ground between our positions. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, after giving it some thought, I'm willing to lower my previous offer to $11000. This price takes into account both our interests and brings us closer to an agreement. I believe it's a fair deal for both parties. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. We're definitely getting closer. I can meet you at $10800, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value. This gives you a substantial profit while allowing me to stay within my budget. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",10800.0,Bob,6,
