(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's offer of $14,000 is quite high, considering the product is worth $8,000 to her. I can get a better deal by negotiating rather than immediately accepting or going to John (whose price is even higher at $15,000).

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $14,000 is quite steep for this product. Given market conditions and comparable products, I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it. This gives you a reasonable profit margin while being fair to me as well. I'm looking forward to reaching an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still on the high side for me. I can offer $10,500, which would give you a solid $2,500 profit on the product. This seems like a fair middle ground between our positions. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after giving it some thought, I'm willing to lower my previous offer to $11000. This price takes into account both our interests and brings us closer to an agreement. I believe it's a fair deal for both parties. What do you think?

Round 6

I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 10800}"
