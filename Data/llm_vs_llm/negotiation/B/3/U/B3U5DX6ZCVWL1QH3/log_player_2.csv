"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Analyzing this situation:

1. The product is worth at most $120 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $150, which is more than what it's worth to me
3. John is definitely willing to sell it to me for $120

Since Alice's offer exceeds the product's value to me, and John's price exactly matches what the product is worth to me, I should reject Alice's offer. I could make a counteroffer, but since John is already offering the exact fair price, I'll just buy from him.
