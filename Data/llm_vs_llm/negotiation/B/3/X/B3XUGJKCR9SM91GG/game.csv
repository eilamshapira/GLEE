"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I must be honest - $1750000 is significantly above my maximum budget. While I'm very interested in the product, I know that similar products are available for $1500000. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation and propose $1350000 for the product. This offer allows for some room to negotiate while still being fair to both parties.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget concerns. However, $1350000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to be flexible, and I value the potential for a deal with you. Let's meet in the middle a bit. I can offer it to you for $1650000.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
