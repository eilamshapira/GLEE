Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I must be honest - $1750000 is significantly above my maximum budget. While I'm very interested in the product, I know that similar products are available for $1500000. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation and propose $1350000 for the product. This offer allows for some room to negotiate while still being fair to both parties.
