"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find the price to be a bit high. I'm willing to pay $6000 for the product. Would you consider this offer?",6000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, the $6000 price is below our minimum threshold. I'm willing to lower the price to $11000, which still reflects the high value of the product. Please let me know if this works for you.",11000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
