"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice's offer is $1,200,000, which is $300,000 less than my maximum value for the product and also $300,000 less than John's price.

Since Alice's first offer is already below my maximum price point and significantly better than John's alternative, it would be wise to accept this offer.
