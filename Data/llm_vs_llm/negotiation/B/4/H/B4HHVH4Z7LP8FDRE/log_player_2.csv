"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. Given its exceptional quality and value, I'm pricing it at $120. I believe it's a fair price considering what it can do for you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $120, but the product is only worth $80 to me, so accepting this offer would mean I'm paying $40 more than the product's value to me.

John is selling the exact same product for $80, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me. 

Since Alice's initial offer is significantly above my valuation, and I already have access to a guaranteed purchase option at $80 from John, I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. If Alice doesn't accept a reasonable counteroffer, I can always buy from John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I need to be honest - the product is only worth about $80 to me. In fact, I have another seller, John, who's offering the exact same product for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Would you be willing to sell it for $70? This would save me a bit compared to John's price while still giving you a sale."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your honesty and for considering doing business with me. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must say that $70 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, given the product's value to me. I'd like to meet you halfway between your offer and my initial price, but taking into account the value of the product to you. I can offer you the product for $90. This way, you'll still get a better understanding of the price, and I'll get a fair return on my investment. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to consider this new offer from Alice. She's now offering the product for $90, which is $10 more than what the product is worth to me ($80) and $10 more than what John is selling it for.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and John is offering the same product for $80 (which matches exactly what the product is worth to me), the economically rational decision would be to buy from John.

Alice has already lowered her price significantly from $120 to $90, but it's still above both my valuation and my alternative option. While I could try another counteroffer, I already have a guaranteed option to purchase at my maximum valuation.
