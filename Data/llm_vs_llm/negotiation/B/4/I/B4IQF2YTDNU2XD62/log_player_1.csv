Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is lower than the product's worth to me and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

My counteroffer is: $1,400,000

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me at a higher price. If not, I still have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000. 

Formally, my response is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still lower than what I can get from John ($1,200,000), but closer to my desired price, I will reject Bob's offer again and try to negotiate further to see if I can get an even better price from him.

My counteroffer is: $1,250,000

If Bob is not willing to meet me at this price, I will consider selling to John.
