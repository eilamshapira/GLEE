You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay, and I have the option to buy the product from John for the same price, I don't see any benefit in accepting Alice's offer immediately. I'd like to try to negotiate a better price with Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, to see how she responds.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer is $1,000 lower than her initial offer, which is a good sign that she's willing to negotiate. However, I still think I can get a better price.

Since I have 8 rounds left, I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to make a more reasonable counteroffer. This time, I'll meet her halfway between my previous offer and her new offer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 3, Alice's offer was $14,000, and my previous offer was $5,000. To meet her halfway, I'll calculate the midpoint: ($14,000 + $5,000) / 2 = $9,500.

I'll send Alice a counteroffer of $9,500.
