"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $140 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $120 is a step in the right direction, I believe we can meet in the middle. Given the product's value, I'm willing to offer it at $130, which represents a significant discount from my initial price. This is a fair price that would benefit both of us. What do you say?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $125. This price still represents a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to make a purchase at this price. Would you be willing to accept $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
