Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I know would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $140, which is a fair price considering its worth. Would you like to purchase it?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $140 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe we can find a middle ground that's more beneficial for both of us."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $120 is a step in the right direction, I believe we can meet in the middle.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $125. This price still represents a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to make a purchase at this price. Would you be willing to accept $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $125. This is a reasonable compromise and better than both continuing negotiations (which might risk losing the deal) or selling to John for $100."
