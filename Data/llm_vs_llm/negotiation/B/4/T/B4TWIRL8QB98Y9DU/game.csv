"Hello Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it for $115, which is a fair price considering its quality and utility. Would you like to purchase it?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $115 is a bit high for me. Given that similar products are available in the market, I'd like to offer $105, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price. However, $105 is too close to my minimum acceptable price. I can come down to $112, which I believe is quite reasonable considering the quality and value of this product. This is still a good deal for you.",112.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, I know there are similar products available in the market at lower prices. I can increase my offer to $108, which would be a fair middle ground between our positions. This gives you a good profit margin while being a reasonable price for me.",108.0,Bob,4,
