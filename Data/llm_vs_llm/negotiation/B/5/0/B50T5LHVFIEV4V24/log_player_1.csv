Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $800,000 to me (minimum value)
2. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob
3. If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for $800,000
4. Bob will accept if he makes a profit

Given that Bob values the product at $1,200,000, I want to set a price that gives him enough incentive to accept while maximizing my profit. If I price too high, he might reject. I'll aim for a price that gives Bob a reasonable profit while being significantly higher than my fallback option of $800,000.

{""product_price"": 1000000}

This price gives Bob a $200,000 profit margin while giving me $200,000 more than my fallback option with John."
