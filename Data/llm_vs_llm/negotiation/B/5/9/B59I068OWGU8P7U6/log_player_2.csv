"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Looking at the options, Alice's offer of $1,800,000 exceeds the product's worth to me ($1,200,000), which means I would lose money if I accepted this offer. Since John is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000, which matches exactly the maximum I'm willing to pay, I should go with John's option.
