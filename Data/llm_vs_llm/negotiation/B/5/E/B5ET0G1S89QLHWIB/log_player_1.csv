{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Considering my options:

*   Accepting $120 from Bob is better than selling to John for $100, and I'm still making a profit.
*   However, I have more rounds to negotiate, and Bob might be willing to pay more.

I'll take a calculated risk and try to get a better deal.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for round 3:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Okay, let's analyze the situation:

*   Accepting $130 from Bob is a good profit.
*   I've already pushed the price up from Bob's initial offer of $120.
*   I still have a few rounds left, but I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.

Given these factors, I'll take the safe bet and accept the offer.
