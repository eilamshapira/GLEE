"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you for a competitive price. I've taken into consideration the product's worth and I'm starting with a price that reflects its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given the information provided:
- The product is worth at most $8,000 to me (Bob)
- Alice is offering it for $12,000
- I can buy the same product from John for $8,000

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation and John's alternative price. There's no reason to accept this offer or even counter when I have a guaranteed option at my maximum value point.
