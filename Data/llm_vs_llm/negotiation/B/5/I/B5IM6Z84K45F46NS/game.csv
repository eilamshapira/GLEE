"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is far below what I can accept. The product is quite valuable, and I have another buyer willing to pay $15000. However, I'm willing to negotiate with you. How about $16000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16000 is still above my budget. Considering you mentioned another buyer is willing to pay $15000, I'd like to meet you halfway between that and my previous offer. How about $11500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
