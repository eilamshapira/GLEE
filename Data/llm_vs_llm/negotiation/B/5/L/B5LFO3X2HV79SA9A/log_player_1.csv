"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that I know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob and $15,000 to me, I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum acceptable price.

{""product_price"": 17500}

I'm starting high because:
1. It leaves room for negotiation
2. I know I have John's guaranteed offer of $15,000 as a backup
3. If Bob really wants the product, he might counter with a more reasonable offer that we can work with"
