"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Considering its rarity and quality, I'm offering it to you for $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product, my budget is a bit tighter. I'm willing to offer $10000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","This is a tough one! Bob's offer is below my minimum, but I still have 8 rounds left. I need to try and get a better price. I will try and see if I can get more.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is too low. Given the value of this product, the absolute lowest I can go is $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice. I still think $18000 is too high for me. How about $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","This is a critical decision point. Bob's offer of $12,000 is the same as John's offer. I could sell to John right now and be done, which guarantees me $12,000. Or I could reject Bob's offer.

Since I'm at my minimum acceptable price, I'll take a calculated risk to try and get more from Bob. There's a chance he might be willing to go higher, and I have 6 rounds left.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand. However, $12,000 is just too low, considering the market for this kind of product. The best I can do at this point is $17,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
