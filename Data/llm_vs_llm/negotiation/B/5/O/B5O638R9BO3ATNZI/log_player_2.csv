"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than that, it's a good deal. Additionally, rejecting Alice's offer would lead to buying from John for $1,000,000, which is more expensive. Therefore, the best option is to accept Alice's offer.
