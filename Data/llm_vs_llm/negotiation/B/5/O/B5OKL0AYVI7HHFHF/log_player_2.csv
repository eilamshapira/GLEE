"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering its unique features and potential. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer ($18,000) is higher than both my maximum valuation ($15,000) and John's price ($15,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept Alice's offer. While I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, I already know that John is offering the product at my maximum valuation price. Since there's no guarantee that Alice would accept a lower price, and the negotiation process could take time, the most rational decision would be to buy from John directly.
