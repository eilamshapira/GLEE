"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this truly unique and valuable asset. I believe it could be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking $1750000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer ($1,750,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), there's no reason to accept this offer. I could try negotiating with Alice by making a counteroffer, but since I can get the product from John for $1,000,000, which is already at my maximum valuation, the best decision is to buy from John.
