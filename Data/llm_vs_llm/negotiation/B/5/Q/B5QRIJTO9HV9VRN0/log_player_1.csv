(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Given Bob's incredibly low counteroffer of $500,000, which is significantly below my minimum value of $1,200,000, I have to reject it. I also won't immediately sell to John.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, I'll make a counteroffer, but I'm not budging much from my original price. I need to try to find a middle ground, but I still need to prioritize my own value.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, I'm starting to get a little worried here. Bob's offers are consistently low, which makes me think he might not be willing to pay very much at all. I'll lower my price slightly, but still aim high.

{""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is getting frustrating. Bob's offers are still way too low. I'm losing confidence that I'll get a good deal with him. However, I also don't want to jump the gun and sell to John just yet. I'll reject the offer and give it one more try.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, this is my last attempt before I consider selling to John. I'll lower my price significantly this time, but I still need to try to get a decent return.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","At this point, Bob is clearly not valuing the product highly, and I've already made multiple concessions. $700,000 is still too low. However, I'm also losing time and opportunity. I've decided to cut my losses and sell to John.
