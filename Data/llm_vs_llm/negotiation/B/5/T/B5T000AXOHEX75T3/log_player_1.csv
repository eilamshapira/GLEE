"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product and I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start by making a high offer. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially settle on a higher price than if I started with a lower offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and also lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,200,000), and I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate, I will reject Bob's offer.

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer, in an attempt to meet Bob somewhere in the middle and maximize my earnings.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $500,000 and my initial offer was $2,500,000, I'll try to find a middle ground while still being mindful of my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial offer but still reflects the value I believe the product holds.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's new offer of $600,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Since I have 6 rounds left to negotiate and Bob has slightly increased his offer from $500,000 to $600,000, it indicates he might be willing to pay more. However, the increase is not significant enough to suggest he's close to my minimum acceptable price.

Given this, I will reject Bob's offer again and proceed to make another counteroffer. This time, I will lower my price slightly from $2,000,000 to try and encourage Bob to meet me closer to my minimum acceptable price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's last offer was $600,000 and my previous offer was $2,000,000, I'll try to bring my offer down to a point where it might be more appealing to Bob, while still being significantly above his last offer. I'll reduce my offer by a substantial amount to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below $1,200,000, as that's the minimum value I've placed on the product.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer has increased to $650,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Given that we are halfway through the negotiation rounds and Bob's offers, although increasing, are not significantly closing the gap to my minimum acceptable price, I need to consider the risk of not reaching an agreement.

However, since Bob continues to increase his offer, it suggests he is interested in the product and might be willing to pay more. I will reject his current offer and consider making a counteroffer that brings the price down further but still remains above my minimum acceptable price.

Before making the counteroffer, I must weigh the potential of reaching a higher agreement with Bob against the certainty of selling to John for $1,200,000. Given the current gap, I'll proceed with caution and make another counteroffer, hoping to encourage Bob to increase his offer more substantially.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Given that Bob's last offer was $650,000 and considering I need to balance the potential for a higher sale price with the risk of not reaching an agreement, I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than my previous one but still above my minimum acceptable price. This round, I'll bring the price down to $1,500,000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offer of $1,800,000, in an attempt to signal to Bob that I'm serious about finding a mutually agreeable price.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer has increased to $700,000, but it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. With only two rounds left, I need to consider the likelihood of Bob increasing his offer to a point that meets or exceeds my minimum acceptable price.

Given the incremental increases in Bob's offers, it seems unlikely that he will jump to $1,200,000 or higher in the next round. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, which is still higher than Bob's current offer.

At this point, the potential benefit of continuing to negotiate with Bob does not outweigh the certainty of selling to John for $1,200,000. Therefore, I will choose to sell the product to John.
