(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $800,000, Alice's offer of $2,500,000 is far too high. I'll reject this offer and prepare a counteroffer for the next round.

However, this is still significantly higher than the $800,000 maximum value the product has to me, and the guaranteed price from John. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her price to $1,500,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but it's still nearly double the maximum value to me and John's price. With only a few rounds remaining and Alice's offers still far above my maximum, I need to decide whether to continue negotiating or take John's guaranteed price.

Given that we've had three rounds of offers and counteroffers without getting close to my maximum of $800,000, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating, but I may need to consider John's offer soon if we don't make significant progress.
