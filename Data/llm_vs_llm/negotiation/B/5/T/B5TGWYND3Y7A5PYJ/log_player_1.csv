Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what price to offer Bob that maximizes my earnings while still being acceptable to him.

The product is worth $120 to Bob, so any price up to $120 would theoretically be acceptable to him. However, if I price it too high, he might reject the offer.

If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell to John for $100, which is my minimum acceptable price.

I want to capture some of the surplus value between my minimum ($100) and Bob's maximum ($120). If I offer slightly below Bob's maximum value, it gives him a small incentive to accept while still giving me most of the potential profit.
