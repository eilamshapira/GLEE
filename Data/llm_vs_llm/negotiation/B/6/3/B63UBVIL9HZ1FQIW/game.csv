"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $15000 is much too high for me. I can actually get the same product from another seller for $8000. However, I'm willing to work with you if we can find a fair price. I can offer you $7000 for the product. This would save me some money compared to my other option, and still provide you with a reasonable sale.",7000.0,Bob,2,
