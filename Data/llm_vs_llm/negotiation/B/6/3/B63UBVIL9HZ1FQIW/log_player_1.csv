Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $15,000. Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $15000 is much too high for me. I can actually get the same product from another seller for $8000. However, I'm willing to work with you if we can find a fair price. I can offer you $7000 for the product. This would save me some money compared to my other option, and still provide you with a reasonable sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
