"Hi Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $80.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is significantly below its value. I can come down to $150.  This is my best offer.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $150 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $115.  This is my final offer.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, while I'd like to meet you halfway, I have a bottom line too. I can do $130.  This offer takes into account my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal considering the value you're getting.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $120, which is a fair compromise considering we are both trying to find common ground.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,6,
