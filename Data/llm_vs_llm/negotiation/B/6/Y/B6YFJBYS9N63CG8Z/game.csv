"Alice, your initial price is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $7000 at this time.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $7000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. The inherent value and potential return on investment are much greater. However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $22000?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about your maximum. While $9000 is still below my minimum, I see we are moving closer. Let's try to meet in the middle a bit more. How about $19000?",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $19000 is still much higher than I can afford. My absolute maximum remains at $9000. I have another offer for $12000, so I need you to come down significantly to make this worthwhile.",9000.0,Bob,6,
