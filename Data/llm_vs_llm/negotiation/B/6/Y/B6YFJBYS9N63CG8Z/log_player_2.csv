"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Its value is undeniable, and I believe it could be a significant asset for you. To begin, I'm offering it to you for $25000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","The product's value to me is no more than $12,000. Alice is offering it for $25,000, which is way above my maximum price. Buying from John is a better option than accepting Alice's offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice's initial offer is far too high. I'll start with a low counteroffer to gauge her flexibility and see how close we can get to my target price.

```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial price is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $7,000 at this time."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $7000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. The inherent value and potential return on investment are much greater. However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $22000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice is still way above my maximum price of $12,000. Even though she lowered her price from $25,000 to $22,000, it's still not a reasonable offer for me. Buying from John is still better than accepting this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice's price is still too high. I will increase my offer slightly, but also emphasize my budget limit.

```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $22,000 is still significantly beyond my budget. My absolute maximum for this product is $9,000. Can you work with that?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about your maximum. While $9000 is still below my minimum, I see we are moving closer. Let's try to meet in the middle a bit more. How about $19000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice is still extremely far away from my maximum price. I will reject her offer and consider buying from John in the next round if Alice doesn't come down significantly.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice is moving slowly, but still significantly above my limit. I'll reiterate my maximum and the fact that I have another option available.

```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $19,000 is still much higher than I can afford. My absolute maximum remains at $9,000. I have another offer for $12,000, so I need you to come down significantly to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
