"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I'm confident it will provide significant value to you. My offer price is highly competitive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer compared to what I know about my own valuation and the alternative option.

Alice is offering the product for $20,000. However, I know that:
1. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
2. John is willing to sell me the same product for $12,000

Since Alice's offer ($20,000) exceeds both my maximum valuation ($12,000) and the alternative price from John ($12,000), it would not be rational for me to accept Alice's offer.

The logical choice is to buy from John at $12,000, which matches my maximum valuation and saves me $8,000 compared to Alice's offer.
