"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $105 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($100) but lower than what I was hoping for, and we have multiple rounds left to negotiate, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be $117.50, which is slightly lower than my initial offer but still closer to the value Bob has for the product ($120).

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my counteroffer is $117.50."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer of $110 is getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since we have 6 rounds left to negotiate, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer again and make another counteroffer.

My next counteroffer will be $115, which is a bit lower than my previous offer but still reflects the value that Bob has for the product.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
