"Hi Bob, I'd like to offer you this product for $200. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be satisfied with the value it provides.",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know the product's market value, and I can actually purchase it from another seller for $150. I'd like to offer you $130 for it. This way we both benefit - you make a quick sale and I get a small discount compared to my alternative option.",130.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your perspective, Bob. However, given the value of the product and our mutual interest in making a fair deal, I can offer it to you for $160. I believe this is a reasonable compromise for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be transparent with you - I can purchase this identical product from John for $150, which is the maximum value this product has to me. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I would need to pay less than that alternative. I can offer you $140, which gives you a quicker sale while still being a better deal for me than my other option.",140.0,Bob,4,
