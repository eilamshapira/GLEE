Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'd like to offer you this product for $200. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be satisfied with the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know the product's market value, and I can actually purchase it from another seller for $150. I'd like to offer you $130 for it. This way we both benefit - you make a quick sale and I get a small discount compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be transparent with you - I can purchase this identical product from John for $150, which is the maximum value this product has to me. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I would need to pay less than that alternative. I can offer you $140, which gives you a quicker sale while still being a better deal for me than my other option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
