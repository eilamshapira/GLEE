"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to offer you this product for $200. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be satisfied with the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is asking for $200, which is actually above the value of the product to me ($150). Since John is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $150, and that's the maximum I value this product at, Alice's offer doesn't make economic sense for me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know the product's market value, and I can actually purchase it from another seller for $150. I'd like to offer you $130 for it. This way we both benefit - you make a quick sale and I get a small discount compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your perspective, Bob. However, given the value of the product and our mutual interest in making a fair deal, I can offer it to you for $160. I believe this is a reasonable compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to evaluate this counteroffer carefully. Alice has come down significantly from $200 to $160, which shows willingness to negotiate. However, the offer is still $10 more than John's price of $150, and $150 is the maximum value this product has to me. Since I can get the exact same product from John for $150, it wouldn't be rational for me to pay more than that.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be transparent with you - I can purchase this identical product from John for $150, which is the maximum value this product has to me. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I would need to pay less than that alternative. I can offer you $140, which gives you a quicker sale while still being a better deal for me than my other option."", ""product_price"": 140}"
