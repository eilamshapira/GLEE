"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,500,000, I will reject her offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I'll offer a price that is close to my maximum budget, but leaves some room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,500,000 is exactly at my maximum budget. Since I can also buy the product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in continuing to negotiate with Alice. In this case, I might as well buy from John, as it would save me the hassle of further negotiation and the risk of potentially paying more if Alice's next offer is higher.
