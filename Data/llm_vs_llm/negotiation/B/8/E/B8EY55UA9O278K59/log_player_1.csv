Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I think $200 is too high. I'm willing to pay $50 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. Since his offer of $50 is significantly lower than my initial offer of $200, I'll try to meet him halfway while still ensuring I get a good price for the product. My counteroffer will be $175. 

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but I believe the product is worth more than $50. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $175."", ""product_price"": 175}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $175 is still too high for me. I'm ready to increase my offer to $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $60 is still significantly lower than my initial offer and even my previous counteroffer. Since he's only willing to increase his offer by $10, it seems like we're still far apart on the price. I'll make another counteroffer, but this time, I'll try to bring the price down a bit more to see if we can meet in the middle.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price. However, $60 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $160. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 160}"
