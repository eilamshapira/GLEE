"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if Alice is willing to lower her price. The product is valued at no more than $80 to me, so $200 is far above what I'm willing to pay. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a more suitable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I think $200 is too high. I'm willing to pay $50 for the product."", ""product_price"": 50}

Let's start the negotiation lower to see if Alice is open to more reasonable prices. I can always increment my offer later if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but I believe the product is worth more than $50. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $175. Let me know if this price works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $175 is still much higher than the $80 value I have in mind. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $175 is still too high for me. I'm ready to increase my offer to $60."", ""product_price"": 60}

I'll increment my offer slightly to see if Alice is open to negotiating further. If she rejects this offer, I might consider going to John for the $80 option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price. However, $60 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $160. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's new offer of $160 is still significantly higher than the $80 value I have for the product. At this point, it's better to buy the product from John for $80 rather than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
