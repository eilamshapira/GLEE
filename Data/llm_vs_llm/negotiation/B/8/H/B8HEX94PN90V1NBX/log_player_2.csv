"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum price. You should make a counteroffer significantly lower to see how flexible Alice is willing to be."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $50?"",
""product_price"": 50
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial price. It gives you room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a good deal below your maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. While $50 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $70.  This is still a great deal for a fantastic product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice lowered her price significantly and it is now below your maximum budget. While you could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are small and risk Alice withdrawing the offer. $70 is a good deal."
