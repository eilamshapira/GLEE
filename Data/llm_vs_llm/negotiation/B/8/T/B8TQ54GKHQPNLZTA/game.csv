"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, the price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and offer. I appreciate your response, but $1000000 is significantly below the value of this product. My minimum acceptable price is $1500000, which is actually the same amount another buyer (John) is ready to pay right now. However, I'd like to give you the opportunity to purchase it since I believe you could benefit greatly from this product. I can come down to $2100000, which is still a fair price considering the product's quality and potential return on investment. What do you think?",2100000.0,Alice,3,
