Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and offer. I appreciate your response, but $1,000,000 is significantly below the value of this product. My minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000, which is actually the same amount another buyer (John) is ready to pay right now. However, I'd like to give you the opportunity to purchase it since I believe you could benefit greatly from this product. I can come down to $2,100,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's quality and potential return on investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2100000}"
