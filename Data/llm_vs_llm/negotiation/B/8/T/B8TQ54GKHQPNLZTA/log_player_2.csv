Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and offer. I appreciate your response, but $1000000 is significantly below the value of this product. My minimum acceptable price is $1500000, which is actually the same amount another buyer (John) is ready to pay right now. However, I'd like to give you the opportunity to purchase it since I believe you could benefit greatly from this product. I can come down to $2100000, which is still a fair price considering the product's quality and potential return on investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,100,000
