Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to strategize my pricing. The product is worth at least $120 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120 if Bob rejects my offer.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I should offer a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $120, but not so high that Bob will certainly reject it.

A reasonable approach would be to price it significantly above $120 to capture more value if Bob accepts, while knowing I still have my $120 fallback with John.
