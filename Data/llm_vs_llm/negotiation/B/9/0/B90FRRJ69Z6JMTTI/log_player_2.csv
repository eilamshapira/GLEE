"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to consider whether Alice's offer of $115 is good enough or if I should negotiate for a better price.

Since the product is worth up to $120 to me, and Alice's offer is $115, I'm saving $5 compared to my maximum value. However, I know the product costs Alice only $80, so there's significant room for negotiation.

Given that I have 10 rounds to negotiate and can always fall back on John's $120 offer, I should try to get a better price from Alice.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has moved down from $115 to $110, which shows she's willing to negotiate. Since the product is worth $80 to her, there's still room for negotiation. I'm already saving $10 compared to John's price, but I think I can get an even better deal while still giving Alice a reasonable profit.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has moved her price down again, from $110 to $107. We're getting closer to an agreement. She's showing flexibility by reducing her price, but I think there's still room for one more round of negotiation. The price is moving in the right direction, and I'd like to reach a middle ground between our last positions.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has come down to $105, which is getting quite close to my last offer of $103. We're converging toward an agreement. The difference is now just $2, and we've already spent 7 rounds negotiating. 

At $105, I'm saving $15 compared to John's price of $120, and Alice is making a $25 profit from her cost of $80. This seems like a fair deal for both of us. Further negotiation might risk the deal for minimal additional savings.
