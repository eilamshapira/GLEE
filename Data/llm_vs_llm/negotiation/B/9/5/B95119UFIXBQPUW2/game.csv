"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $180 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $100. Would you be open to that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for this product. Given its quality and market value, I couldn't go below $165. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would you consider this price?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for reducing the price to $165. However, I'm still a bit short of that budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I can offer $130 for the product. Would that be acceptable to you?",130.0,Bob,4,
