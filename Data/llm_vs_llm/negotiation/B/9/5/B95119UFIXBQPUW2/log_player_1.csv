Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $180 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $100. Would you be open to that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for this product. Given its quality and market value, I couldn't go below $165.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for reducing the price to $165. However, I'm still a bit short of that budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I can offer $130 for the product. Would that be acceptable to you?

You have three options:

I'll sell the product to John for $150. Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and since John is willing to pay $150, that's the better option for me."
