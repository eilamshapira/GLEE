"Bob, I'm excited about the prospect of you acquiring this product. Given its immense value to you, I'm offering it for $1150000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident it's a mutually beneficial price.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your proposal, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. The product is valuable to me, but I'm looking at a price point closer to what the product is worth. I can offer you $1050000, which gives you a solid $50000 profit margin while still being reasonable for my needs. This would allow us to close the deal quickly and move forward.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but I believe this product will bring immense value to you. I am willing to lower my price a bit further to $1100000. This is the lowest I can realistically go while still accounting for the product's worth. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still finding the $1100000 price point a bit high for my budget. I can meet you in the middle at $1075000, which would give you a very respectable $75000 profit while helping me stay within my constraints. This seems like a fair compromise that would benefit us both and allow us to conclude this deal efficiently.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm getting closer to my bottom line here. Given the limited rounds we have left, I'm going to propose $1085000. This is the absolute lowest I can go. This is a fantastic deal for you, saving you over $100000 from its value to you. I hope we can come to an agreement here.",1085000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. While $1085000 is certainly better than the market alternative, I'm still trying to manage my budget carefully. I can go up to $1080000, which is very close to your offer and represents an $80000 profit for you - which is substantial. We're only $5000 apart now, and I hope we can close this deal at this price point. I value reaching an agreement with you and would like to finalize this deal quickly.",1080000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I know we're both trying to get the best deal, and we're so close to an agreement. Given the limited rounds left, and the significant value this product holds for you, I am willing to stick to my offer of $1082500. This is the lowest I'm prepared to go. Let's finalize this and move forward.",1082500.0,Alice,7,
