Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your proposal, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. The product is valuable to me, but I'm looking at a price point closer to what the product is worth. I can offer you $1050000, which gives you a solid $50000 profit margin while still being reasonable for my needs. This would allow us to close the deal quickly and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still finding the $1100000 price point a bit high for my budget. I can meet you in the middle at $1075000, which would give you a very respectable $75000 profit while helping me stay within my constraints. This seems like a fair compromise that would benefit us both and allow us to conclude this deal efficiently.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. While $1085000 is certainly better than the market alternative, I'm still trying to manage my budget carefully.
