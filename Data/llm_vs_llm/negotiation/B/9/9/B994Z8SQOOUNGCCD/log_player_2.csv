"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited about the prospect of you acquiring this product. Given its immense value to you, I'm offering it for $1150000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident it's a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $1,150,000, which is less than John's price of $1,200,000, so that's good. However, I believe there's room for negotiation since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your proposal, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. The product is valuable to me, but I'm looking at a price point closer to what the product is worth. I can offer you $1,050,000, which gives you a solid $50,000 profit margin while still being reasonable for my needs. This would allow us to close the deal quickly and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but I believe this product will bring immense value to you. I am willing to lower my price a bit further to $1100000. This is the lowest I can realistically go while still accounting for the product's worth. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I see Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is a $50,000 reduction from her initial offer. This is moving in the right direction, but I still believe there's room for further negotiation. The price is now $100,000 less than John's alternative, so I'm in a good position to continue negotiating.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still finding the $1,100,000 price point a bit high for my budget. I can meet you in the middle at $1,075,000, which would give you a very respectable $75,000 profit while helping me stay within my constraints. This seems like a fair compromise that would benefit us both and allow us to conclude this deal efficiently."", ""product_price"": 1075000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting closer to my bottom line here. Given the limited rounds we have left, I'm going to propose $1085000. This is the absolute lowest I can go. This is a fantastic deal for you, saving you over $100000 from its value to you. I hope we can come to an agreement here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000.

She's claiming this is her absolute lowest price, but we still have several rounds of negotiation available. The current offer is significantly better than John's price of $1,200,000, giving me $115,000 in savings. However, I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground between our positions.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. While $1,085,000 is certainly better than the market alternative, I'm still trying to manage my budget carefully. I can go up to $1,080,000, which is very close to your offer and represents an $80,000 profit for you - which is substantial. We're only $5,000 apart now, and I hope we can close this deal at this price point. I value reaching an agreement with you and would like to finalize this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1080000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I know we're both trying to get the best deal, and we're so close to an agreement. Given the limited rounds left, and the significant value this product holds for you, I am willing to stick to my offer of $1082500. This is the lowest I'm prepared to go. Let's finalize this and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,082,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I notice Alice has now offered $1,082,500, which is a small $2,500 reduction from her previous offer of $1,085,000. We're getting very close to agreement, with only a $2,500 difference between our positions. At this point, the price is $117,500 less than John's alternative of $1,200,000, which represents significant savings.

Given that we've nearly reached the middle point between our positions, and considering we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, I think it's reasonable to accept this offer.
