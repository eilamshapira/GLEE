Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This is a good starting point. It's below your minimum but gives Bob room to negotiate.  If he rejects, you can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I need. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. Hopefully, this will be attractive enough to Bob, but I'm still prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. $950,000 is much closer to what I wanted, and it's still significantly more than what Bob initially offered. It's also a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by pushing for more."
