Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm selling this amazing product. Considering its quality, I think a fair price would be $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the quality you're describing, but $95 is a bit high for me. Given similar products in the market, I'd be comfortable paying $85 for it. This gives you a reasonable profit while allowing me to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, I have a decision to make. Considering my minimum acceptable price is $80, and Bob is now offering $85... I should accept.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
