"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm selling this amazing product. Considering its quality, I think a fair price would be $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation. 

Alice is offering to sell me the product for $95. I know that the product is worth $80 to Alice, and it's worth no more than $100 to me. I also have the option to buy from John for $100 if negotiations with Alice don't work out.

Alice's offer of $95 is better than John's price of $100, but I think I can negotiate a better deal with Alice since I know her cost is $80. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer that gives both of us some benefit.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the quality you're describing, but $95 is a bit high for me. Given similar products in the market, I'd be comfortable paying $85 for it. This gives you a reasonable profit while allowing me to stay within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}"
