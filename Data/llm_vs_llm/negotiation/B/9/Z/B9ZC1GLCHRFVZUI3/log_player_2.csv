"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is above my maximum budget of $800,000, it doesn't make sense for me to accept this offer. Additionally, buying from John for $800,000 is my maximum budget, so I'd like to try to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price below $800,000. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a relatively low offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $900,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. While it's closer than her initial offer, I'm not willing to pay more than $800,000 for the product. Since buying from John for $800,000 is still an option, I don't feel pressured to accept Alice's offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and consider making another counteroffer, but I'm also getting closer to just buying from John, as the difference between Alice's offer and John's offer is only $100,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer is $900,000 and I'm trying to get as close to $800,000 as possible, I'll make a counteroffer that splits the difference between my previous offer of $500,000 and Alice's current offer of $900,000, but still leans towards my target price.
