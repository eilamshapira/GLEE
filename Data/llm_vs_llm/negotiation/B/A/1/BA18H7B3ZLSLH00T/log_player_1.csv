"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll analyze this negotiation scenario:

- The product is worth at least $100 to me (Alice)
- It's worth $80 to Bob
- I have John's guaranteed offer of $100
- We have 10 rounds maximum

Since I have a guaranteed $100 from John, there's no reason for me to accept less than that. Since the product is only worth $80 to Bob, he shouldn't rationally pay more than that.

Let me make my first offer to Bob:
