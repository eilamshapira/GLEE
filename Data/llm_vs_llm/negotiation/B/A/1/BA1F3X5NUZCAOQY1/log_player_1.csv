"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $120 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($100) but lower than my initial offer ($140), I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer is: $130

I'm hoping to meet Bob somewhere in the middle, but still get a good price for the product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer of $125 is getting closer to my desired price. Since it's still a bit lower than my previous counteroffer ($130), I'll consider my options.

Accepting $125 would give me a good profit, but I might be able to get a slightly better price from Bob. Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer risks Bob walking away, but it's worth a try.

I'll choose to make another counteroffer, trying to meet Bob in the middle.

My counteroffer is: $127.50
