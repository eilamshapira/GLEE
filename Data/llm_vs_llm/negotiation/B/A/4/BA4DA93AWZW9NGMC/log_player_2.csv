"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering you a fantastic product that I believe you will love. I can let it go for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $100 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $140
3. John is willing to sell it for $100
4. If I accept Alice's offer, I'll pay $40 more than the product's worth to me
5. If I buy from John, I'll pay exactly what the product is worth to me

Since Alice's offer ($140) is significantly higher than both:
- The product's value to me ($100)
- John's price ($100)

The logical choice is to buy from John, as this gives me the best value for my money.
