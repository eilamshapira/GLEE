"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I see the value of the product differently. I'm willing to purchase it for $6000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must say that $6000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $11500. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I need to stick to my budget. I'm willing to raise my offer to $7000.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for raising your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $7000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with at this point, but I'm still open to further discussions.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm also willing to move a bit more towards your price point. How about we settle for $7500?",7500.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Bob. I appreciate the incremental increases in your offer. However, I still believe the product's value is not being fully reflected in your offer. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $10000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",10000.0,Alice,7,
