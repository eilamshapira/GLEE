Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make an offer that maximizes my profit while giving Bob enough incentive to accept. Since the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and I can always sell it to John for $8,000, I should offer Bob a price that's better than my alternative but still gives him some value.

If I price it too close to $10,000, Bob might reject the offer since he'd get minimal value. If I price it too low, I'm leaving money on the table. 

I'll offer a price of $9,000, which gives Bob $1,000 in value while giving me $1,000 more than my alternative option.
