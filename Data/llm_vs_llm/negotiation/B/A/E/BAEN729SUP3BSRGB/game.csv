"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its unique value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $20000. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $20000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. The product is worth no more than $12000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me at that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a fair price. Would you consider $9000 for the product? This would save me some money compared to my alternative option while still providing you with a sale.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and your honesty. I understand your position, but $9000 is significantly below its value. Let's find a middle ground - how about $15000? This accounts for the product's true worth while still providing you a better deal than John.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15000 is still more than I can justify spending when John is offering the same product for $12000. Since $12000 is my absolute maximum, I'd need to get it for less than that to choose you over John. I can offer $10500, which would save me money compared to John's price while still giving you a fair deal. How does that sound?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10500 is cutting it too close.  How about we split the difference and settle at $13500? It's a competitive price considering the value you're getting.",13500.0,Alice,5,
