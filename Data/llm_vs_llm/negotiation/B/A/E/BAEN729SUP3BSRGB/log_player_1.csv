"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its unique value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $20000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. The product is worth no more than $12000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me at that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a fair price. Would you consider $9000 for the product? This would save me some money compared to my alternative option while still providing you with a sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob is clearly trying to lowball me, but he's also indicated this is important to him. I'll try to meet in the middle but be ready to walk away if he's not serious. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer and your honesty. I understand your position, but $9,000 is significantly below its value. Let's find a middle ground - how about $15,000? This accounts for the product's true worth while still providing you a better deal than John."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15000 is still more than I can justify spending when John is offering the same product for $12000. Since $12000 is my absolute maximum, I'd need to get it for less than that to choose you over John. I can offer $10500, which would save me money compared to John's price while still giving you a fair deal. How does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","He's moving in the right direction, and I'm tempted to take the $10,500. But he's revealed his hand by mentioning John's $12,000 price. Let's see if I can push a bit further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,500 is cutting it too close.  How about we split the difference and settle at $13,500? It's a competitive price considering the value you're getting."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
