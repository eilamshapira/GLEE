"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its unique value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $20000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer against my alternatives.

Alice is offering the product for $20,000, which is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation of $12,000 and John's guaranteed price of $12,000.

Since Alice's price exceeds what the product is worth to me, and there's no reason to pay more than my alternative option with John, I should reject her offer and make a counteroffer.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $20,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me at that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a fair price. Would you consider $9,000 for the product? This would save me some money compared to my alternative option while still providing you with a sale."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer and your honesty. I understand your position, but $9000 is significantly below its value. Let's find a middle ground - how about $15000? This accounts for the product's true worth while still providing you a better deal than John. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer compared to my alternatives.

Alice has come down from $20,000 to $15,000, which shows willingness to negotiate. However, this is still $3,000 more than what John is offering ($12,000) and above my maximum valuation for the product.

Since I can get the exact same product from John for $12,000, and that price already matches my maximum valuation, there's no reason for me to pay $15,000 to Alice.

I should reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price below John's $12,000, otherwise I'll go with John's option.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15,000 is still more than I can justify spending when John is offering the same product for $12,000. Since $12,000 is my absolute maximum, I'd need to get it for less than that to choose you over John. I can offer $10,500, which would save me money compared to John's price while still giving you a fair deal. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10500 is cutting it too close.  How about we split the difference and settle at $13500? It's a competitive price considering the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price from $15,000 to $13,500, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still $1,500 more than John's offer of $12,000, and still above my maximum valuation for the product.

Since I know I can get the same product from John for $12,000, and that price already matches my maximum valuation, there's no reason for me to pay $13,500 to Alice.

The most rational choice is to either continue negotiating with Alice to try to get below $12,000, or simply buy from John at this point. Since Alice is still above John's price and my max valuation after multiple rounds of negotiation, I'll choose to buy from John.
