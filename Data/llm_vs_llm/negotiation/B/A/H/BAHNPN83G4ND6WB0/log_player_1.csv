Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this pricing decision:

1. The product is worth at least $12,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed fallback option of selling to John for $12,000
3. Bob's valuation is unknown, but if it's higher than $12,000, I should try to capture some of that value
4. Setting the price too high risks losing the sale to Bob
5. Setting the price too low leaves money on the table

Given these factors, I'll set a price that gives me a good premium over my guaranteed $12,000 while still being potentially acceptable to Bob.
