"Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Given that Alice's offer is $145, and I know that the product is worth $80 to her, this gives me room to negotiate a better price. John's price of $150 is my fallback option, but Alice is already offering me $5 less than that.

I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get an even better price.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has lowered her price from $145 to $135, which is a good sign that she's willing to negotiate. This is already $15 less than John's price of $150. However, since the product is worth $80 to her, there may still be room to negotiate a better price.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.
