Send your offer to Bob.,"After careful consideration, I need to determine an appropriate price to offer Bob for my product. 

Since the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at exactly $8,000, I should set my price above $8,000 to make it worthwhile to sell to Bob instead.

I don't know how much Bob values the product, so I'll set a price that gives me a reasonable profit above my minimum acceptable value, but not so high that it's likely to be rejected. A 25% markup seems reasonable.
