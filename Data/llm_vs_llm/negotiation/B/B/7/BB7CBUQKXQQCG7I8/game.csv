"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $7000, considering the product's value and my own financial constraints.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget concerns, but $7000 is too low. Given the product's quality and features, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to offer it to you for $16000.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we try $8000? It's a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal if we can agree on this.",8000.0,Bob,4,
