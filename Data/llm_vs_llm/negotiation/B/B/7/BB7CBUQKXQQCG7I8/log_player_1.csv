"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you my product. Considering its value and quality, I'm offering it to you for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $7000, considering the product's value and my own financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $7,000, I have to decide if I want to accept it, reject it and counteroffer, or sell to John.

Considering the product's value to me is $12,000, and Bob's offer is significantly lower, I will **reject** the offer and try to negotiate further. Selling to John is always an option, but I want to try and get a better price from Bob first.

So my decision is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for Round 3:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget concerns, but $7,000 is too low. Given the product's quality and features, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to offer it to you for $16,000."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we try $8000? It's a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is now $8,000. This is the same as the product's value to him. I need to decide between accepting this offer, rejecting it and making another counteroffer, or selling to John.

Since I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, I should not accept $8,000. Now, I need to decide if it is worth continuing to negotiate with Bob, or to sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000. The negotiation is becoming risky since I do not know what Bob will offer next. If I continue with the negotiations, Bob might offer an amount even less than $8,000. Therefore, I will choose to sell the product to John for $12,000.

So my decision is:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
