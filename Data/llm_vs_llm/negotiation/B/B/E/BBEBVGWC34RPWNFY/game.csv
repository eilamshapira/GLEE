"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of the product, $1150000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to offer $1050000 for it. This reflects a fair price that considers both our interests. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $1050000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. However, considering the product's exceptional value, I'm not quite ready to meet you at that price point. I'm willing to make a concession and offer the product to you for $1120000. This price still reflects the product's worth, but also shows my commitment to finding a middle ground. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement soon.",1120000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1120000 is still a bit higher than where I can comfortably land.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1085000 for the product. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget. I'm hopeful you'll accept this offer.",1085000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $1085000. I appreciate your suggestion to split the difference, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to your offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This price is closer to the midpoint of our initial offers, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm hopeful this will be the final step in our negotiation, and we can shake hands on a deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
