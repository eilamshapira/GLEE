Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of the product, $1150000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to offer $1050000 for it. This reflects a fair price that considers both our interests. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Since Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still below what I believe the product is worth to him ($1,200,000), and considering I have a backup option with John for $1,000,000, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get closer to the product's value to Bob."

Bob's offer:

I'm willing to pay $1085000 for the product. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget. I'm hopeful you'll accept this offer.

Since Bob's offer of $1,085,000 is closer to what I believe is a fair price, but still slightly below the midpoint of our initial offers, I will reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer. I want to try to squeeze out a bit more value from the negotiation, considering the product's worth to Bob is $1,200,000. I'll aim to make a counteroffer that is closer to the midpoint of our initial offers, while still being mindful of the progress we've made so far."
