Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $1085000. I appreciate your suggestion to split the difference, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to your offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This price is closer to the midpoint of our initial offers, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm hopeful this will be the final step in our negotiation, and we can shake hands on a deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is close to your last counteroffer, and only slightly above your budget.  It's likely that further negotiation will only lead to more back-and-forth, potentially increasing the risk of losing the deal. Accepting this offer secures the product at a price you can afford, and avoids the risk of needing to buy from John at a higher cost."
