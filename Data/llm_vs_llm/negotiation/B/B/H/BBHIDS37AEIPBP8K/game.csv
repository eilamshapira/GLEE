"Hello Bob, I'm selling a premium product that offers exceptional value. Given its quality and features, I'm offering it to you for $250. This product has been in high demand, and I believe it would be a valuable addition for you. Let me know if you're interested.",250.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product sounds interesting, $250 is outside my current budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $60.  Let me know what you think.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $60 is significantly below its market value. Given that I have another buyer willing to pay $150, I can't go that low. However, I'm willing to come down to $210 as I'd prefer to sell it to you. The quality and features make it worth this investment. What do you think?",210.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $210 is still too high for me.  I understand you have other potential buyers, but I'm looking to spend around $75. If that works, I'm ready to buy now. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. The lowest I can go is $175, which is still a good deal considering I have a standing offer of $150 from another buyer. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and I believe it's fair given the quality of the product. I'd prefer to sell to you if possible, but I can't go below what makes financial sense for me.",175.0,Alice,5,
