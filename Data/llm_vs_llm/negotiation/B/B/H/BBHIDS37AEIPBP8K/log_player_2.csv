Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $60 is significantly below its market value. Given that I have another buyer willing to pay $150, I can't go that low. However, I'm willing to come down to $210 as I'd prefer to sell it to you. The quality and features make it worth this investment. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. The lowest I can go is $175, which is still a good deal considering I have a standing offer of $150 from another buyer. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and I believe it's fair given the quality of the product. I'd prefer to sell to you if possible, but I can't go below what makes financial sense for me.
