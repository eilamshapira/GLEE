"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is only worth $100 to me, so I won't accept an offer of $140. Since I can buy from John for $100, I won't agree to pay more than that. I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 90}

I'll offer $90 for the product. This is below both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100), giving me some potential savings. Since the product is worth $120 to Alice, this still allows her to adjust the price upward in negotiation while potentially giving me a better deal than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $130 as it's still well above both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). Alice has only reduced her price by $10 from her initial offer, suggesting we're still far from reaching a mutually acceptable price. I'll continue negotiating and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 95}

I'll increase my offer slightly to $95. This shows some flexibility in negotiation while still keeping the price below my maximum value and John's price. It's also closer to Alice's cost ($120), which might make it more appealing to her. If Alice doesn't accept this or come back with a reasonable counter, I can always fall back on John's $100 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll buy from John instead. Alice's offer of $120 is still above my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). Even though Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, she's now at her cost price ($120) and likely won't go much lower. Since I can get the same product from John for $100, which matches my maximum value, it's best to take that option rather than continue negotiating with Alice."
