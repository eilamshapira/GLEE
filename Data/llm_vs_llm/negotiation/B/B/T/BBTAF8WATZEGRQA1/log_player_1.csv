I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, leaving room for negotiation. Let's see what Bob's response is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price, but still aiming for a profit.  $1,400,000 is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if Bob is ready to meet me halfway."
