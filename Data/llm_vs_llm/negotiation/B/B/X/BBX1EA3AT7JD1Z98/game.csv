"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $90 is a bit too low for me considering the product's quality and value. I can come down to $110, which I believe is a fair price that works for both of us. This still represents a significant discount from my initial offer.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $110 is still a bit high for me. Could you go down to $100? I think that would be a great deal for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
