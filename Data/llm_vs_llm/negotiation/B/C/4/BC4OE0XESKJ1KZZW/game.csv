"Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer, $7000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold. The product has significant value, and I can't go below $8500. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer and represents excellent value given the product's quality and market worth. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. I'd like to propose $7750 as a potential purchase price. This represents a compromise and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring the product.",7750.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your attempt to find a middle ground. However, I need to be transparent that I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at $8000. Given this alternative, I can offer you the product at $8200, which is very close to my bottom line. This still gives you an excellent value considering the product's worth of $10000 to you. Would you be willing to accept this offer?",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you have another potential buyer, but I'm still interested in purchasing the product from you. Considering your new offer of $8200, I'd like to propose a price of $7900. This is a serious offer, and I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can agree on this price. I believe it's a fair compromise, given the product's value to me and the alternative of buying from John for $10000.",7900.0,Bob,6,
