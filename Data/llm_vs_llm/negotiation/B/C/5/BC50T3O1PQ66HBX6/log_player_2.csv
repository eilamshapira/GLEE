"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you this exclusive product for $12000. It’s a top-of-the-line asset designed to offer exceptional value, and I believe it will serve you very well. If this price works for you, let me know and we can finalize the details. Otherwise, I’ll be proceeding with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll analyze this situation:

- Alice is offering the product for $12,000
- The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $15,000
- My goal is to save as much money as possible while getting the product

Alice's offer ($12,000) is $3,000 less than John's price ($15,000), which means I would save $3,000 by accepting Alice's offer. Since the product is worth up to $15,000 to me and Alice's price is below that threshold, accepting her offer is the rational choice to maximize my savings.
