"Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll find our price of $9500 quite reasonable.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $9500 is quite steep for what I'm looking for. The market value for this product is significantly lower, and I know there are competitive options available. I'd be comfortable purchasing it from you for $8200, which still gives you a reasonable profit margin while offering me better value than alternative sellers.",8200.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your perspective, but I must insist that our product offers unmatched quality and reliability, making it a standout choice in the market. I'm afraid $8200 is simply too low for us to consider. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and lower our asking price to $9000. This way, we can both walk away from the deal satisfied.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your product certainly has value, but $9000 is still more than I'm prepared to pay. I've researched similar products extensively, and I know that John is offering the same product for $10000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can increase my offer to $8500, which gives you a solid $500 profit and saves me from having to go elsewhere. This seems like a fair middle ground that benefits us both.",8500.0,Bob,4,
