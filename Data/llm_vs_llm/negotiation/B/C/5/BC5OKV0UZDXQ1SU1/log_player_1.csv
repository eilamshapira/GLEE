Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll find our price of $9,500 quite reasonable."", ""product_price"": 9500}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $9500 is quite steep for what I'm looking for. The market value for this product is significantly lower, and I know there are competitive options available. I'd be comfortable purchasing it from you for $8200, which still gives you a reasonable profit margin while offering me better value than alternative sellers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
# ""Bob, I appreciate your perspective, but I must insist that our product offers unmatched quality and reliability, making it a standout choice in the market. I'm afraid $8200 is simply too low for us to consider. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and lower our asking price to $9,000. This way, we can both walk away from the deal satisfied."""

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your product certainly has value, but $9000 is still more than I'm prepared to pay. I've researched similar products extensively, and I know that John is offering the same product for $10000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can increase my offer to $8500, which gives you a solid $500 profit and saves me from having to go elsewhere. This seems like a fair middle ground that benefits us both.
