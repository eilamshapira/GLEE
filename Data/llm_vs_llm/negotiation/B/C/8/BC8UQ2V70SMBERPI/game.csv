"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that we're still quite far apart in terms of price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for the product. Considering your offer, I'd like to propose a counteroffer that brings us closer together.",2500000.0,Alice,3,

You mentioned another offer at $800000, which suggests to me that you see significant value in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your current offer and the $2500000 I previously mentioned. Let's discuss the possibility of $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
