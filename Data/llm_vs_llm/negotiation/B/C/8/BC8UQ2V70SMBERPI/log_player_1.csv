"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting with a competitive price, considering the product's worth to me."", ""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. Considering the market and my budget, I'm prepared to pay $400000 for the product. Let me know if you'd be willing to negotiate around that figure. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $400,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me, and I believe I can get a better deal. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still an option, but I'd like to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob first."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that we're still quite far apart in terms of price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your position and willingness to negotiate. Given that my budget is quite limited and considering that I have another offer available at $800000, I can stretch a little further. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $525000. I hope we can meet at this number. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $525,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get a better deal. Since Bob mentioned he has another offer at $800,000, it suggests he's willing to pay more, and I'd like to explore that further. I'll make another counteroffer to try and bridge the gap. Selling to John for $1,500,000 remains a safe option, but I'm willing to take a bit more risk to see if I can get a higher price from Bob."

Round 5

You mentioned another offer at $800,000, which suggests to me that you see significant value in the product.
