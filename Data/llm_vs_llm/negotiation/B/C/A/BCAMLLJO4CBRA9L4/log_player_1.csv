Round 3

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one, to show that I'm willing to compromise. However, I'll still aim for a price that's closer to my initial target.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Considering that we're halfway through the negotiation rounds, I think this is a reasonable price. Accepting this offer would also ensure that I get a good price for the product, rather than risking further negotiations that might not yield a better result.
