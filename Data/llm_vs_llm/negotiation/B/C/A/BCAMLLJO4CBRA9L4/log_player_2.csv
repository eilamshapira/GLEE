"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,200,000
2. Alice's offer is $1,150,000, which is below my maximum
3. John's fixed price is $1,200,000
4. Alice's cost is $800,000, so there's significant room for negotiation
5. We have 10 rounds available for negotiation

Since Alice's initial offer ($1,150,000) is still quite high and we have plenty of negotiation rounds left, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. There's potential to get a better price since Alice's cost is much lower at $800,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's cost is $800,000 and my maximum value is $1,200,000, I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation. A reasonable starting point would be closer to Alice's cost plus a moderate profit margin.

{""product_price"": 900000}

This offer:
1. Gives Alice a $100,000 profit over her cost
2. Is significantly lower than her initial offer of $1,150,000
3. Leaves plenty of room for negotiation to reach a middle ground
4. Could save me up to $300,000 compared to buying from John"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let's analyze the progress:

1. Alice's first offer: $1,150,000
2. My counteroffer: $900,000
3. Alice's new offer: $1,100,000

This shows:
- Alice has reduced her price by $50,000
- There's still a $200,000 gap between her offer and my last counteroffer
- Her offer is still $100,000 less than John's price
- We still have 7 more rounds for negotiation
- There's still significant room between her cost ($800,000) and current offer

Since Alice has shown willingness to reduce the price and we have several rounds left, I should continue negotiating to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice moved down $50,000 from her initial offer, I should also move up from my initial counteroffer to show good faith in the negotiation. I'll aim for a point that's still significantly below her last offer but higher than my previous bid.

{""product_price"": 950000}

This counteroffer:
1. Is $50,000 higher than my previous offer, matching Alice's $50,000 reduction
2. Still gives Alice a good profit ($150,000 above her cost)
3. Is significantly below Alice's last offer of $1,100,000
4. Maintains room for further negotiation
5. Shows I'm willing to move in her direction while still seeking a good deal"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let's analyze the negotiation progress:

1. Alice: $1,150,000
2. Me: $900,000
3. Alice: $1,100,000 (-$50,000)
4. Me: $950,000 (+$50,000)
5. Alice: $1,075,000 (-$25,000)

Positive signs:
- Alice continues to lower her price
- Each reduction shows willingness to negotiate
- Still $125,000 less than John's price
- We still have 5 rounds left

However:
- Alice's reductions are getting smaller ($50,000 â†’ $25,000)
- The gap between our positions is still large ($125,000)
- There's risk of Alice growing frustrated if we don't make significant progress

Since Alice is still making meaningful reductions and we have several rounds left, I'll continue negotiating.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice reduced her price by $25,000, I should also show continued willingness to move toward a middle ground. Her last offer was $1,075,000 and my last offer was $950,000, with her cost at $800,000.

{""product_price"": 1000000}

This counteroffer:
1. Represents a $50,000 increase from my previous offer ($950,000)
2. Shows I'm willing to make a larger move than Alice's last $25,000 reduction
3. Is a psychologically significant number (1 million)
4. Still gives room for negotiation
5. Provides Alice with a $200,000 profit over her cost
6. Is $75,000 below Alice's last offer, potentially leading to a middle ground
7. Maintains a significant savings compared to John's price ($1,200,000)"
