"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John offers.  There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a low offer gives us room to negotiate upwards. While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it puts the pressure on her to move closer to your desired price range."
