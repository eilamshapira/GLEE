"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offer ($120) is equal to John's price ($120)
2. Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, there's room for negotiation
3. We have 10 rounds available, so there's no immediate pressure to accept
4. I can always fall back to John's offer if negotiations with Alice fail

Given these factors, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. There's potential to get a better price from Alice since her cost is $100, and I risk nothing since John's offer ($120) will still be available.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, I'll start with a reasonable counteroffer that gives her some profit but is significantly better for me than the $120 price:

{""product_price"": 108}

This offer would give Alice an $8 profit while saving me $12 compared to John's price. It's a fair starting point that shows I'm willing to negotiate but also want a better deal than the current offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has moved down from $120 to $115, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, since her cost is $100, there's still room for a better price. We still have several rounds left, and I maintain the safety of John's $120 offer as a backup.

The $5 reduction from her initial offer suggests she might be willing to go lower. Since we're not under immediate pressure, I'll reject this offer and try another counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down to $115 from $120, I'll adjust my previous offer slightly upward from $108 to show I'm also willing to be flexible, but still aim for a good deal:

{""product_price"": 110}

This offer would give Alice a $10 profit while saving me $10 compared to John's price. It's a reasonable compromise between her last offer of $115 and my previous offer of $108. It shows I'm willing to meet her partway while still seeking a better deal than the current offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let's analyze this latest offer:

1. Alice has moved down from $115 to $112, showing continued willingness to negotiate
2. The price is now $8 less than John's offer ($120)
3. Alice's movement in price is getting smaller ($5 first reduction, now $3)
4. We're halfway through our rounds (5 out of 10)
5. Risk of Alice getting frustrated and stopping negotiations increases with each rejection

Given that Alice's concessions are getting smaller and we're halfway through our rounds, this $112 offer is actually quite reasonable. It gives her a modest profit while saving me $8 compared to John's price. While we might potentially get a slightly better price by continuing to negotiate, the potential benefit doesn't outweigh the risk of losing this deal.
