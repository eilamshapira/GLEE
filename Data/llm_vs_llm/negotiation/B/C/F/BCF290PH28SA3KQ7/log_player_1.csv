Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my position carefully here. I know the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price. However, Bob might value it higher, so there's an opportunity to make more.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll offer it at a significantly higher price than my minimum acceptable value, but not so high that it would immediately seem unreasonable.
