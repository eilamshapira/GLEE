"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $50 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for it.  Could you meet me halfway at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down from $200, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of your new offer and my previous offer, so how about $87.50?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference between your offer and my last one?  Would you do $106?",106.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Since we're getting closer, I'm willing to make a slightly higher offer. How about $95? It's still a bit lower than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving up on the price.  To be honest, I have another buyer willing to pay $150, so I can't go any lower than $100.  This is my final offer.",100.0,Alice,7,
