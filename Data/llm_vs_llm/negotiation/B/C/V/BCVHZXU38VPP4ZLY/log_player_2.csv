"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is higher than our maximum budget and what John is offering. We should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a strong counter-offer significantly below both Alice's initial offer and our maximum budget. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling that we're looking for a fair deal."
