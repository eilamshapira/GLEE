Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $110."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I think $110 is a bit high for my budget. I'd like to counter with $90. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counter offer with a more moderate price reduction to try to find a middle ground between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is too low considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle - I can offer it to you for $100, which is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}"
