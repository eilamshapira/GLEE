"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since the product is worth $12,000 to me and Alice's offer is $11,500, which is less than what I'm willing to pay, I'll consider rejecting the offer to see if I can get a better deal. However, the difference between Alice's offer and my maximum budget is only $500, which might not be worth the risk of losing the deal or having to negotiate further.

Given that Alice's initial offer is already close to my maximum budget and considering the product's value to Alice is $10,000, there's a potential for further negotiation. But, starting with a counteroffer might give me a better insight into Alice's flexibility with the price.

For now, I'll choose to reject the offer and make a counteroffer to test the waters.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's initial offer of $11,500 and the product's value to her being $10,000, I'll aim to make a counteroffer that is reasonable and potentially acceptable to both parties. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'll start by offering a price that is lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than the product's value to her, to ensure the negotiation remains viable.

My counteroffer will be $10,750. This price is above Alice's valuation of the product, which should make it attractive to her, and it's also below my maximum budget, allowing me to save some money compared to Alice's initial offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has made a new offer of $11,250 after rejecting my counteroffer of $10,750. This indicates that she is willing to negotiate further and has moved closer to my desired price range.

Given that Alice's new offer of $11,250 is still below my maximum budget of $12,000, and considering that she has already come down from her initial offer of $11,500, I believe there might be some room for further negotiation. However, the difference between her current offer and my previous counteroffer is $500, which suggests that we are getting closer to a mutually acceptable price.

At this point, accepting Alice's offer of $11,250 would save me $750 compared to buying from John for $12,000. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'll consider making another counteroffer to see if I can get an even better deal. But, I need to be cautious not to push Alice too far, as she might decide not to sell at a price that's too low for her.

I'll make a new counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one, aiming to meet Alice somewhere in the middle. My next counteroffer will be $11,000. This price is still below Alice's current offer and above her initial valuation of the product, making it a potentially reasonable compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my counteroffer is $11,000."
