"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to your company. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. This is a price point that allows for both of us to achieve a profitable deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit above what I'm willing to spend. I'd like to counter with $750000. Let me know if this works for you.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $900000 to facilitate this deal. This price still leaves us both with a profitable margin.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $800000? I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
