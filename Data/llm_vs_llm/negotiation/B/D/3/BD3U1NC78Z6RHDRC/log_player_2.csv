"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is less than my maximum budget of $1,200,000, I am willing to consider it. However, I also believe that Alice's minimum price of $1,000,000 leaves room for negotiation. Therefore, I will reject Alice's initial offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of getting a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable considering her minimum price. Since Alice's minimum price is $1,000,000, I'll aim for a midpoint between that and her initial offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has lowered her price to $1,120,000, which is still within my budget of $1,200,000. However, I believe I can still get a better deal since Alice's minimum price is $1,000,000. The difference between Alice's current offer and my previous counteroffer is $12,500, which suggests that we are getting closer to a mutually acceptable price.

I'll reject Alice's current offer and make another counteroffer, trying to meet in the middle.

Next, I will send a new counteroffer to Alice.
