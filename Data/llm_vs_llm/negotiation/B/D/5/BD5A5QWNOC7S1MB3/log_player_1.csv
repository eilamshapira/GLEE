"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I am interested, but I think $11500 is a bit high. Considering the product's value to you, I am willing to offer $11000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let me send a counteroffer. While $11,000 is closer to my target, I believe we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'll propose $11,300, which is a reasonable reduction from my initial offer while still providing good value for the product's worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest and counteroffer, Bob. While I've reduced my initial price, I believe $11,300 represents a fair middle ground that would benefit both of us. This is a significant reduction from my first offer while still reflecting the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 11300}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I'm still hoping to save some money. I can offer $11150. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $11,150. This is a reasonable compromise that's well above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and represents a good deal for both parties. While I might have gotten slightly more by continuing to negotiate, there's also the risk of Bob walking away, leaving me with only John's $10,000 offer. This is a satisfactory outcome."
