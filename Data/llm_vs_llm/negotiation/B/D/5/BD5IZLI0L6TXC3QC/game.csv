"Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it for $250. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice! Thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but $250 is well above my budget. I can offer you $50 for it. Let me know if this works for you.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $50 is significantly below the product's value. I understand $250 might be above your budget, so I can reduce it to $200. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. What do you think about this offer?",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks, Alice, for adjusting the price. However, $200 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $60, as I need to be mindful of my financial constraints. Please consider this offer.",60.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but I need to be direct: $60 is still far below the product's market value. I can't go below $175, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. If this is still beyond your budget, I understand, but I need to be transparent that I can't consider offers below this amount.",175.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your transparency. My budget is quite limited, so $175 is unfortunately still not feasible for me. The most I can offer is $70. Let me know if this could work.",70.0,Bob,6,
