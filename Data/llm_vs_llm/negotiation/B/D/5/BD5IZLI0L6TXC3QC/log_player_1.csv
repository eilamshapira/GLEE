"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it for $250. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! Thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but $250 is well above my budget. I can offer you $50 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $50 is far too low, even below my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $50 is significantly below the product's value. I understand $250 might be above your budget, so I can reduce it to $200. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. What do you think about this offer?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks, Alice, for adjusting the price. However, $200 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $60, as I need to be mindful of my financial constraints. Please consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still far too low, and he's only increasing his offers by very small amounts. While I'll make one more attempt to negotiate, if this pattern continues, I may need to consider John's guaranteed offer of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but I need to be direct: $60 is still far below the product's market value. I can't go below $175, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. If this is still beyond your budget, I understand, but I need to be transparent that I can't consider offers below this amount."", ""product_price"": 175}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your transparency. My budget is quite limited, so $175 is unfortunately still not feasible for me. The most I can offer is $70. Let me know if this could work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've decided to sell to John for $150. It's clear that Bob's budget is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and his small incremental increases ($50 -> $60 -> $70) suggest we won't reach a mutually acceptable price. John's offer of $150 is much better than continuing this negotiation."
