"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you. I understand it's worth $1500000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it at the same price. This is a fair deal as you're getting the full value of the product. I should mention that I already have another buyer, John, who has agreed to purchase it at $1500000, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity. Would you like to proceed with this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
