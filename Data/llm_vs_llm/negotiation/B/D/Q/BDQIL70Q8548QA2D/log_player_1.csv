Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what price to offer Bob. 

Since the product is worth $80 to Bob, he won't accept any offer above $80. 

If Bob rejects my offer, I know I can sell it to John for $100, which is the minimum value the product has to me.

Since Bob can only accept offers at or below $80, and I can get $100 from John, it makes more economic sense for me to not make a deal with Bob.

I'll offer a price that ensures I can sell to John instead:

{""product_price"": 90}"
