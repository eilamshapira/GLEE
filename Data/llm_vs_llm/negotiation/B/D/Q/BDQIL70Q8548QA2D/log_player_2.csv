"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I should analyze this offer carefully:

- The product is worth at most $80 to me
- Alice is offering to sell it for $90
- John is willing to sell the same product for $80

Since Alice's offer ($90) exceeds what the product is worth to me ($80), and I can get the exact same product from John for $80, I should choose to buy from John. This saves me $10 compared to Alice's offer.
