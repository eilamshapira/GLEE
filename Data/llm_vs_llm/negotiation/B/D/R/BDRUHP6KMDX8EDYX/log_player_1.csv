"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair price."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to spend even less. What about this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get a better price than $90. Selling to John for $80 is also not ideal, as I believe the product is worth more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend less, but I still think the product is worth more than $90. How about we meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe we're almost there, Alice. I really want to buy the product from you, but I need to save as much money as I can.  I'll offer a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Although Bob's offer of $97 is getting closer to what I'm looking for, I still believe the product is worth more. I'll try to negotiate a bit more. Selling to John for $80 is still not an option, as Bob's offer is already higher than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your persistence, Bob. We're getting close, but I still need to get a bit more for the product. How about we try $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we're almost there, Alice. What about this price? It might be a price that works for both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $99 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $100, and I think it's a fair price considering the negotiation process. Accepting this offer will allow me to close the deal and earn a good amount for the product. Rejecting it and trying to negotiate further might risk losing the sale, and selling to John for $80 is not a better option at this point."
