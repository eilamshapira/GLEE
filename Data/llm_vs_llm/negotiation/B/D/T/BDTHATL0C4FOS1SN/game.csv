"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $11000 is quite high for this product. Given market conditions and product value, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me. I hope we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, after considering your counteroffer, I'm willing to lower my price to $10000. This price takes into account both our interests and I believe it's a fair compromise. I look forward to your positive response.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price. While $10000 is better, I still feel it's a bit high. I can offer $9500, which is a fair increase from my previous offer and would give you a healthy profit margin. This represents a good middle ground between our positions.",9500.0,Bob,4,
