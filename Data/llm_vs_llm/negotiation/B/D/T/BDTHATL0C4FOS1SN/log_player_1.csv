Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $11000 is quite high for this product. Given market conditions and product value, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me. I hope we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price. While $10000 is better, I still feel it's a bit high. I can offer $9500, which is a fair increase from my previous offer and would give you a healthy profit margin. This represents a good middle ground between our positions.
