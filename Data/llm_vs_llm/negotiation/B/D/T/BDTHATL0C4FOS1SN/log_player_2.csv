"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11000. This is a great opportunity for you to purchase a product that I know is worth a lot to you. I'm looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $12,000
2. Alice's offer is $11,000
3. The product is worth $8,000 to Alice
4. I can always buy from John for $12,000 as a backup

Alice's offer of $11,000 is high, especially considering the product is worth $8,000 to her. Since I can make a counteroffer, it makes sense to reject this initial offer and try to negotiate a better price. Even if negotiations fail, I can still buy from John at $12,000, so I have nothing to lose by negotiating.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's above Alice's cost but significantly below her initial offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $11,000 is quite high for this product. Given market conditions and product value, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me. I hope we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after considering your counteroffer, I'm willing to lower my price to $10000. This price takes into account both our interests and I believe it's a fair compromise. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice has moved down from $11,000 to $10,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. The product costs Alice $8,000
3. I can still get it from John for $12,000
4. There's still room for negotiation as Alice has a $2,000 margin at current price

While $10,000 is better than the initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. Since Alice showed flexibility by reducing her price by $1,000, it makes sense to continue negotiating. The worst case remains that I can buy from John at $12,000, so I still have negotiating leverage.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $1,000 from her initial offer, I'll move up a reasonable amount from my previous offer to show good faith in the negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price. While $10,000 is better, I still feel it's a bit high. I can offer $9,500, which is a fair increase from my previous offer and would give you a healthy profit margin. This represents a good middle ground between our positions."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
