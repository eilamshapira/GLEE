"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at $1200000, but that's still quite high for me. I understand the product is valuable, but I'm looking for a better deal. Given the market conditions and considering that the product is worth $800000 to you, I'd like to offer $900000. This would give you a $100000 profit while allowing me to save significantly compared to other options. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your perspective, $900000 is below what I believe is fair for the product given its value to you. I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which I think is a reasonable compromise considering the benefits you'll gain from the product. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for considering my last offer. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I believe $1100000 is a fair price given the significant value the product offers you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we settle at $1050000? This should provide you with substantial savings while ensuring I receive a reasonable return on the product. Let me know if this works for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
