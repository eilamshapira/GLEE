Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at $1200000, but that's still quite high for me. I understand the product is valuable, but I'm looking for a better deal. Given the market conditions and considering that the product is worth $800000 to you, I'd like to offer $900000. This would give you a $100000 profit while allowing me to save significantly compared to other options. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While I appreciate your perspective, $900,000 is below what I believe is fair for the product given its value to you.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for considering my last offer. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I believe $1,100,000 is a fair price given the significant value the product offers you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we settle at $1,050,000? This should provide you with substantial savings while ensuring I receive a reasonable return on the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
