"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1200000. This is a great opportunity considering the value it brings. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $1,200,000 carefully.

The product is worth up to $1,500,000 to me, and that's also what John would sell it to me for.
Alice's cost for the product is $800,000, so she's trying to make a $400,000 profit with her current offer.

At $1,200,000, I would still save $300,000 compared to buying from John. However, I can likely negotiate a better price with Alice since she has room to lower her price while still making a profit.

It makes sense to reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer, as that gives me the opportunity to save more money.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at $1,200,000, but that's still quite high for me. I understand the product is valuable, but I'm looking for a better deal. Given the market conditions and considering that the product is worth $800,000 to you, I'd like to offer $900,000. This would give you a $100,000 profit while allowing me to save significantly compared to other options. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for considering my last offer. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I believe $1100000 is a fair price given the significant value the product offers you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we settle at $1050000? This should provide you with substantial savings while ensuring I receive a reasonable return on the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $1,200,000 to $1,050,000, which is a $150,000 reduction. This shows she's willing to negotiate and has moved more than halfway toward my counteroffer.

At $1,050,000, I would be saving $450,000 compared to John's price of $1,500,000, which is substantial. Alice would still make a $250,000 profit over her cost of $800,000.

I could try to negotiate further, but Alice has already made a significant concession, and I risk her becoming frustrated if I push too hard. The current offer provides me with good value while still giving Alice a reasonable profit.
