"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I believe will bring you great value. I'm offering it for $20000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $20,000
2. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me (Bob)
3. John is offering the same product for $12,000

Alice's offer ($20,000) is significantly higher than both:
- The product's value to me ($12,000)
- John's alternative offer ($12,000)

Since Alice's price is much higher than both my maximum value and the alternative option, the logical choice is to buy from John.
