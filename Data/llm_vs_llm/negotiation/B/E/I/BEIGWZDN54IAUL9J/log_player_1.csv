Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, my budget is a bit more constrained. I'd be willing to offer $12000 for it, considering the competitive options available to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
