"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a special price of $1600000. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to me and Alice's offer is $1,600,000, which is higher than its worth to me, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,500,000, which is within my budget.
