"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, considering its potential value.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $1000000 is below the product's current market value. I understand my initial offer might have been high, so I'm willing to adjust it to $1650000. This price better reflects the product's true value and potential ROI for your business. Would you consider this more reasonable offer?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While $1650000 is a step in the right direction, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1400000, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also allowing us both to reach an agreement.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
