"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,000,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential return on investment. Would you be interested in proceeding with this offer?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, considering its potential value.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Since Bob's initial offer is quite low, I should continue negotiating to try to get a better price, knowing I always have John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $1,000,000 is below the product's current market value. I understand my initial offer might have been high, so I'm willing to adjust it to $1,650,000. This price better reflects the product's true value and potential ROI for your business. Would you consider this more reasonable offer?"", ""product_price"": 1650000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While $1650000 is a step in the right direction, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1400000, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also allowing us both to reach an agreement.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,400,000. This is a good price that's well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 (John's offer), and Bob has shown reasonable negotiation progress from his initial $1,000,000 offer. Further negotiation might risk losing this good deal, as Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John's lower offer."
