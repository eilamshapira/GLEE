"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a fair price for the product. I'd like to counteroffer at $18000, which is still a great value considering the product's worth.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value you see in the product, my budget is a key factor. I would be comfortable purchasing the product for $9000.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. Considering you've come up from $8000 to $9000, I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. I'd like to counteroffer at $12000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offer. If you're truly interested in the product, I believe this price is reasonable.",12000.0,Alice,5,
