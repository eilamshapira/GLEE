Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I am looking for something within my budget. I am willing to purchase the product for $8000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is below my minimum threshold of $10,000, and I have the option to sell it to John for $10,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I am also interested in exploring if Bob is willing to pay more, so I won't sell it to John just yet. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a fair price for the product. I'd like to counteroffer at $18,000, which is still a great value considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value you see in the product, my budget is a key factor. I would be comfortable purchasing the product for $9000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

However, I notice that Bob is increasing his offer, which suggests that he is interested in the product and may be willing to pay more. I will reject Bob's offer again and see if I can get him to meet my minimum price.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. Considering you've come up from $8,000 to $9,000, I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. I'd like to counteroffer at $12,000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offer. If you're truly interested in the product, I believe this price is reasonable."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
