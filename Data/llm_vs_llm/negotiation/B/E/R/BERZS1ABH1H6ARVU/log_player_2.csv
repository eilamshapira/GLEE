Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price.
