Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","I need to decide between accepting Bob's offer, making a counteroffer, or selling to John.

Bob's offer of $75 is below the minimum value of $100 that the product is worth to me, so accepting it would result in a loss.

Since John is willing to buy the product for $100, which matches my minimum value threshold, selling to John is the most profitable option available to me.
