"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15000? That's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",15000.0,Alice,3,
