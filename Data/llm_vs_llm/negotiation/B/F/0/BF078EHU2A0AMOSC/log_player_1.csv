# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
