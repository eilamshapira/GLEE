Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, considering the options:

I could accept $85 from Bob and make a profit of $5, or I could sell to John for $80. Since I want to earn as much as possible, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","This is a tough one. Bob is offering $80, which is my absolute minimum. I could accept and make no profit. Alternatively, I could try to negotiate further, risking Bob walking away entirely and me only being able to sell to John for $80.

Since I want to maximize profit, and I know the product is worth $100 to Bob, I'm going to try and squeeze out a little more.
