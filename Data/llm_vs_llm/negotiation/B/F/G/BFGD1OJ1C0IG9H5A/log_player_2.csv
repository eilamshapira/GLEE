"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's price ($1,200,000), and it's the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I should reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price with Alice. If negotiations fail, I can always fall back to John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low that it would be considered unreasonable.

{""product_price"": 800000}

This offer is about 67% of my maximum price ($1,200,000). It's low enough to give me room to negotiate upward if needed, but not so low as to be offensive or unrealistic. If Alice counters, we can work towards finding a middle ground that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has significantly reduced her price from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000, which is a substantial improvement and shows she's willing to negotiate. This offer is $200,000 less than John's price, representing significant savings. While there might be a small chance to negotiate an even better price, this is already a very good offer, and pursuing further negotiations might risk losing this opportunity. I'll accept this offer.
