"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $149. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $149. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $149
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to consider my options carefully:

1. Accept Alice's offer: Pay $149 for a product worth no more than $100 to me.
2. Reject Alice's offer.
3. Buy from John for $100: Pay exactly what the product is worth to me.

Since the product is only worth $100 to me, paying $149 would mean losing $49 in value. John's offer at $100 gives me the product at exactly what it's worth to me.
