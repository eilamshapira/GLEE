"Bob, I'm excited to begin this negotiation with you. Given the unique value this product offers, and knowing its worth to you, my initial offer is $1400000. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a price that's closer to its actual worth to me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is far below my bottom line. While I appreciate you engaging in the negotiation, the product truly is worth more. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down significantly to $1300000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $1300000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. Let's discuss a price of $1100000.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I value this product at no less than $1200000, and I know you do too. Meeting exactly in the middle doesn't quite work for me. How about we compromise at $1250000? This is a significant concession on my part.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your concession, but $1250000 is still a bit above what I'm willing to pay. Considering your valuation and my budget, I'm willing to meet you at $1150000. This is a significant stretch for me, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
