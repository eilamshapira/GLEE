Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118

**{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable counteroffer. I want to save as much money as possible, but I also don't want to be so low that Alice immediately rejects it. Given that the product is worth $100 to Alice and $120 to me from John, I will offer a price a bit lower than my maximum willingness to pay and closer to Alice's cost.

**{""product_price"": 110}**"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.
