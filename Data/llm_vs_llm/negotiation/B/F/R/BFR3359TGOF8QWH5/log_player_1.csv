"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer of $50 is significantly below my minimum value of $120. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, there's no reason to accept such a low offer. However, I'll reject and make a counteroffer since there might still be room for a better deal with Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial price but still maintain a price well above my minimum value, giving room for further negotiation while ensuring potential for good profit.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob has only increased his offer by $10 (from $50 to $60), which is still far below my minimum acceptable value of $120. Given that Bob's incremental increase is so small and we're already in round 4, it seems unlikely that we'll reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $120, I'll take that option rather than continue with potentially unproductive negotiations.
