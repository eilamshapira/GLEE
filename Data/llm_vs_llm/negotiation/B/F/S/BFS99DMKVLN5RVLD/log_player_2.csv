"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,500,000
2. Alice's offer is $1,200,000, which is $300,000 less than my maximum value
3. John's fixed price is $1,500,000

Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is a good price, but since this is the first round of negotiation, there might be room to negotiate for an even better price. It would be worth trying to get a lower price through a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice offered $1,200,000, I'll try to negotiate for a significantly lower price while still keeping it reasonable. I'll start with an offer that's 25% lower than her initial offer, which would be $900,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still being a serious offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a very favorable development:

1. Alice's initial offer was $1,200,000
2. After my counteroffer of $900,000, she has come down to $1,000,000
3. This new price is $500,000 less than John's price and $200,000 less than Alice's initial offer
4. The significant drop in price ($200,000) suggests Alice has substantial room in her margins
5. However, pushing too hard might risk losing this already excellent offer

Given that $1,000,000 is a very good price (33% below my maximum value), and we've already achieved a substantial reduction, I'll accept this offer. The risk of losing this favorable price outweighs the potential benefit of trying to negotiate further.
