"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering you this fantastic product for $100. I believe it's a great deal! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me evaluate this offer.

Alice is offering the product for $100, which is below my maximum value of $150. In fact, it's significantly lower, saving me $50 compared to buying from John.

Since this is a good offer already and below my maximum valuation, I should accept it.
