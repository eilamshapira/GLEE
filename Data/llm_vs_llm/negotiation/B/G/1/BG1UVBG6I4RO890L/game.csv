"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price point is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm glad you see its value. However, I must say that $650000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to meet you at a more reasonable price point.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand we're both aiming for a fair deal. While $1050000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant stretch for my budget. Could you consider coming down a bit more, perhaps closer to $750000? I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I can see that you're genuinely interested in the product, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to stay above $900000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",975000.0,Alice,5,
