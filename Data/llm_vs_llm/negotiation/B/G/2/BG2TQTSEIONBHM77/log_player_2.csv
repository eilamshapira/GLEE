"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $150
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $120
4. My goal is to buy the product while saving money

The decision is clear:
1. Alice's offer ($150) is above my maximum value ($120)
2. John's price ($120) matches my maximum value
3. It makes no economic sense to pay $150 when I can get it for $120

Therefore, I should buy from John.
