"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that budget can be a constraint, but I believe the product's value is higher than your offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer that still reflects the product's worth while being more considerate of your budget.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. I'm trying to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $850000, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going.",850000.0,Alice,5,
