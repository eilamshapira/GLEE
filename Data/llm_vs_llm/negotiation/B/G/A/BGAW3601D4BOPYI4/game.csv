"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you today. Based on the market value and the unique features of this product, I'm offering it to you for $18500. This is a competitive price for what you're getting. Would you like to proceed with the purchase?",18500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18500 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $10000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but I need to clarify that $10000 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value, and I already have another buyer willing to pay $12000. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can reduce my initial offer to $15800. This represents a substantial discount from my initial price while reflecting the true value of the product. Would this work for you?",15800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15800 is still outside of my budget. Given that you mentioned another buyer at $12000, I'm willing to match that offer. Would you accept $11000 for the product? This is the highest I can go while staying within my financial limits.",11000.0,Bob,4,
