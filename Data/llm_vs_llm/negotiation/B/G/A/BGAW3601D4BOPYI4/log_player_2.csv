Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but I need to clarify that $10000 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value, and I already have another buyer willing to pay $12000. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can reduce my initial offer to $15800. This represents a substantial discount from my initial price while reflecting the true value of the product. Would this work for you?
