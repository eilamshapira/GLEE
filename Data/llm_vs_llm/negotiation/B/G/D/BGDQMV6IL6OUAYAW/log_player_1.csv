(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $100 since it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $100 as it's significantly below the product's value. However, I can lower my initial price.
