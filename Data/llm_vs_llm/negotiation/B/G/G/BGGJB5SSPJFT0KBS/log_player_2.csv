"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($800,000), I will reject her offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a relatively low offer.

{""product_price"": $600,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $900,000 is still higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($800,000). Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $800,000, I don't see a reason to accept Alice's offer. However, I'm willing to continue negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer decreased from $1,000,000 to $900,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between her last offer and my previous counteroffer. My previous counteroffer was $600,000, so I'll increase it to $750,000, which is still below Alice's last offer of $900,000.

{""product_price"": $750,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $850,000 is very close to the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, but it's still slightly higher. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $800,000, which is $50,000 less than Alice's offer, I think it's better to reject Alice's offer and consider buying from John or making another counteroffer.

However, I'll try to make one more counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to meet me at my target price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer is now $850,000, and I know that she values the product at $800,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is very close to my target price. I'll offer $810,000, which is slightly above my maximum willingness to pay, but still lower than Alice's last offer.

{""product_price"": $810,000}"
