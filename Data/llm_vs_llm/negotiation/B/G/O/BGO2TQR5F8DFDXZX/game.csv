"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $120 exceeds my budget constraint. The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and I actually have another seller (John) who's willing to sell it to me at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better deal. Would you consider $80 for the product? This would give me some savings compared to my alternative option and hopefully still work for you.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your honest feedback and for considering doing business with me. I appreciate your willingness to share information about your alternative option. Given the value of the product and the fact that I have another buyer willing to pay $80, I'm willing to make a compromise. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $80. I'd like to offer it to you for $100, which is the maximum value you mentioned it's worth to you. This way, we can meet at a mutually beneficial price.",100.0,Alice,3,
