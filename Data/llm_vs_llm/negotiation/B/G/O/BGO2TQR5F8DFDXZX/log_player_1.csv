"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its exceptional quality and value, I'm starting with a competitive price. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $120 exceeds my budget constraint. The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and I actually have another seller (John) who's willing to sell it to me at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better deal. Would you consider $80 for the product? This would give me some savings compared to my alternative option and hopefully still work for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your honest feedback and for considering doing business with me. I appreciate your willingness to share information about your alternative option. Given the value of the product and the fact that I have another buyer willing to pay $80, I'm willing to make a compromise. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $80. I'd like to offer it to you for $100, which is the maximum value you mentioned it's worth to you. This way, we can meet at a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 100}"
