"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its exceptional quality and value, I'm starting with a competitive price. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's initial offer of $120 exceeds both the $100 value limit I've set for the product and John's guaranteed price of $100. Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible while getting the product, it doesn't make sense to accept this offer.

I should either make a counteroffer to Alice or buy directly from John. Since I have the opportunity to negotiate with Alice for a potentially better price than John's $100, I'll reject this offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $120 exceeds my budget constraint. The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and I actually have another seller (John) who's willing to sell it to me at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better deal. Would you consider $80 for the product? This would give me some savings compared to my alternative option and hopefully still work for you."", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your honest feedback and for considering doing business with me. I appreciate your willingness to share information about your alternative option. Given the value of the product and the fact that I have another buyer willing to pay $80, I'm willing to make a compromise. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $80. I'd like to offer it to you for $100, which is the maximum value you mentioned it's worth to you. This way, we can meet at a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has now offered the product for $100, which is exactly the same as John's price and matches the maximum value I've set for the product. Since Alice's offer is now equal to John's alternative, there's no advantage to buying from John instead.

I could try to negotiate further with Alice for an even lower price, but there's a risk she might not go lower or could even increase her price if negotiations continue. Since $100 is a fair price that matches my maximum value for the product, I'll accept this offer.
