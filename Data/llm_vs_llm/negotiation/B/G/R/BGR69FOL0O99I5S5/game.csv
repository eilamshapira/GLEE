"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique qualities and potential value to you, I'm initially offering it for $2500000. I believe this price reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing it further.",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand that the product has unique qualities, but the price of $2500000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay a significant amount for the product, but I need to ensure it's within my means. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $500000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. As I mentioned, I have another buyer, John, willing to pay $1200000. However, I'm still interested in exploring a potential agreement with you. How about we meet in the middle at $2000000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $500000 was too low, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle at $2000000 is still a bit steep for me. Considering John's offer of $1200000, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
