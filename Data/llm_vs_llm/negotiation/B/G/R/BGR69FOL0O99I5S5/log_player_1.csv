Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $500000 was too low, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle at $2000000 is still a bit steep for me. Considering John's offer of $1200000, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.
