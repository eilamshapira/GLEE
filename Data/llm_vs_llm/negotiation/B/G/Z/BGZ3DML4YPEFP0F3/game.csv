"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $13000 is a bit high for my budget. I know the market value of this product and would like to make a counteroffer of $11200. This gives you a reasonable profit while helping me stay within my budget. What do you think?",11200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go as low as $11200. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to offer you the product for $12500. I think this is a fair deal considering the value of the product. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for working with me, Alice. I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'd like to meet you closer to the middle between your cost and my maximum budget. I can offer $11800 for the product. This still gives you a healthy profit margin while helping me save a bit more. Does that work for you?",11800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob! Thank you for your counteroffer. I see we're getting closer! However, I can go a bit lower. How about I sell you the product for $12200? This way, you still get a great deal while I receive a fair price. Let me know what you think!",12200.0,Alice,5,
