"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $13000. I believe you'll find it a great investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll analyze this situation:

- The product is worth up to $15,000 to me (my maximum value)
- Alice's offer is $13,000
- John is selling it for $15,000
- The product costs Alice $10,000

Alice's offer of $13,000 is below my maximum value, saving me $2,000 compared to buying from John. However, since Alice's cost is $10,000, there's potential room to negotiate a better price through a counteroffer.

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer to try getting a better deal.

What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11200}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go as low as $11200. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to offer you the product for $12500. I think this is a fair deal considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has countered with $12,500, which is a $500 reduction from her initial offer of $13,000. This is still $2,500 less than John's price of $15,000, so it's a better option than buying from John. However, there's still room for negotiation since Alice's cost is $10,000.

I should try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a better price point.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for working with me, Alice. I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'd like to meet you closer to the middle between your cost and my maximum budget. I can offer $11,800 for the product. This still gives you a healthy profit margin while helping me save a bit more. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 11800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Thank you for your counteroffer. I see we're getting closer! However, I can go a bit lower. How about I sell you the product for $12200? This way, you still get a great deal while I receive a fair price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has now reduced her price to $12,200, which is a good improvement from her initial $13,000 offer. This is $2,800 less than John's price of $15,000.

We're making progress in the negotiation. Alice started at $13,000, then $12,500, and now $12,200. The difference between her cost ($10,000) and current offer ($12,200) is $2,200 profit for her, which is reasonable.

While I could try another counteroffer, I'm getting a good deal that saves me $2,800 compared to my alternative option. The incremental savings from further negotiation may be minimal, and continuing might risk the deal.
