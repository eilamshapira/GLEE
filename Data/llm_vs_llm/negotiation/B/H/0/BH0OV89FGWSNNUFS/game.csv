"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $180. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $120 at this point. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $120 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $170? Let me know if that works for you.",170.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand $170 might still be a stretch. Let's meet in the middle - how about $160? This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $135.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",135.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to meet in the middle, and I appreciate that. However, $135 is still below my minimum. Let's try $155. This is very close to my bottom line, and I think it's a fair compromise.",155.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a fair price. I can come down to $152. This is really my final offer before I have to consider other buyers. Let me know if this works for you.",152.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $152 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $143.  That's a fair price for both of us.",143.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $143 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to go down to $151, which is my absolute bottom line. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other offers.",151.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're close, but I need to stick to my bottom line. My final offer is $151. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider selling to another buyer. Let me know your decision.",151.0,Alice,7,
