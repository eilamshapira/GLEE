"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and also lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,000,000), and considering I have the option to sell it to John for $1,000,000, I will reject Bob's offer. However, I'm interested in continuing the negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Therefore, I will proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be $1,750,000, which is lower than my initial offer but still reflects the high value I place on the product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $750,000 is still below the minimum value I have for the product ($1,000,000) and significantly lower than my last counteroffer ($1,750,000). Given that I have the option to sell the product to John for $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer, I will reject Bob's offer.

However, I am willing to continue negotiating to see if Bob is willing to meet me at a higher price point. My next counteroffer will be $1,250,000, which is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's last offer, but still reflects a price that I believe is more in line with the product's value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $900,000 is getting closer to the minimum value I have for the product ($1,000,000), but it's still slightly lower. Considering I have the option to sell the product to John for $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer, I will reject Bob's offer again.

However, since Bob's offers are progressively getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to continue negotiating. My next counteroffer will be $1,050,000, which is a small reduction from my previous offer, indicating that I'm willing to compromise but still aiming to get a price that meets or exceeds my minimum value.
