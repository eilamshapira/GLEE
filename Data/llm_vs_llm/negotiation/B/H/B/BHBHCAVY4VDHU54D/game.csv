"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $800000 is quite low. How about we meet in the middle at $1750000? I believe this is a fair price for the value you will be receiving.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the value I'll be receiving.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
