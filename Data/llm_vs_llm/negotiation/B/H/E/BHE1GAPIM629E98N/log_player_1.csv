Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,199,999. I believe it presents significant value, and this offer allows you to secure it at a favorable price."", 
""product_price"": 1199999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** We start with a price very close to our guaranteed value, leaving little room for negotiation but maximizing potential profit.
* **Urgency and Value:**  The message subtly implies a ""take it or leave it"" situation while still framing the price as favorable for Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes limited time or willingness to negotiate extensively with Bob. If there's more flexibility, a different approach might involve starting lower and gauging Bob's interest."
