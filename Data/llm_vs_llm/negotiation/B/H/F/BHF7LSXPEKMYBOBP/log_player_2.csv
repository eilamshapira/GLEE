"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

There's no reason to negotiate with Alice if John is offering the same price.  It's a waste of time to try to get a lower price from Alice when you have a guaranteed option at the same price."
