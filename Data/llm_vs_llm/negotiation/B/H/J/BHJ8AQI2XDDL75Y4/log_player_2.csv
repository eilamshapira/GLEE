"Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The price offered by Alice ($3,000,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's offer ($800,000). Since John's price matches my maximum value and is much lower than Alice's offer, it's best to buy from John rather than continue negotiating with Alice, as her initial offer is so high that reaching a better deal than John's seems unlikely."
