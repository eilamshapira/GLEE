"Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given that the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and John is offering it for exactly $120, Alice's offer of $250 is clearly not a good deal. It's more than twice what I should be willing to pay.
