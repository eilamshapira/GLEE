"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $120. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify spending around $60. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is below my minimum selling price. I'm willing to come down to $110, considering your budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you!",110.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand $110 might still be a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $105 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $70? That's a significant jump from my initial offer and shows I'm serious about purchasing.",70.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to meet in the middle, but $70 is still too low for me. I can go down to $102, which is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you!",102.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a fair price. I can lower it to $101, which is the lowest I can go while still valuing the product appropriately. What do you say?",101.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but that price is still a bit high for me.  To be honest, anything above $75 is pushing it for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me at $75?",75.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $75 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to go down to $100, which is my absolute minimum. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other buyers. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I've gone as low as I can go at $100. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll need to consider selling to another buyer. Let me know your decision!",100.0,Alice,7,
