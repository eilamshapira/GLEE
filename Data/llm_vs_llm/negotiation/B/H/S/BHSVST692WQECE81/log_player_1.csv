"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify spending around $60. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60.

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $105 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $70? That's a significant jump from my initial offer and shows I'm serious about purchasing.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but that price is still a bit high for me.  To be honest, anything above $75 is pushing it for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me at $75?
