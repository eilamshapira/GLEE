"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,499,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,499,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision that maximizes my financial outcome.

The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me.
- Alice is offering to sell it for $1,499,999
- John is offering to sell it for $1,000,000

Alice's offer exceeds both the value of the product to me and John's offer. It would not be rational for me to accept Alice's offer when I can get the same product from John at a significantly lower price that matches its value to me.
