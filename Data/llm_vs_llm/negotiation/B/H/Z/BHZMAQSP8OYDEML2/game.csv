,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I have another offer from John for $1500000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a reasonable middle ground. Would you consider $1200000 for the product?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand the constraints, and I'd love to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Given the product's market value and the benefits it offers, how about we settle at $1800000? I believe this reflects its true worth while coming down from my initial offer.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I have a firm maximum budget of $1500000, which is exactly what John is offering. To make it worth choosing you over John, I would need a better price. I can offer $1350000, which would be a fair deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
