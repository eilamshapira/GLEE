Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I have another offer from John for $1500000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a reasonable middle ground. Would you consider $1200000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I have a firm maximum budget of $1500000, which is exactly what John is offering. To make it worth choosing you over John, I would need a better price. I can offer $1350000, which would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.
