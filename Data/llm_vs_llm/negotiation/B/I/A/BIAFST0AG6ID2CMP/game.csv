"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you consider $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $9000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, my budget is still a bit tight. How about $9500? That's the highest I can realistically go.",9500.0,Bob,4,
