"Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand budget constraints, $9000 is quite a bit lower than what this product is worth. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $10500, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a very competitive offer considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10500 is still a bit high for me. I can go up to $9500. Let me know if this works for you.",9500.0,Bob,4,
