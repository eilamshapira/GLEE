Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $9,000 is relatively low compared to my initial asking price. While it's above my minimum threshold of $8,000, I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to find a middle ground between $12,000 and $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand budget constraints, $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what this product is worth. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $10,500, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a very competitive offer considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10500 is still a bit high for me. I can go up to $9500. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $9,500. While it's lower than my initial asking price, it's a reasonable compromise and represents a $1,500 premium over John's guaranteed offer of $8,000. Given that we've gone through multiple rounds of negotiation and Bob has shown willingness to increase his price, this seems like the best outcome we're likely to achieve without risking losing the sale altogether."
