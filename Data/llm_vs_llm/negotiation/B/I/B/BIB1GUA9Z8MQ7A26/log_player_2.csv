# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand budget constraints, $9000 is quite a bit lower than what this product is worth. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $10500, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a very competitive offer considering the product's value.
