"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $18,500 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $12,000, and it's also higher than John's alternative offer. It would be better to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations don't go well, I can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 10000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $10,000. This is below my maximum value of $12,000 and gives room for negotiation. If Alice rejects this offer, we can potentially meet somewhere in the middle, while still staying below both my maximum value and John's alternative offer of $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $16,000 is still above both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's alternative offer ($12,000). While Alice has reduced the price from her initial offer, it's still not acceptable. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. If Alice doesn't come down to a reasonable price, I can always take John's offer of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 11000}

I'll increase my previous offer to $11,000. This shows some flexibility and movement from my previous offer of $10,000, while still staying below both my maximum value and John's price of $12,000. This gives Alice room to continue negotiating while keeping the price in a range that would be acceptable to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $12,000. Here's why:

1. Alice's latest offer ($14,500) is still well above John's price ($12,000)
2. While Alice has been lowering her price, the decrements are getting smaller
3. We've already gone through half of our available rounds
4. Even if Alice continues to reduce her price at the current rate, it's unlikely she'll go below $12,000
5. There's no reason to pay more than $12,000 when that's my maximum value for the product

It's more rational to take John's guaranteed offer of $12,000 rather than continue negotiations that may not result in a better deal."
