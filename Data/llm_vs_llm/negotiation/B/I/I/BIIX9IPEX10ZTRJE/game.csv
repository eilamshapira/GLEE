"Alice, while I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, the initial offer is beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $800000 for it. Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your perspective on the price, the value of this product is significantly higher than your current offer reflects. I'm willing to come down to $1800000.  I'm confident that at this price point, you'll be getting an incredible deal.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $1800000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000. This is a significant step up from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget constraints. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I see you're serious about acquiring this product. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1500000.  This is a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach a mutually agreeable outcome.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $1500000 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950000. This is my final offer within my budget constraints. I hope we can close the deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe this product's value far exceeds your current offer. To be fair, I'm willing to make one final move. I can accept $1200000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it represents a very fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final move, but $1200000 is still beyond what I can justify spending. My offer of $950000 stands as my maximum. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",950000.0,Bob,8,
