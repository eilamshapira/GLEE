"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  I'm thinking a price of $1800000 feels right given its worth.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. While I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, since John is already offering the product at my maximum acceptable price of $1,200,000, the most rational decision would be to buy from John directly.
