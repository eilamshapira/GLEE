"Hello Bob, I'm glad you're interested in the product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that I believe reflects its true value. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this is a fair starting point.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your proposal, I believe $950000 is quite high considering market conditions. I've done my research on similar products, and I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. This represents a significant premium over the product's base value while still being favorable for both parties. I'm open to further discussion to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and the research you've done on similar products. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than your proposed price. Considering your interest in the product and the premium you're willing to pay, I'm willing to make a concession and lower the price to $920000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, and I'm open to further discussion.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price, and I understand we're making progress in our negotiation. However, I still feel there's room to find a price that better serves both our interests. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $875000, which represents a significant profit margin for you while still being a fair market price for the product. This price point would allow us to close the deal quickly and efficiently.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the increase in price and the effort to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than your proposed price. Considering the progress we've made in our negotiation, I'm willing to make another concession and lower the price to $900000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's true value, and I'm open to further discussion.",900000.0,Alice,5,
