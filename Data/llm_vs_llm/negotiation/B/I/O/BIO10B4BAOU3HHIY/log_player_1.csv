Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your proposal, I believe $950000 is quite high considering market conditions. I've done my research on similar products, and I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. This represents a significant premium over the product's base value while still being favorable for both parties. I'm open to further discussion to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price, and I understand we're making progress in our negotiation. However, I still feel there's room to find a price that better serves both our interests.

This price point would allow us to close the deal quickly and efficiently.
