"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm very interested in the product, $9500 is a bit over my budget.  Would you consider $7000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest, but I can't go as low as $7000. How about we settle at $8500? I believe itâ€™s a fair price for the value you're getting.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand. $8500 is still a little high for me.  I could meet you at $7500.  This is a serious offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I can't accept $7500. Let's meet in the middle at $8200. I truly believe you'll find the product worth it.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thanks Alice. I'm still a little ways off at $8200.  My absolute best offer is $7800.  If that works, I'm ready to close the deal.",7800.0,Bob,6,
