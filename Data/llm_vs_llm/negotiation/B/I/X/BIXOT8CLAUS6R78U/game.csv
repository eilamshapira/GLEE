"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the premium quality of your product, I find the asking price of $2200000 to be significantly above my budget. Based on my market research and needs, I would be willing to offer $1200000 for the product. This offer reflects a fair market value while considering my budget constraints. Would you be interested in considering this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but I cannot accept $1200000 as it is below my minimum acceptable price. Given the product's quality and market value, I can offer it to you for $1900000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. This represents a fair value for both parties. Would you consider this revised offer?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
