Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the premium quality of your product, I find the asking price of $2200000 to be significantly above my budget. Based on my market research and needs, I would be willing to offer $1200000 for the product. This offer reflects a fair market value while considering my budget constraints. Would you be interested in considering this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
