"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Based on its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it for $2200000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential value. Would you be interested in making this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,500,000, and also higher than John's price. While I'll reject this offer to negotiate, I'll keep John's option in mind as a backup. I can try to negotiate with Alice for a better price, but if we can't reach an agreement below $1,500,000, I can always buy from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the premium quality of your product, I find the asking price of $2,200,000 to be significantly above my budget.

Would you be interested in considering this price?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but I cannot accept $1200000 as it is below my minimum acceptable price. Given the product's quality and market value, I can offer it to you for $1900000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. This represents a fair value for both parties. Would you consider this revised offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's new offer of $1,900,000 is still significantly above John's price of $1,500,000 and above my maximum value, it makes more sense to buy from John. While Alice has reduced her price, she's still asking for $400,000 more than John's price. Given that John's price is at my maximum acceptable value and Alice seems unlikely to reduce her price below that point, the most rational decision is to end the negotiation and buy from John."
