Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, Bob, I'm excited to potentially offer you this unique product. I've put a lot of value into it, and I believe you'll see its potential.

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to offer you this exclusive product for $2,000,000. I believe it will be a great investment for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2000000 is beyond my budget for this product. I can offer $800000 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a tough spot. Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.

Considering my options:

*   **Accepting Bob's offer ($800,000):** This results in a loss, as it's below my minimum.
*   **Rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering:** This gives me another shot at getting a better price, but it's a gamble. Bob might lower his offer even further, or negotiations could fail, forcing me to sell to John for less.
*   **Selling to John ($1,200,000):** This guarantees I meet my minimum price and avoid further risk, but I could potentially earn more if I negotiate successfully with Bob.

I'm going to take a risk and see if I can get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, Bob, I understand that $2,000,000 was a bit high. However, I also need to consider the value of the product.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. Given the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll offer it to you for $1,600,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
