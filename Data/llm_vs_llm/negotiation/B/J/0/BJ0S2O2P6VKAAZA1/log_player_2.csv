"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to evaluate this offer from Alice. She's offering the product for $15,000, but I know the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me. Since John is willing to sell me the same product for $12,000, Alice's offer doesn't make economic sense for me.

While I could reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, there's no guarantee she'll accept a price below $12,000. Since I already have a guaranteed option to buy at $12,000 from John, and Alice's current offer exceeds that price, the rational choice is to buy from John.
