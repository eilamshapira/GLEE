Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this:

1. The product is worth $12,000 to Bob
2. My minimum acceptable price is $8,000
3. If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed $8,000 from John
4. Bob will likely reject if the price is too close to $12,000
5. I should offer a price that gives Bob some surplus but maximizes my profit

I'll offer $10,000, which:
- Gives Bob $2,000 in surplus ($12,000 - $10,000)
- Gives me $2,000 more than my fallback option
- Is a fair split of the additional value
