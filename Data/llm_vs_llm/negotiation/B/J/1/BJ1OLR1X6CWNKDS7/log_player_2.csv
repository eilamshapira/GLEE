"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $10,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John at $12,000

Since the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $10,000 is $2,000 less than John's price, it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer. This will save me $2,000 compared to buying from John.
