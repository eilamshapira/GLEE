"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. Alice's offer is $140
3. I know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's significant room for negotiation
4. I have 10 rounds to negotiate
5. John's price ($150) is my fallback option

Since Alice's initial offer of $140 is quite high compared to her cost ($80), and I have multiple rounds to negotiate, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. There's potential to get a better price, and I can always fall back to John's offer later if needed.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $80 to Alice and she started at $140, I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's significantly lower but not insultingly low. I want to leave room for negotiation while still showing I'm serious about making a deal.

{""product_price"": 95}

This offer gives Alice a reasonable profit margin ($15) above her cost while being much more favorable to me than her initial offer. It also leaves room for negotiation upward if needed, as I'm still willing to pay more than this, but I want to start low to have space for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice has moved down from $140 to $130, showing willingness to negotiate
2. However, $130 is still quite high considering her cost is $80
3. We've only used 3 of our 10 rounds
4. The gap between our positions ($95 vs $130) suggests there's still room for negotiation
5. John's price ($150) remains as a safe fallback

Since Alice has shown flexibility by reducing her price, and we still have plenty of rounds left, it makes sense to continue negotiating. $130 is still much closer to my maximum ($150) than to her cost ($80), so there should be room for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $10 from her initial offer (from $140 to $130), I'll also adjust my offer upward, but still maintain a strong negotiating position. I'll increase my previous offer of $95 by a proportional amount to show good faith in the negotiation while still aiming for a good deal.

{""product_price"": 110}

This counteroffer of $110:
1. Shows I'm willing to move up significantly from my initial $95
2. Still gives Alice a good profit ($30 above her cost)
3. Splits the difference between our last positions more evenly
4. Leaves room for further negotiation if needed
5. Is well below both her last offer ($130) and my maximum price ($150)"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let's analyze the current situation:

1. The negotiation pattern so far:
   - Alice: $140 → $130 → $125
   - Me: $95 → $110
2. Alice has shown consistent willingness to reduce price ($5-$10 per round)
3. The current gap between our positions ($125 vs $110) is getting smaller
4. We're halfway through our rounds (5 of 10)
5. The current offer ($125) represents a $25 savings compared to John's price

While Alice is moving in the right direction, $125 is still quite high considering her $80 cost. Given we still have 5 rounds left and the gap is narrowing, it's worth one more round of negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice has moved down to $125 and we're more than halfway through our rounds, I'll make a more substantial increase in my offer to show good faith and try to close the deal. The gap between our last positions ($125 vs $110) is $15, so I'll move up to meet her part way.

{""product_price"": 118}

This offer of $118:
1. Shows significant movement from my last offer ($110)
2. Still gives me a good deal compared to John's price ($150)
3. Provides Alice with a healthy profit margin ($38 above her cost)
4. Narrows the gap considerably (now only $7 from her last offer)
5. Signals that I'm serious about closing the deal while still maintaining some room for final negotiation if needed"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let's analyze the current situation:

1. The negotiation has progressed well:
   - Alice: $140 → $130 → $125 → $122
   - Me: $95 → $110 → $118
2. The current gap is only $4 ($122 vs $118)
3. Alice's offer of $122 represents a $28 savings compared to John's price
4. We're in round 7 of 10
5. Both parties have shown consistent willingness to compromise

Given that:
- The gap is now very small ($4)
- The price is reasonable (saves $28 compared to John)
- We've had a productive negotiation
- There's risk in pushing too hard when we've reached a fair price

I'll accept this offer. Further negotiation might risk the deal for minimal potential savings.
