"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While the product sounds interesting, $20000 is higher than I'm willing to pay. My budget is significantly lower. Would you consider $7000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand you have budget constraints, but $7000 is significantly below the product's value. While I can be flexible on the price, I cannot go below $16000 as this product offers premium quality and features that justify this price point. Would you consider this more reasonable offer?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $16000 is still beyond my budget. Given that I can purchase a similar product from another seller for $10000, my maximum offer for your product is $8500. Please let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you sharing that information about the similar product. However, I can assure you that our product offers superior quality and features compared to the $10000 alternative you mentioned. Given this, I'm willing to come down to $14000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer while reflecting the premium value you'll receive. Would you consider meeting me at this price?",14000.0,Alice,5,
