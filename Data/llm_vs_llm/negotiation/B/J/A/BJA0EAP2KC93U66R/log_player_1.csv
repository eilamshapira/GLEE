"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a wonderful product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it for $20,000. This is a premium product with excellent features and quality. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While the product sounds interesting, $20000 is higher than I'm willing to pay. My budget is significantly lower. Would you consider $7000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer since $7,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 (what John is offering). I'd rather continue negotiating with Bob to try to reach a better price, as there's still plenty of rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand you have budget constraints, but $7,000 is significantly below the product's value. While I can be flexible on the price, I cannot go below $16,000 as this product offers premium quality and features that justify this price point. Would you consider this more reasonable offer?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $16000 is still beyond my budget. Given that I can purchase a similar product from another seller for $10000, my maximum offer for your product is $8500. Please let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob mentioned he can get a similar product for $10,000, but is only offering $8,500, I'll continue negotiating. His reference price of $10,000 suggests there might be room to negotiate upward. However, if we can't reach a price above $12,000 in the next few rounds, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you sharing that information about the similar product. However, I can assure you that our product offers superior quality and features compared to the $10,000 alternative you mentioned. Given this, I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer while reflecting the premium value you'll receive. Would you consider meeting me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
