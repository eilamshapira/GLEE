"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand you have budget constraints, but I cannot go below $16000 as this product has significant value in the market. I've already reduced it from my initial offer to show good faith in our negotiation.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $16000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $9000. I hope we can find a middle ground. What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,4,
