"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $8,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even below Bob's own valuation of $10,000. There's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand you have budget constraints, but I cannot go below $16,000 as this product has significant value in the market. I've already reduced it from my initial offer to show good faith in our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $16000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $9000. I hope we can find a middle ground. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $15,000. It's clear that Bob's maximum budget ($10,000 valuation) is well below my minimum acceptable price ($15,000), and after multiple rounds of negotiation, we're still far apart. Bob's offers are actually moving up very slowly ($8,000 to $9,000), and it's unlikely we'll reach an acceptable price within the remaining rounds. The guaranteed $15,000 from John is the best option."
