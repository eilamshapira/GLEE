"Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. I'm interested in the product, but the price of $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to lower my price to $1100000. Let me know if this works for you!",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price to $1100000, but it's still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can go down to $1050000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you can work with!",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, the price of $1050000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need you to consider a lower price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. If we can't agree on a price, I may need to explore other options, such as purchasing from John for $800000.",950000.0,Bob,6,
