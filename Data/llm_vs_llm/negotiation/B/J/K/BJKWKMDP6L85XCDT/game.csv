"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I am offering it at $2300000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential value. Would you be interested in making this purchase?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling me this product, but I must say that $2300000 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm prepared to offer $1200000 for the product, which I believe is a reasonable price given the current market conditions. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must point out that you seem to have your information mixed up. John is actually willing to buy from me, not sell to you, at $1500000. Therefore, I cannot accept any offer below that amount as it would not make business sense. However, I'm willing to reduce my initial price significantly. I can offer you the product for $1900000, which is a $400000 reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects both the true value of the product and my desire to do business with you rather than John. Would you consider this more reasonable offer?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for reducing your price, but there seems to be some confusion. According to the information I have, John is indeed willing to sell me this product for $1500000, not buy from you. That's my alternative option if we can't reach an agreement. Your current offer of $1900000 is still significantly above what I'm willing to pay, especially considering I can get the same product elsewhere for $1500000. To continue our negotiation, I'm prepared to offer $1350000, which is a fair price that works within my budget constraints while still being competitive. This offer gives you a chance to close the deal quickly rather than potentially losing the sale altogether.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
