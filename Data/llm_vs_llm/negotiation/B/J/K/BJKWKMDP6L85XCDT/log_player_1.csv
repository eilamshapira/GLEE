Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling me this product, but I must say that $2300000 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm prepared to offer $1200000 for the product, which I believe is a reasonable price given the current market conditions. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,200,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, which is what John is willing to pay. Bob is trying to use John as leverage, but ironically, John is actually my alternative buyer at a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, slightly reducing my initial price but staying well above my reservation price of $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must point out that you seem to have your information mixed up. John is actually willing to buy from me, not sell to you, at $1,500,000. Therefore, I cannot accept any offer below that amount as it would not make business sense. However, I'm willing to reduce my initial price significantly. I can offer you the product for $1,900,000, which is a $400,000 reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects both the true value of the product and my desire to do business with you rather than John. Would you consider this more reasonable offer?"", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for reducing your price, but there seems to be some confusion. According to the information I have, John is indeed willing to sell me this product for $1500000, not buy from you. That's my alternative option if we can't reach an agreement. Your current offer of $1900000 is still significantly above what I'm willing to pay, especially considering I can get the same product elsewhere for $1500000. To continue our negotiation, I'm prepared to offer $1350000, which is a fair price that works within my budget constraints while still being competitive. This offer gives you a chance to close the deal quickly rather than potentially losing the sale altogether. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I choose to sell to John for $1,500,000. Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is still below what John is willing to pay, and Bob seems to be confused or mistaken about John's role (claiming John is a seller when I know John is actually a buyer willing to pay $1,500,000). Since we're already in round 4 and Bob's offers are still below my guaranteed price from John, it's best to take the sure deal with John rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might not reach a better outcome."
