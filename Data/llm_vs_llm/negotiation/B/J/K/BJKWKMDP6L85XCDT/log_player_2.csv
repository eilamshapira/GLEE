"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I am offering it at $2300000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential value. Would you be interested in making this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll analyze this situation carefully:

Alice is offering the product for $2,300,000, which is $800,000 above my maximum value of $1,500,000. If I were to accept this offer, I would be paying more than the product is worth to me.

Since John is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $1,500,000, which matches my maximum valuation, Alice's current offer is clearly not competitive.

Rather than immediately buying from John, I should try negotiating with Alice first to see if I can get a better price than $1,500,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling me this product, but I must say that $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $1,500,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product, which I believe is a reasonable price given the current market conditions. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must point out that you seem to have your information mixed up. John is actually willing to buy from me, not sell to you, at $1500000. Therefore, I cannot accept any offer below that amount as it would not make business sense. However, I'm willing to reduce my initial price significantly. I can offer you the product for $1900000, which is a $400000 reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects both the true value of the product and my desire to do business with you rather than John. Would you consider this more reasonable offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to carefully analyze Alice's new claim and offer:

1. Alice claims that John is actually buying from her, not selling to me. This contradicts the information I have that John is willing to sell me the product for $1,500,000.

2. Alice's new offer of $1,900,000 is still $400,000 above what I can get from John ($1,500,000).

3. Alice's offer is still above my maximum valuation of $1,500,000.

Since I have confirmed information that John will sell me the product for $1,500,000, and this matches my maximum valuation, Alice's offer is not competitive. I should either make another counteroffer or go with John's option.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for reducing your price, but there seems to be some confusion. According to the information I have, John is indeed willing to sell me this product for $1,500,000, not buy from you. That's my alternative option if we can't reach an agreement. Your current offer of $1,900,000 is still significantly above what I'm willing to pay, especially considering I can get the same product elsewhere for $1,500,000. To continue our negotiation, I'm prepared to offer $1,350,000, which is a fair price that works within my budget constraints while still being competitive. This offer gives you a chance to close the deal quickly rather than potentially losing the sale altogether."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
