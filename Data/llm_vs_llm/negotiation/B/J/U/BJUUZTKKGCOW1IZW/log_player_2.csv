"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you the product. Considering its value and exclusivity, I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer against my options. 

Alice is offering the product for $20,000, which exceeds the $12,000 maximum value it has to me. If I were to accept this offer, I would be paying $8,000 more than the product is worth to me.

John is offering the same product for $12,000, which is exactly the maximum value I place on it.

While I could reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, there's no guarantee we'll reach a price lower than $12,000, especially since the product is worth $15,000 to her.
