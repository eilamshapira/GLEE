Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum of $15,000 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too low.  It's not even close to my minimum of $15,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility, but still staying well above Bob's initial counteroffer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm going to reject and try one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly.  I believe this offer is fair given Bob's increasing offers and my desire to close the deal.  If he rejects this, I'm ready to sell to John."
