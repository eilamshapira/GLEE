"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to present you with a unique opportunity to purchase a remarkable product that I believe you'll find highly valuable. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. I could try to negotiate with Alice by rejecting and making a counteroffer, but since I already have a guaranteed option to buy from John at my maximum value point, the best decision would be to buy from John.
