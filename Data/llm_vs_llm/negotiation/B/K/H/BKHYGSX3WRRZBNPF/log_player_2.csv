"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $12,000
2. My maximum value for the product is $15,000
3. John's fixed price is $15,000
4. If I reject, I can make a counteroffer

Alice's offer of $12,000 is already $3,000 less than my maximum value and John's price. While I could try to negotiate for an even lower price by making a counteroffer, this is already a good deal that saves me $3,000 compared to buying from John.

Since $12,000 is a reasonable price that's well below my maximum value, I'll accept this offer.
