Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider the best strategy here. I'm selling a product that's worth at least $100 to me, and Bob values it at $80. If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell it to John for $100.

Since Bob values the product at $80, he won't accept any offer above $80. And since I have a guaranteed sale to John for $100, it doesn't make sense for me to sell to Bob for less than $100.

Therefore, I should offer Bob a price of exactly $100. If he accepts (though unlikely based on his valuation), I get $100. If he rejects, I still get $100 from John.
