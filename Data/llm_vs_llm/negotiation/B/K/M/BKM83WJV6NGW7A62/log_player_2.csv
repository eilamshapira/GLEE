"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer is $12,000, which is the same price as John's offer, there's no advantage in accepting Alice's offer right now. It's better to reject and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price from Alice. If negotiations don't work out, I can always buy from John later at the same price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a significantly lower offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low that it would be considered unreasonable.

{""product_price"": 8000}

This offer is about 33% lower than Alice's initial price. It's a reasonable starting point that gives room for negotiation while still being a serious offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price by $500 from her initial offer, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, there might still be room for a better deal. Since I can always buy from John at $12,000, and I still have several rounds of negotiation left, I'll reject this offer and try for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice came down $500 from her initial offer, showing some flexibility. I'll increase my previous offer significantly to show good faith in negotiating, but still try to get a better deal than her current offer.

{""product_price"": 9500}

This offer splits the difference between my previous offer ($8,000) and her current offer ($11,500), showing I'm willing to move substantially while still seeking a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has now reduced her price to $11,000, which is $1,000 less than John's price. She's showing consistent willingness to negotiate by reducing her price by $500 in each round. While this is a good offer, since I still have several rounds left and she's shown a pattern of making concessions, I'll try one more time to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has been decreasing her price by $500 each time, and I want to show I'm also willing to move significantly to meet in the middle. I'll raise my previous offer of $9,500 by a similar increment.

{""product_price"": 10,250}

This offer splits the remaining gap between my last offer ($9,500) and her current offer ($11,000), showing I'm willing to make substantial movement while still trying to secure a good deal. If she doesn't accept this, I might need to accept her next offer as the rounds are running out and her offers have been consistently getting better."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has now offered $10,750, which is $1,250 less than John's price and shows continued willingness to negotiate. Given that:
1. We're in round 7 of 10, so rounds are running out
2. The gap between our last positions has narrowed significantly ($10,250 vs $10,750)
3. This is a good price that saves me $1,250 compared to John's offer
4. There's a risk Alice might increase her price if we continue too long

I'll accept this offer as it represents a good deal and further negotiation might risk losing the progress we've made.
