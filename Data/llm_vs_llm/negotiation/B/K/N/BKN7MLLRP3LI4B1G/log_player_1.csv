"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $1,200,000, which represents excellent value given its quality and potential. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous message. I understand that we are in a negotiation process. I would like to propose a new offer of $900000. How does that sound to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. While $900,000 is above my minimum threshold, I believe there's still room for negotiation as my initial offer indicates the product's true value is significantly higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, I believe the product's value is substantially higher. I can come down from my initial price, but $1,050,000 would be a more reasonable price point, considering the product's quality and market value. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I believe there is still room for negotiation. I am now offering $975000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $975,000. This is a reasonable price that represents a good profit margin above my minimum threshold of $800,000, and Bob has shown willingness to negotiate upward substantially from his first offer. While we might be able to negotiate further, there's also a risk of losing the deal, and this price represents a good outcome for both parties."
