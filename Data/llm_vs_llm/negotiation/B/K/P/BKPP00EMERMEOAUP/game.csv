"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but $1200000 is beyond my budget. Considering my constraints and from my perspective, a fair price would be closer to $600000. Would you consider that?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1200000 might be beyond your budget, but I'm afraid $600000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $1050000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for reconsidering, Alice. While I understand your position, $1050000 is still beyond what I can reasonably invest. Given my budget constraints, I am able to go up to $700000. Would this be acceptable for you?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $700000. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. Considering the product's value and the fact that you've already shown flexibility, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current one. I can offer the product to you for $900000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,5,
