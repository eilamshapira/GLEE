"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth and I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but $1200000 is beyond my budget. Considering my constraints and from my perspective, a fair price would be closer to $600000. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me ($1,000,000) and even lower than its worth to Bob ($800,000), I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate and try to reach a better price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is an option, but I want to explore the possibility of getting a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 might be beyond your budget, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for reconsidering, Alice. While I understand your position, $1050000 is still beyond what I can reasonably invest. Given my budget constraints, I am able to go up to $700000. Would this be acceptable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Although Bob has increased his offer to $700,000, it's still lower than the product's worth to him ($800,000) and significantly lower than its worth to me ($1,000,000). I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer. I have 6 rounds left to negotiate, and I'm willing to try to reach a better price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is still an option, but I want to continue exploring the possibility of getting a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $700,000. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. Considering the product's value and the fact that you've already shown flexibility, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current one. I can offer the product to you for $900,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
