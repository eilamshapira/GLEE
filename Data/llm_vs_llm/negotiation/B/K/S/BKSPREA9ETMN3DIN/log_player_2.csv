"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. Considering its unique features and value, I'm prepared to let it go for $25000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I should definitely not accept Alice's offer of $25,000 since it's significantly higher than both my maximum value ($15,000) and John's price ($15,000). Since Alice's initial offer is much higher than the product's worth to me, it's best to avoid lengthy negotiations and simply go with John's guaranteed offer.
