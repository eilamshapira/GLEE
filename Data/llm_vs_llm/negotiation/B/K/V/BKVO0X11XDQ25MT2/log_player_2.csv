"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll analyze this situation:

Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000, which is exactly the maximum amount I value the product at. This is also identical to John's price of $1,500,000.

Since Alice's initial offer shows no discount compared to my alternative option (John), I should try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice that's significantly lower than her initial price, giving room for negotiation while trying to get the best deal possible.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll analyze this new situation:

Alice has reduced her offer to $1,350,000, which is $150,000 less than both her initial offer and John's price. This is a good improvement, but I should try to negotiate further since we still have plenty of rounds left and Alice has shown willingness to reduce the price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by dropping her price to $1,350,000 from $1,500,000. I'll continue negotiating by increasing my previous offer, but still aiming for a good deal.

{""product_price"": $1,100,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll analyze this new situation:

Alice has further reduced her offer to $1,250,000, which is now $250,000 less than John's price. She's continuing to make meaningful concessions ($100,000 reduction from her previous offer), showing room for further negotiation.

Since we still have several rounds left and Alice has demonstrated willingness to lower the price, I should continue negotiating to try to get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has continued to show flexibility by lowering her price to $1,250,000. I'll increase my previous offer to continue moving toward a middle ground, while still trying to secure a good deal.

{""product_price"": $1,175,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll analyze this new situation:

Alice has reduced her offer again to $1,225,000, which is now $275,000 less than John's price. However, her concession is getting smaller ($25,000 reduction from her previous offer), which suggests we may be approaching her limit.

This is a very good offer already - we've negotiated a substantial discount from the original $1,500,000. While I could try to push for an even lower price, the risk of losing the deal increases with each round, and the potential additional savings are getting smaller.

With this substantial discount already secured and only a few rounds remaining, I'll accept this offer.
