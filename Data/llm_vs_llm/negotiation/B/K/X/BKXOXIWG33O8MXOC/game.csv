"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I can only afford to pay $4000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price?",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for getting back to me. I understand that $20000 might be a bit high for your budget. However, I'm unable to accept your offer of $4000 as it's significantly lower than the product's value. I'm willing to lower my price to $18000 to meet you halfway. What do you think about this new offer?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $18000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $6000, which is a significant stretch for me. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I've reconsidered my previous offer and I'm willing to accept a lower price to reach an agreement. I won't sell the product for less then $15000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price so we can close the deal?",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to lower the price. However, $15000 is still significantly above my budget. Considering my previous offers and your last price, I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my last offer and make a one-time final offer of $7000. If this is not acceptable, I will need to explore other options. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",7000.0,Bob,6,
