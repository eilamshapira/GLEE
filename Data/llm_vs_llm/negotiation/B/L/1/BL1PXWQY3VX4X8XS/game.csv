"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product from you. While I am definitely interested, I believe your asking price of $950000 is quite high considering market conditions. The product is valuable to me, but I need to be prudent with my investment. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000, which I believe is fair and would allow us both to benefit from this transaction. I'm looking forward to your response.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $850000. I understand your concerns about the market conditions, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than your offer. I'm willing to make a concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $925000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm open to further discussions and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. That shows we're both committed to making this deal work. However, $925000 is still quite high for what I'm seeing in the market. The product is valuable, but I need to be conscious of my budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $875000, which represents a significant increase from my initial offer and would allow both of us to walk away satisfied with the transaction. I hope we can finalize this deal and move forward.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $875000. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make another concession. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $900000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. At this price, I believe we're getting close to a fair deal that reflects the product's value. I'm hopeful that we can finalize the transaction at this price, and I'm looking forward to your response.",900000.0,Alice,5,
