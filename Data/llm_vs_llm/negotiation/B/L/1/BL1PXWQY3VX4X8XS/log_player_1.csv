Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product from you. While I am definitely interested, I believe your asking price of $950000 is quite high considering market conditions. The product is valuable to me, but I need to be prudent with my investment. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000, which I believe is fair and would allow us both to benefit from this transaction. I'm looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $850,000 because it's lower than my initial offer, and I believe the product is worth more. Since it's also close to the minimum amount I'm willing to accept ($800,000), I'd like to try to negotiate a better price with Bob before considering selling to John. I'll proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round."

I understand your concerns about the market conditions, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than your offer.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. That shows we're both committed to making this deal work. However, $925000 is still quite high for what I'm seeing in the market. The product is valuable, but I need to be conscious of my budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $875000, which represents a significant increase from my initial offer and would allow both of us to walk away satisfied with the transaction. I hope we can finalize this deal and move forward.

I reject Bob's offer of $875,000. Although it's getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, I still believe I can get a better deal. Bob has shown willingness to increase his offer, and I'm hoping to negotiate a price that's even higher. Since $875,000 is still below my desired price, I'll make another counteroffer to try to meet my target. Selling to John for $800,000 is still an option, but I'd like to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob first."
