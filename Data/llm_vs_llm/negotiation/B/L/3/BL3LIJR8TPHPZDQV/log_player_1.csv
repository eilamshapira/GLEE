"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, I need to make a decision. My options are:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer:** Sell for $75 (Profit: $75 - $80 = -$5 - I lose money)
*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer and counter:** I'm hoping for a higher price.
*   **(3) Sell to John:** Sell for $80 (Profit: $80 - $80 = $0 - break even)

Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, I cannot accept Bob's offer of $75, as I would lose money. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counter_offer"": 140}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest Bob. I understand your initial offer, but I can't go that low. How about $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, let's analyze my options:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer:** Sell for $90 (Profit: $90 - $80 = $10 - I make a profit)
*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer and counter:** Risk further negotiation, potentially getting a better price, but also risk losing the sale entirely.
*   **(3) Sell to John:** Sell for $80 (Profit: $80 - $80 = $0 - break even)

This is a decent offer. It's higher than my minimum price and will give me a profit. I still have several rounds to go and can still make a higher offer to Bob. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counter offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counter_offer"": 120}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks again Bob. While $90 is tempting, I still think the product is worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I see we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to go up a bit, but $120 is still a bit steep for me. How about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, let's re-evaluate:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer:** Sell for $105 (Profit: $105 - $80 = $25 - Good profit)
*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer and counter:** Risk further negotiation, potentially getting a better price, but also risk losing the sale entirely. I have 4 more rounds to go.
*   **(3) Sell to John:** Sell for $80 (Profit: $80 - $80 = $0 - break even)

I'm getting good offers, I still have 4 more rounds and can negotiate higher, but Bob's offer is already good. I'll reject his offer and try for a slightly higher price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counter_offer"": 115}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""I'm glad we're close! Let's try $115. I'm sure you'll be happy with the product at that price."", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think we're really close now. I'm willing to meet you almost halfway between my last offer and yours. How about $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Let's evaluate:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer:** Sell for $110 (Profit: $110 - $80 = $30 - Excellent profit!)
*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer and counter:** Risk further negotiation, potentially getting a better price, but also risk losing the sale entirely. I have 2 rounds to go.
*   **(3) Sell to John:** Sell for $80 (Profit: $80 - $80 = $0 - break even)

The offer is already very good. I only have two rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing a good deal.
