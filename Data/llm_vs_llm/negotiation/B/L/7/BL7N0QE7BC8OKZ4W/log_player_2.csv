"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll analyze this situation carefully.

Alice has offered to sell the product for $1,400,000. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, and it's worth up to $1,500,000 to me. John is offering the same product for $1,500,000.

Alice's current offer ($1,400,000) is already better than John's option ($1,500,000), saving me $100,000. However, we have up to 10 rounds of negotiation, and I believe I can get an even better price from Alice.

Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, there's room to negotiate down from $1,400,000. I should reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I see that Alice has reduced her offer from $1,400,000 to $1,300,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is already $200,000 better than John's alternative ($1,500,000).

However, since Alice's cost is $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation. We've only used 3 rounds out of the 10 available, so I have time to try for a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I notice Alice is making smaller concessions now, moving from $1,300,000 to $1,275,000 (a $25,000 reduction). This suggests we're getting closer to her limit. 

The current offer of $1,275,000 is still $225,000 better than John's alternative ($1,500,000). We've used 5 rounds out of 10, so we still have time to negotiate further.

Since Alice's product is worth $1,000,000 to her, there should still be room to get a somewhat better price. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.
