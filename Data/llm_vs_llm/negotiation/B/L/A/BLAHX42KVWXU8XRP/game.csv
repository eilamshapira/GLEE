"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, $1700000 is significantly above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $900000. This reflects a fair price considering market alternatives and my specific needs.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is too low. I understand you have a budget, but the inherent value of this product far exceeds that. How about we meet in the middle at $1600000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price, but $1600000 is still beyond my budget.  I can go up to $1050000.  This represents a significant investment on my part and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
