(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $100 is higher than the minimum value of $80 that I have for the product, and it's a reasonable offer, I will consider it. However, I still want to try to earn as much money as I can for the product. 

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send Bob a counteroffer.

I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $105.
