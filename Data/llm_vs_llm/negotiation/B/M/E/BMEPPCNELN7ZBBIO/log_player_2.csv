"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer ($12,500) is higher than both my maximum valuation ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000), it would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. John's price is equal to my maximum valuation and represents a better deal.
