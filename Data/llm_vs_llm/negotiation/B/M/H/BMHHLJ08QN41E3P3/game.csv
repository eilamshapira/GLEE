"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice. How about we settle for $10000? This seems like a fair middle ground to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $12500? It's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,
