"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if Alice can lower her price. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, so I'll make a counteroffer based on that.

Counteroffer: $9,000"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit higher than I was expecting. I can offer $9,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is coming down in price, so there might still be room to negotiate. I'll make another counteroffer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $12500? It's a fair price for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
