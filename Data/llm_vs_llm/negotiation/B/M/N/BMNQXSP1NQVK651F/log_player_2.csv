Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm setting the initial price at $20000. I'm confident you'll recognize its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since the offer of $20,000 is above my budget of $15,000, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still shows that I'm interested in the product. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a relatively low offer.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10000 is a tempting offer, this product truly offers significant value beyond that price point. I'm willing to come down to $17000.  This offer reflects the product's inherent worth and potential return on investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $17,000 is still above my target budget of $15,000, but it's getting closer. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $15,000, I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous offer, but still lower than Alice's current offer. I'll try to meet Alice halfway between my previous offer and her current offer.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $17,000. However, I'm still a bit constrained by my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'll offer $13,500, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $15000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it's a very fair price for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $15,000 is exactly at my budget limit, and it's the same price that John is offering. Since I can get the same product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in continuing to negotiate with Alice. I might as well just buy it from John, as it would save me the hassle of further negotiation.
