"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Looking at the options:

1. Alice's offer: $2,000,000
2. John's price: $1,200,000
3. My maximum value for the product: $1,200,000

Alice's offer ($2,000,000) is significantly higher than the product's worth to me ($1,200,000) and higher than John's price. Buying from Alice would mean I'm overpaying by $800,000.

John's price ($1,200,000) exactly matches the maximum I value the product at. While I'm not saving money compared to my valuation, I'm not losing money either.
