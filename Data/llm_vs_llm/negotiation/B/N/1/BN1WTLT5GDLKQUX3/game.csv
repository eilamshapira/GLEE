"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be beneficial for you. I'm offering it at $20000. This product has excellent features and is in high demand. Let me know if you're interested.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $20000 is much higher than I can afford to pay. The product is only worth $10000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a fair price. Given that I can get this elsewhere for $10000, would you consider selling it for $8500? This would save me some money while still giving you a sale.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you have other options, I need to clarify that the product's value to me is no less than $15000. This reflects its quality and market value. John is actually willing to buy it from me at $15000, not sell it as you mentioned. I'd be happy to work with you, but I can't go below my minimum threshold. Could you consider a price of $16000? This is significantly lower than my initial offer while still providing you with the quality product you're looking for.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for lowering your offer to $16000. However, there seems to be some confusion. I have confirmed that John is willing to sell me this product for $10000, not buy it from you for $15000. Since the product is only worth $10000 to me, I cannot pay more than that amount - otherwise, I would be taking a loss. My best offer is $9500, which is slightly less than what I would pay John, but would allow us to close this deal now. If we can't agree on a price near this range, I'll need to go with John's offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
