Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be beneficial for you. I'm offering it at $20,000. This product has excellent features and is in high demand. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 20000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $20000 is much higher than I can afford to pay. The product is only worth $10000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a fair price. Given that I can get this elsewhere for $10000, would you consider selling it for $8500? This would save me some money while still giving you a sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you have other options, I need to clarify that the product's value to me is no less than $15,000. This reflects its quality and market value. John is actually willing to buy it from me at $15,000, not sell it as you mentioned. I'd be happy to work with you, but I can't go below my minimum threshold. Could you consider a price of $16,000? This is significantly lower than my initial offer while still providing you with the quality product you're looking for."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for lowering your offer to $16000. However, there seems to be some confusion. I have confirmed that John is willing to sell me this product for $10000, not buy it from you for $15000. Since the product is only worth $10000 to me, I cannot pay more than that amount - otherwise, I would be taking a loss. My best offer is $9500, which is slightly less than what I would pay John, but would allow us to close this deal now. If we can't agree on a price near this range, I'll need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
