"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be beneficial for you. I'm offering it at $20000. This product has excellent features and is in high demand. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's alternative price ($10,000). It makes no sense for me to accept this offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $20,000 is much higher than I can afford to pay. The product is only worth $10,000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $10,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a fair price. Given that I can get this elsewhere for $10,000, would you consider selling it for $8,500? This would save me some money while still giving you a sale."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you have other options, I need to clarify that the product's value to me is no less than $15000. This reflects its quality and market value. John is actually willing to buy it from me at $15000, not sell it as you mentioned. I'd be happy to work with you, but I can't go below my minimum threshold. Could you consider a price of $16000? This is significantly lower than my initial offer while still providing you with the quality product you're looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has dropped her price to $16,000, but this is still significantly higher than my maximum value ($10,000) and John's alternative price ($10,000). There seems to be some confusion - Alice claims John would buy it from her for $15,000, but I was told John would sell it to me for $10,000. Regardless, Alice's current offer exceeds what I'm willing to pay.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for lowering your offer to $16,000. However, there seems to be some confusion. I have confirmed that John is willing to sell me this product for $10,000, not buy it from you for $15,000. Since the product is only worth $10,000 to me, I cannot pay more than that amount - otherwise, I would be taking a loss. My best offer is $9,500, which is slightly less than what I would pay John, but would allow us to close this deal now. If we can't agree on a price near this range, I'll need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
