Hi Bob! I have a great product I think you'd be really interested in. I'm offering it to you for $300. What do you think?,300.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer but $300 is way too high for me. Given that I can get this product elsewhere for $120, I'd be willing to offer you $80 for it. This gives you a quick sale and saves me the trouble of going elsewhere. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. However, I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 is just too far off. How about $280?",280.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $80, but $280 is still much higher than what I can get elsewhere. To be completely transparent, I can buy this product from another seller for $120. I'm willing to offer you $100 - this way you make a quick sale and I save a bit of money. Would that work for you?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have other options, but I'm confident this product is worth more than $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $200?",200.0,Alice,5,
