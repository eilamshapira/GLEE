Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I have a great product I think you'd be really interested in. I'm offering it to you for $300. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 300}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer but $300 is way too high for me. Given that I can get this product elsewhere for $120, I'd be willing to offer you $80 for it. This gives you a quick sale and saves me the trouble of going elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, I'm not willing to sell for $80. That's far below my minimum. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. However, I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 is just too far off. How about $280?"", ""product_price"": 280}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $80, but $280 is still much higher than what I can get elsewhere. To be completely transparent, I can buy this product from another seller for $120. I'm willing to offer you $100 - this way you make a quick sale and I save a bit of money. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Hmm, $100 is still below my minimum. I'm starting to think Bob might be lowballing me. I could try one more counteroffer, but I'm also getting close to the point where I should just sell to John. I'll try one more counter offer, but if he doesn't budge much, I'll go with John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have other options, but I'm confident this product is worth more than $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $200?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
