"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer of $18,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($15,000) and John's price ($15,000), I'll reject this offer. It would be unwise to accept a price that's $3,000 higher than my maximum value. If Alice doesn't accept my upcoming counteroffer, I can always buy from John at $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm offering $13,000, which is below John's price of $15,000. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to buying from John. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Alice, there's a chance she might accept this offer or at least continue negotiating, as she could still make a profit. If she rejects this, we can continue negotiating, or I always have the option to go to John as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John for $15,000. Alice's new offer of $16,500 is still above John's price ($15,000) and my maximum value ($15,000). Since John's price is at my maximum acceptable price and is $1,500 less than Alice's current offer, it makes the most economic sense to buy from John rather than continue negotiating with Alice or accept her above-market price."
