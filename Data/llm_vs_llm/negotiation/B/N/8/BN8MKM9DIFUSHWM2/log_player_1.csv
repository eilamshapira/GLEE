Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $5,000 since it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 (and even below John's guaranteed offer). However, I'll continue negotiating with Bob since there's still potential to get a better price than John's $8,000.

Since we're now in round 4 and Bob's increments are relatively small (only increased by $1,000), I'll reject this offer but will consider selling to John if Bob doesn't make substantial improvements in his next offer.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Given that we're now in round 6 out of 10, and Bob's offer is still below John's guaranteed $8,000, and Bob's increments are still relatively small ($1,000 increase), I think it's best to secure the guaranteed sale to John rather than risk further negotiations that might not reach $8,000.
