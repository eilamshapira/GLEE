Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. Given its high quality and value, I'm pricing it at $95. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll agree."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $95 feels a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $70 is lower than what I can get from John ($80), and also lower than the product's worth to me, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $70 is a bit too low for me.

Since Bob's offer of $80 is equal to what I can get from John, and considering that further negotiations may not lead to a better outcome, I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $80."
