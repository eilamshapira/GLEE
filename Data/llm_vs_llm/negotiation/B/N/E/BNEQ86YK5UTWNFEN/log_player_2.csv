"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. Given its high quality and value, I'm pricing it at $95. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll agree. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is quite close to John's price. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better deal from Alice before resorting to paying John's full price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $95 feels a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer leaves room for negotiation. It also tests Alice's willingness to move from her initial price.  Aiming for $70 is a good starting point as it provides a significant saving while still being a potentially acceptable profit for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $70 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $90. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice came down a bit, it's still too close to John's price.  There's room for further negotiation. I'll try to nudge the price down a bit more before accepting or resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $80? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:** Offering $80 splits the difference between her current offer ($90) and my previous offer ($70). This shows a willingness to negotiate while still striving for a good deal. It also happens to be the price Alice values the product at, meaning she'll likely accept."
