"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","$140 is significantly higher than the product's worth to me ($100), and it's also higher than the offer from John ($100). It makes more sense to either negotiate with Alice or buy from John directly.

Given that John is offering the product at exactly my maximum valuation of $100, and Alice's initial offer is quite high, I'll reject this offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round.

Since John's offer is still better than Alice's current offer, and we still have several rounds for negotiation, I'll reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating.
