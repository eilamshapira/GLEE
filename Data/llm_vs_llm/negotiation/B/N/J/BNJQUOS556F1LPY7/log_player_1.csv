Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,300,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $2300000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. The offered price of $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and I know I can get that amount from John. However, I'll try one more negotiation round with Bob to see if we can reach a more reasonable price.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $800,000 is far below the product's value. Given the product's quality and market position, I can offer it to you for $1,900,000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"

Bob's offer:

I'll sell to John for $1,500,000. Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below what I can get from John, and given that Bob has stated this is his maximum budget, continuing negotiations would likely not lead to a better outcome. It's best to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John rather than risk further negotiations or accept a lower price."
