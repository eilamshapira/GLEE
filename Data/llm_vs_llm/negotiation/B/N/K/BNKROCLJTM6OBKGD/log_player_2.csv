"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and exclusivity, I'm valuing it at $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering the product for $120, but the product is only worth up to $80 to me according to my instructions.

John (spelled ""Jhon"" in the options) is willing to sell me the same product for $80, which matches the maximum value I place on it.

Since Alice's price ($120) exceeds both my maximum value and John's alternative price, the rational decision is to reject Alice's offer and purchase from John instead.
