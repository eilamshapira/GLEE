"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality and features of the product, but I was thinking of a lower price point. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you have budget considerations, but I cannot accept $8000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product is worth at least $10000 to me based on its quality and market value. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer - I can offer it to you for $14500. This represents a significant discount from my original price while still reflecting the true value of the product.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for sharing your minimum acceptable price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14500 is still above my budget. Considering your minimum price and my budget constraints, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10500. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that takes into account the product's value and my financial limitations.",10500.0,Bob,4,
