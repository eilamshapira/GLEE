Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you have budget considerations, but I cannot accept $8,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product is worth at least $10,000 to me based on its quality and market value. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer - I can offer it to you for $14,500. This represents a significant discount from my original price while still reflecting the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 14500}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for sharing your minimum acceptable price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14500 is still above my budget. Considering your minimum price and my budget constraints, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10500. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that takes into account the product's value and my financial limitations.
