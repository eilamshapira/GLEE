Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you have budget considerations, but I cannot accept $8000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product is worth at least $10000 to me based on its quality and market value. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer - I can offer it to you for $14500. This represents a significant discount from my original price while still reflecting the true value of the product.
