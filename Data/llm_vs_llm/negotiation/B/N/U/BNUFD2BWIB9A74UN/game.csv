"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is well above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and evaluation, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while being more aligned with current market conditions. I'm open to further discussion to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your perspective on the market, $1000000 significantly undervalues this product's unique capabilities and potential long-term return. I'm willing to come down to $2200000. This revised price still reflects the exceptional value this product offers while acknowledging your initial feedback.  Let me know your thoughts.",2200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $2200000 is still substantially above my budget. I understand the product's value, but I need to be practical about my investment. I can increase my offer to $1250000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the maximum value I can justify for this purchase. This offer provides fair value while being competitive with market alternatives.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to lower my price further to $1900000.  This is a substantial reduction and reflects my strong interest in closing this deal with you.  I believe this price point recognizes the true value of this product and offers you a significant return on your investment.  I encourage you to consider this seriously.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
