"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm setting the initial price at $2500000.  I'm confident you'll recognize its worth and I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll reject Alice's offer of $2,500,000 because it's significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,500,000 and even higher than John's price. Since John is offering the product at $1,500,000 (which is equal to my maximum value), I'll still have room to negotiate with Alice for a better price. If I can't get a better deal from Alice, I can always buy from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than both Alice's initial price and John's price, giving room for negotiation while still being reasonable.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,500,000 is well above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and evaluation, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while being more aligned with current market conditions. I'm open to further discussion to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your perspective on the market, $1000000 significantly undervalues this product's unique capabilities and potential long-term return. I'm willing to come down to $2200000. This revised price still reflects the exceptional value this product offers while acknowledging your initial feedback.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $2,200,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's price ($1,500,000). While Alice did reduce the price by $300,000, it's still not competitive. Since I still have several rounds of negotiation available, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice reduced her price by $300,000, I'll increase my previous offer to show willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a good bargaining position.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $2,200,000 is still substantially above my budget. I understand the product's value, but I need to be practical about my investment. I can increase my offer to $1,250,000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the maximum value I can justify for this purchase. This offer provides fair value while being competitive with market alternatives."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to lower my price further to $1900000.  This is a substantial reduction and reflects my strong interest in closing this deal with you.  I believe this price point recognizes the true value of this product and offers you a significant return on your investment.  I encourage you to consider this seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's offer of $1,900,000 is still above both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's price ($1,500,000). While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing the price further, at this point it might be more efficient to buy from John. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Alice's offers are still significantly above John's price. Rather than continue negotiating when Alice's offers remain well above my maximum value, I'll take the guaranteed option of buying from John.
