"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I'm looking for a better deal. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Would you accept this counteroffer?",100.0,Bob,2,
Bob's counteroffer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable value. I'll now propose a counteroffer in the next round in hopes of reaching a mutually agreeable price that's closer to or above $150.,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. Unfortunately, $100 is too low for this premium product. I'm willing to sell it for $180. Let me know if that works for you.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position. However, $180 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. I can increase my offer to $120. How about that?",120.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $120 is still below my acceptable price. I can sell the product to John for $150, so I'll be moving forward with that option.",,Alice,4,SellToJhon
