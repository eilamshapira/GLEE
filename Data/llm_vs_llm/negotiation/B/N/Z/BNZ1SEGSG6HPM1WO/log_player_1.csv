Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. I know the product is worth at least $80 to me, and I have a guaranteed fallback of $80 from John. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, but want to maximize my profit, I should set a price significantly above $80. However, I don't want to set it too high and risk losing a good deal if Bob's willing to pay a reasonable premium. A price of $120 would give me a 50% premium over my minimum acceptable price while still being potentially acceptable to Bob.
