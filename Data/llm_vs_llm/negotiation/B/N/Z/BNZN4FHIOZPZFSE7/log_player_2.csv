"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let's analyze the situation.

*   **Alice's offer:** $110
*   **Your Value:** $120
*   **Buy from John:** $120

Since Alice's offer is $110, which is less than your value of $120 and also less than the price from John, accepting the offer is the best option.

**Answer:** {""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
