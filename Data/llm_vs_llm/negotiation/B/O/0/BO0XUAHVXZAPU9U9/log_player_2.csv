"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","The offer of $200 is way above the maximum I'm willing to pay ($80) and also higher than the product's value to Alice ($150). Since John is offering the product at exactly $80, which is my maximum acceptable price, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If the negotiation doesn't progress favorably, I can always buy from John later.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has only reduced her offer from $200 to $180, which is still well above my maximum acceptable price of $80. Since John is offering the product at exactly $80, which is my maximum acceptable price, I should reject this offer and try one more counteroffer. If Alice doesn't come closer to my price range, I can always buy from John.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer is still double my maximum budget of $80. She has reduced her price to $160, but this is still far above what I'm willing to pay. John is offering the product for exactly $80, which matches my maximum price. Alice's offers aren't moving close enough to my acceptable range, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.
