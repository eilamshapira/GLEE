"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering the product for $10,000, which is already $2,000 less than John's price of $12,000. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible while buying the product, and this offer is already below my maximum value threshold of $12,000, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer.
