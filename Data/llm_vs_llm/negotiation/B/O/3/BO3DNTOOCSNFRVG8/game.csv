"Hello Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you. It's a high-quality item that I value at $150. I believe this is a fair price given its quality and features. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. Would you be willing to sell it to me at this price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I understand you have a budget, but $80 is below what I can accept for this item. The product is worth at least $100 to me, and I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Could you meet me at $130? This is already a significant reduction from my initial price.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for being willing to work with me. I appreciate the reduction from $150 to $130, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer of $80 and your current offer of $130. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your attempt to meet me halfway. However, I need to be transparent that I already have an offer from John for $100, which is my minimum acceptable price for this product. Given this reality, I can come down to $120, which I believe is still a fair price considering the product's quality. If we can't reach an agreement close to this price, I'll need to accept John's offer.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your transparency about John's offer. I understand your position, but I'm still hoping we can work something out. Considering you've already come down to $120 and mentioned $100 as your minimum acceptable price, I'd like to make a serious offer of $95. This is the highest I'm comfortable going, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Would you be willing to accept this price?",95.0,Bob,6,
