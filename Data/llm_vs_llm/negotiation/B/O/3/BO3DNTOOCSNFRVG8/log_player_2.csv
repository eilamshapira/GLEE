Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I understand you have a budget, but $80 is below what I can accept for this item. The product is worth at least $100 to me, and I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Could you meet me at $130? This is already a significant reduction from my initial price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your attempt to meet me halfway. However, I need to be transparent that I already have an offer from John for $100, which is my minimum acceptable price for this product. Given this reality, I can come down to $120, which I believe is still a fair price considering the product's quality. If we can't reach an agreement close to this price, I'll need to accept John's offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your transparency about John's offer. I understand your position, but I'm still hoping we can work something out. Considering you've already come down to $120 and mentioned $100 as your minimum acceptable price, I'd like to make a serious offer of $95. This is the highest I'm comfortable going, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Would you be willing to accept this price?"", ""product_price"": 95}"
