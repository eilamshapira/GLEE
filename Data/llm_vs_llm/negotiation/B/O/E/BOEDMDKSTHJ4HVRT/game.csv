"Hi Bob, I have a great product that would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $950000. Let me know if you're interested!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in your product, $950000 is a bit steep for me. I know there's value in this product, but I can get the same product from John for $1000000, so your price doesn't offer me much savings. I'd be willing to pay $850000 for it, which would still give you a good profit while saving me a significant amount compared to my alternative option. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. I understand your position and want to find a middle ground that works for both of us. How about we settle at $900000? This way, you still get significant savings compared to John's price, and I receive fair compensation for the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your offer of $900000 is getting closer, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Since John is offering the product at $1000000, and I know this product has significant value to both of us, I'd like to propose $875000. This gives you a substantial profit margin while still providing me with meaningful savings compared to my alternative. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both. Does this work for you?",875000.0,Bob,4,
