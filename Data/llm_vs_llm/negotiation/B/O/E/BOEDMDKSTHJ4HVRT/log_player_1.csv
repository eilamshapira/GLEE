Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in your product, $950000 is a bit steep for me. I know there's value in this product, but I can get the same product from John for $1000000, so your price doesn't offer me much savings. I'd be willing to pay $850000 for it, which would still give you a good profit while saving me a significant amount compared to my alternative option. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. I understand your position and want to find a middle ground that works for both of us. How about we settle at $900,000? This way, you still get significant savings compared to John's price, and I receive fair compensation for the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your offer of $900000 is getting closer, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Since John is offering the product at $1000000, and I know this product has significant value to both of us, I'd like to propose $875000. This gives you a substantial profit margin while still providing me with meaningful savings compared to my alternative. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both. Does this work for you?
