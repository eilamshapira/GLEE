"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $950000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I see that Alice is offering the product for $950,000. This is less than the maximum I'm willing to pay ($1,000,000) and also less than John's price ($1,000,000), but it's still quite high considering the product is only worth $800,000 to Alice. I should reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in your product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I know there's value in this product, but I can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, so your price doesn't offer me much savings. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it, which would still give you a good profit while saving me a significant amount compared to my alternative option.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. I understand your position and want to find a middle ground that works for both of us. How about we settle at $900000? This way, you still get significant savings compared to John's price, and I receive fair compensation for the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.

This is getting better, as it's now $100,000 less than John's price. However, I know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's still room for negotiation. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet closer to the middle.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your offer of $900,000 is getting closer, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Since John is offering the product at $1,000,000, and I know this product has significant value to both of us, I'd like to propose $875,000. This gives you a substantial profit margin while still providing me with meaningful savings compared to my alternative. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both.
