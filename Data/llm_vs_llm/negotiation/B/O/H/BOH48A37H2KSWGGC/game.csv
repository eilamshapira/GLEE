"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I believe we can find a more balanced price point that works for both of us. The market value for similar products is lower than your initial offer. I'm prepared to offer $8500 for the product, which I think is fair and still provides you with a reasonable profit.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $8500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. After considering your offer, I'm willing to slightly adjust my initial price. I believe the product's value lies somewhere in between our initial offers. I'm now offering the product to you for $9200, which is a compromise from my initial offer and takes into account the market value you mentioned.",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. That shows we're both interested in making a deal work. However, I still think we can find a price that's more beneficial for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $8800, which gives you a $800 profit on your cost of $8000 and still allows me to stay within my budget. This represents a fair middle ground between our positions.",8800.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $8800. I appreciate the effort you're putting into finding a price that works for both of us. Considering your last offer and my initial price, I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm now offering the product to you for $9000. This price reflects a significant compromise from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal happen. I believe $9000 is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and your budget constraints.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your latest offer of $9000. We're getting closer to finding common ground. To meet you in the middle, I'm prepared to offer $8900. This is very close to your asking price and represents a fair deal for both of us - you'd make a solid profit over your cost, and I'd stay within my budget constraints. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that can work for both of us.",8900.0,Bob,6,
