Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I believe we can find a more balanced price point that works for both of us. The market value for similar products is lower than your initial offer. I'm prepared to offer $8500 for the product, which I think is fair and still provides you with a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,500 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($8,000) and closer to my initial offer, but still lower than my desired sale price, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my initial offer, trying to meet Bob halfway.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $8,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. After considering your offer, I'm willing to slightly adjust my initial price. I believe the product's value lies somewhere in between our initial offers. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,200, which is a compromise from my initial offer and takes into account the market value you mentioned."", ""product_price"": 9200}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. That shows we're both interested in making a deal work. However, I still think we can find a price that's more beneficial for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $8800, which gives you a $800 profit on your cost of $8000 and still allows me to stay within my budget. This represents a fair middle ground between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer of $8,800 is getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with, but it's still below my desired sale price. Since I have 6 rounds left to negotiate and Bob is showing willingness to increase his offer, I'll reject his current offer and try to meet him closer to the middle of our initial prices.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $8,800. I appreciate the effort you're putting into finding a price that works for both of us. Considering your last offer and my initial price, I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your latest offer of $9000. We're getting closer to finding common ground. To meet you in the middle, I'm prepared to offer $8900. This is very close to your asking price and represents a fair deal for both of us - you'd make a solid profit over your cost, and I'd stay within my budget constraints. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that can work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer of $8,900 is very close to my last counteroffer of $9,000, and it's clear that he's making a genuine effort to meet me in the middle. Considering that I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer, and Bob's offer is only $100 away from my last price, I think it's reasonable to accept his offer. Accepting $8,900 will still provide me with a good profit and ensure that the deal is closed efficiently.
