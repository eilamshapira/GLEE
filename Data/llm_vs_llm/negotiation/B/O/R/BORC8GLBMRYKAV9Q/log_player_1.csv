"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional quality and the benefits it provides, I'm confident that it's worth $10,000."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I was hoping to stay within a tighter budget. Would you consider selling it for $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

# Explanation: Since Bob is willing to pay $8,000, there's a chance he might be willing to pay more. If we reject his offer, we might be able to sell the product for a higher price. If we accept his offer, we would be selling the product for the minimum amount we're willing to accept. If we sell to John, we would also be selling the product for the minimum amount we're willing to accept. Therefore, it's worth trying to negotiate with Bob to see if he would be willing to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that you have a budget to consider, but I believe the product's value is higher than your offer. Let's meet in the middle at $9,000."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I have a limited budget to work with. Let's settle for $8500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

# Explanation: Bob has increased his offer to $8,500, which is $500 more than the minimum we're willing to accept. If we reject his offer, there's a chance he might not be willing to pay more, and we might lose the sale. If we sell to John, we would be selling the product for less than Bob's offer. Therefore, it's better to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $8,500."
