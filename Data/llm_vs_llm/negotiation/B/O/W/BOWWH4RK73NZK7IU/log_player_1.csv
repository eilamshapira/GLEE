"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the same as John's offer ($12,000) and it's also my minimum acceptable price, I'll reject it and make a counteroffer. There's no risk in continuing negotiation since I can always fall back to John's offer, and Bob might be willing to pay more.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still maintain a good margin above my minimum price.
