"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $18,000 is higher than what I can get from John ($15,000), so it wouldn't make sense to accept it. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to negotiate a better price with Alice. If we can't reach an agreement below $15,000, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 12000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $12,000. This is significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer and John's price, which gives room for negotiation. If Alice counter-offers, we can potentially meet somewhere in between, hopefully below $15,000. If we can't reach an agreement below $15,000, I still have the option to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $15,000. Here's why:
1. The price has come down significantly from the initial $18,000
2. It's the same price as John's offer
3. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice would go lower, and we might risk losing this price point
4. This price matches my maximum value for the product ($15,000)

Since we've reached a price that matches the best alternative (John's offer), it's reasonable to accept and conclude the negotiation."
