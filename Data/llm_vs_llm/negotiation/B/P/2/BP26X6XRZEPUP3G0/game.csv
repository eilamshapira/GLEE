"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $15000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, which is what I can get it for elsewhere. However, I'd like to give you a chance to make this deal work. I can offer you $7000 for the product, which would save me some money compared to my alternative option and still give you a sale. Let me know if this works for you.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7000 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand your budget constraints, I need to be transparent that my absolute minimum price is $12000, which reflects the true market value and my costs. I can offer it to you for $13000, which is already a reduction from my initial offer. This price better reflects the product's actual value while still giving you room for a good return on your investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $13000 is still well above what makes economic sense for me. You mentioned your minimum is $12000, but I need to be clear that the product is only worth $8000 to me - that's my ceiling. In fact, I can purchase the same product from another seller for exactly $8000. Since I'd prefer to do business with you, I'm willing to offer $7500, which would be a win for me while still giving you a sale. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to go with my alternative option.",7500.0,Bob,4,
