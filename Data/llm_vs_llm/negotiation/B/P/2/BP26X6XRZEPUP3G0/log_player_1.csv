"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $15000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, which is what I can get it for elsewhere. However, I'd like to give you a chance to make this deal work. I can offer you $7000 for the product, which would save me some money compared to my alternative option and still give you a sale. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $7,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and considering I have John's guaranteed offer of $12,000, I'll reject this offer. However, I'll continue negotiating with Bob for now to see if we can reach a more favorable price before deciding to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand your budget constraints, I need to be transparent that my absolute minimum price is $12,000, which reflects the true market value and my costs. I can offer it to you for $13,000, which is already a reduction from my initial offer. This price better reflects the product's actual value while still giving you room for a good return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $13000 is still well above what makes economic sense for me. You mentioned your minimum is $12000, but I need to be clear that the product is only worth $8000 to me - that's my ceiling. In fact, I can purchase the same product from another seller for exactly $8000. Since I'd prefer to do business with you, I'm willing to offer $7500, which would be a win for me while still giving you a sale. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to go with my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Given that Bob has clearly stated the product is only worth $8,000 to him and he won't go higher, and considering I have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000 (which is my minimum acceptable price), it makes the most economic sense to sell to John. Further negotiation with Bob would be futile since there's no possibility of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement - the gap between his maximum ($8,000) and my minimum ($12,000) is too large to bridge."
