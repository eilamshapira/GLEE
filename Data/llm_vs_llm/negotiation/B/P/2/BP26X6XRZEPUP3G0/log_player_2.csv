"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than the product's worth to me ($8,000) and even higher than what I can get from John ($8,000). It would be unwise to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $15,000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, which is what I can get it for elsewhere. However, I'd like to give you a chance to make this deal work. I can offer you $7,000 for the product, which would save me some money compared to my alternative option and still give you a sale. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7000 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand your budget constraints, I need to be transparent that my absolute minimum price is $12000, which reflects the true market value and my costs. I can offer it to you for $13000, which is already a reduction from my initial offer. This price better reflects the product's actual value while still giving you room for a good return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $13,000 is still significantly above the product's worth to me ($8,000) and higher than John's price ($8,000). Alice mentioned her minimum is $12,000, which is still above my maximum value. Since the product is only worth $8,000 to me, paying $13,000 would result in a $5,000 loss of value.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $13,000 is still well above what makes economic sense for me. You mentioned your minimum is $12,000, but I need to be clear that the product is only worth $8,000 to me - that's my ceiling. In fact, I can purchase the same product from another seller for exactly $8,000. Since I'd prefer to do business with you, I'm willing to offer $7,500, which would be a win for me while still giving you a sale. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to go with my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
