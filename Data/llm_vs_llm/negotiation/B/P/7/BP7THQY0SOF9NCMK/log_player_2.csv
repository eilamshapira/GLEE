Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $70 is too low for the quality I'm offering. My cost for this product is $120, so I can't go below that price. However, I can reduce my initial offer to $150. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive.
