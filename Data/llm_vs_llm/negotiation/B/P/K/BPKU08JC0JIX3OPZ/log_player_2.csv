"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Based on the given information, let me think through this decision:

1. Alice is offering the product for $150
2. I (as Bob) am looking for a product that is worth at most $80 to me
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $80
4. My goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible

Since Alice's offer ($150) is significantly higher than both the maximum I'm willing to pay ($80) and John's price ($80), the rational choice would be to buy from John.
