"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that we have different valuations of the product. I'm willing to negotiate and find a price that works for both of us. Considering your offer of $6000, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer that splits the difference between my initial offer and your counteroffer, while also taking into account the minimum value I have for the product.",10000.0,Alice,3,
