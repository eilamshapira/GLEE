Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you for a competitive price.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your position, but based on my budget and the value I see in the product, I'm currently prepared to offer $6000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is below my minimum threshold of $10,000 and also below the value I believe the product holds, I will not accept his offer. Additionally, selling to John for $10,000 is an option that guarantees a sale at a price I am comfortable with, but I am interested in exploring if I can get a better deal from Bob or if he is willing to increase his offer.

Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of finding a mutually agreeable price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that we have different valuations of the product. I'm willing to negotiate and find a price that works for both of us. Considering your offer of $6,000, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer that splits the difference between my initial offer and your counteroffer, while also taking into account the minimum value I have for the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've reconsidered and I'm willing to raise my offer to $7000. This is closer to my maximum budget, and I hope it's a price you find more acceptable. Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's new offer of $7,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. While it's closer to what I'm looking for, it doesn't meet my requirements. Given that Bob has raised his offer twice, it seems he's interested in the product, but the gap between his offer and my minimum acceptable price is still significant.

At this point, I have to consider the certainty of selling the product to John for $10,000, which meets my minimum threshold. Continuing to negotiate with Bob may not yield a better result, and I risk losing the opportunity to sell to John if I wait too long.

Therefore, I've decided to sell the product to John, as his offer of $10,000 is more in line with what I'm looking for and provides a guaranteed sale.
