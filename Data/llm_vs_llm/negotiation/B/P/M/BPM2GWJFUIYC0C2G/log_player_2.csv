# Your message to Alice:
Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm looking to spend no more than $8,000. Would you be willing to lower your price? Let's discuss further and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

I'm willing to buy the product for $6,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that we have different valuations of the product. I'm willing to negotiate and find a price that works for both of us. Considering your offer of $6000, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer that splits the difference between my initial offer and your counteroffer, while also taking into account the minimum value I have for the product.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

# Your message to Alice:
Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is still too high for me. I'm looking to spend no more than $8,000 for the product. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I need it to be closer to my budget. Let's keep negotiating to find a middle ground.

# Your counteroffer:
I'm willing to buy the product for $7,000."
