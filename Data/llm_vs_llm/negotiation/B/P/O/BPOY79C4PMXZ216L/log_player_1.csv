I choose to **reject** Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

Given the product's value to Bob ($15,000) and the fact that John is offering $12,000, I'll continue negotiating.

However, I still believe I can push for a slightly higher price. I also need to consider the risk of losing the deal entirely if I push too hard.

Given that I'm still above my minimum price, I'll try one last time to get a better offer.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob is repeating his offer of $13,000. I've pushed as hard as I can, and he's clearly not budging. I need to evaluate whether I'm better off selling to Bob at $13,000 or selling to John for $12,000. The difference is $1,000. I also have limited rounds to close the deal.

I believe it's best to sell to Bob at this point.
