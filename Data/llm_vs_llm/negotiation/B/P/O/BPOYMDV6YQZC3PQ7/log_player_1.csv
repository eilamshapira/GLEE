"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start by making a relatively high offer to maximize my potential earnings. I can always adjust my price later based on Bob's response.

{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $5,000 is lower than the minimum value of $8,000 that I'm willing to accept, and I have the option to sell to John for $8,000, I won't accept Bob's offer.

However, I still want to try to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. So, I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $5,000, which is quite low, I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my initial offer of $12,000. However, I'll also consider the fact that I have a safety net of $8,000 from John, so I won't go too low.

Let's calculate a counteroffer: ($12,000 + $5,000) / 2 = $8,500, but I'll add a bit more to give myself room for further negotiation.

{""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer of $6,500 is still lower than I'd like, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. However, it's still lower than the $8,000 that I can get from John.

At this point, I'm not sure if Bob is willing to go higher, but I'm willing to try to negotiate a bit more. Since Bob's offer is increasing, it's possible that he's interested in the product and might be willing to pay more.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to make a counteroffer that's closer to my target price, while also considering the fact that I have a safety net of $8,000 from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $6,500, and I previously offered $10,000, I'll try to find a middle ground. I'll also consider the fact that Bob's offers are increasing, which suggests that he's interested in the product.

Let's calculate a counteroffer: ($10,000 + $6,500) / 2 = $8,250. This price is closer to my target, and it's also higher than John's offer of $8,000.

{""product_price"": 8250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer of $7,000 is still lower than my previous counteroffer of $8,250, but it's getting closer to the price that I can get from John, which is $8,000.

At this point, I'm starting to think that Bob might not be willing to go much higher, and I'm not sure if I want to risk losing the sale by holding out for a higher price. Since Bob's offer is only $1,000 lower than John's offer, I'm inclined to sell to John, who is offering a guaranteed price.

However, I'll give Bob one more chance to meet me at a price that's closer to my target. If he's not willing to budge, I'll sell to John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $7,000, and I'm considering selling to John for $8,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's close to John's price. This will give Bob a chance to meet me at a price that's acceptable to me, and it will also show him that I'm serious about selling the product for a price that's close to its value.
