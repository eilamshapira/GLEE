"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

```json
{""product_price"": 25000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Starting High:** Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm starting with a significantly high price. I want to gauge his interest and willingness to negotiate. This gives me room to come down later if needed.
*   **Anchoring Effect:** Offering a high initial price can create an anchoring effect, potentially making Bob think the product is worth more than he initially believed.
*   **Walk-Away Option:** I always have John at $15,000. I need to try and get more than that with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $5,000 is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Selling to John is a much better option than accepting that offer. Therefore, I will reject and try to negotiate a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 23000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Significant Reduction, But Still High:** I'm lowering the price significantly from my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm still keeping it well above my minimum of $15,000.
*   **Testing the Waters:** This price point allows me to see how serious Bob is. Is he truly interested, or is he just trying to lowball me? A response to this price will give me more information about his potential valuation.
*   **Avoiding the Race to the Bottom:** I don't want to immediately jump to a price closer to my minimum. I need to see if Bob is willing to come up from his initial low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $7,000 is still far too low. It's not even close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Selling to John remains a far better option. I will reject and try to negotiate a better price from Bob one more time. If he does not come up on the next round, I will sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Another Significant Reduction:** I'm lowering the price again, demonstrating further flexibility and a willingness to meet Bob somewhere in the middle (though still far from his current offer).
*   **Possibly the Last Attempt:** I am seriously considering selling the product to John if Bob rejects this offer and doesn't increase his offer by much.
*   **Information Gathering:** I'm still hoping to get a better sense of Bob's true valuation. A response to $20,000 will give me valuable insight."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is still ridiculously low. It's clear he's not willing to come close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a worthwhile result. I'm better off selling to John for $15,000 and cutting my losses."
