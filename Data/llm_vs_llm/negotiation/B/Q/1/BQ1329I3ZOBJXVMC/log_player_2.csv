"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $160. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'll analyze the situation:
1. Alice's offer is $160
2. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
3. John is offering the same product for $120
4. Alice's offer ($160) is higher than both:
   - My maximum value ($120)
   - John's alternative price ($120)

Since Alice's price is significantly above my maximum value and higher than John's offer, there's no reason to accept this offer or continue negotiating. The best decision is to buy from John.
