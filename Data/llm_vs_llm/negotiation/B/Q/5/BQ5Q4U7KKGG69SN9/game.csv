"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on pricing, I need to consider the true value of what I'm offering. Given the quality and benefits this product provides, I can reduce my asking price to $1050000. This is significantly below my initial offer and represents excellent value given the product's capabilities and market position. I hope we can work together to find a price that recognizes the product's worth while meeting your budget constraints.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
