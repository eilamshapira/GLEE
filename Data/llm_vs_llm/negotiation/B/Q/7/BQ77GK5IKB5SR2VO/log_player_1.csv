Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $15,000 to him and $8,000 to me, I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

{""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","The offer of $11,000 is significantly higher than John's $8,000, but there might still be room to negotiate for a better price since it's worth $15,000 to Bob. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial $13,500, but still try to get a good profit. I'll aim for a price between Bob's offer ($11,000) and my initial ask.

{""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob has lowered his offer from $11,000 to $10,000, which suggests he's becoming less willing to negotiate upward. While $10,000 is still better than John's $8,000, I'll try one more counter-offer. However, if Bob continues to decrease his offers, I might need to accept soon to avoid risking losing the better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Given that Bob has lowered his offer twice now, I'll make a more modest counteroffer to try to reach an agreement while still securing a good profit.

{""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offers are consistently decreasing ($11,000 → $10,000 → $9,500), which suggests continuing to negotiate might lead to even lower offers. While $9,500 is not as high as I hoped for, it's still $1,500 better than John's offer of $8,000. At this point, it's safer to accept this offer rather than risk further deterioration of the price.
