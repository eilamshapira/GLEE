"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to present you with an exclusive opportunity to purchase my premium product. This product has exceptional quality and value, and I'm offering it to you at $21500. This price reflects the product's true market value and the unique benefits it will bring to you. I have another interested buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at $15000, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $21,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $21,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Looking at this situation:

1) Alice is offering the product for $21,500
2) The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
3) I can buy the same product from John for $8,000

Since Alice's price ($21,500) is significantly higher than both the product's value to me and John's price, the rational choice is to buy from John.
