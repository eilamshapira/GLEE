"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you, Alice, for the offer. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $5000 to purchase it.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you, Bob, for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $5000 is below its true value. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $17000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I believe this is a fair price, given the product's uniqueness and worth.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price, but $17000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $6000, considering my budget constraints.",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your revised offer, but $6000 is still below the product's value. I'm willing to make another compromise to try to reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll offer the product to you for $15000, which is a further reduction from my previous price. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's uniqueness and worth. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and finalize the deal.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you, Alice, for trying to work with me on the price. However, $15000 is still outside my budget range. I can offer $7000, which is the highest I can go given my constraints.",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your revised offer, and I understand that you're trying to work within your budget constraints. However, $7000 is still below the product's value. Considering the progress we've made so far, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $12000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a serious attempt to meet you halfway and finalize the deal. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I may need to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,7,
