"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you, Alice, for the offer. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $5000 to purchase it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $5,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. Selling to John for $10,000 is a better option than accepting Bob's offer, but I want to try to negotiate a better price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you, Bob, for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $5,000 is below its true value. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $17,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I believe this is a fair price, given the product's uniqueness and worth."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price, but $17000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $6000, considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $6,000 is still significantly lower than the product's value to me. While he has increased his offer, it's not enough to meet my expectations. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer. Selling to John for $10,000 remains a better option than accepting Bob's offer, but I want to continue negotiating with Bob to try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your revised offer, but $6,000 is still below the product's value. I'm willing to make another compromise to try to reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll offer the product to you for $15,000, which is a further reduction from my previous price. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's uniqueness and worth. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you, Alice, for trying to work with me on the price. However, $15000 is still outside my budget range. I can offer $7000, which is the highest I can go given my constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $7,000 is still lower than the product's value to me, and it's also lower than the alternative offer from John. While Bob has increased his offer again, it's not enough to meet my expectations. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer. However, I'll need to consider the remaining rounds and the likelihood of reaching a better price with Bob. If the negotiation doesn't improve, I may need to consider selling to John for $10,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your revised offer, and I understand that you're trying to work within your budget constraints. However, $7,000 is still below the product's value. Considering the progress we've made so far, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $12,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a serious attempt to meet you halfway and finalize the deal. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I may need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
