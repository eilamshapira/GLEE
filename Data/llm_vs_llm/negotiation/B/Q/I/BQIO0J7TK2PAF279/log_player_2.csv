"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. However, I believe the product's value is higher than your offer. Let's meet in the middle at $1050000. This way, we both gain significantly from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Alice's counteroffer is still above my ideal price, but it's a reasonable compromise. I'm better off accepting this offer than risking a further negotiation or going with John's higher price."
