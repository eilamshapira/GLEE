"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I am offering you this valuable product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is close to my maximum budget of $1,500,000, but still below it, I think I can try to negotiate a better price. The product is only worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so there might be some room for negotiation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, I'll aim for a price that is closer to that value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Bob. I understand your position, but this product holds significant value. How about we meet somewhere in the middle at $1400000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but it's getting closer to a reasonable price. Since Alice rejected my previous offer of $1,200,000, I know she's not willing to go that low. However, I still think there's some room for negotiation.

I'll try to split the difference between my previous offer and Alice's new offer. A price of $1,300,000 would be a compromise, and it's still below my maximum budget of $1,500,000.
