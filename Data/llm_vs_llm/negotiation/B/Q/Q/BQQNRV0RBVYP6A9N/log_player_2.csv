(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'll analyze this offer:

Alice's offer: $180
My maximum value: $80
John's price: $80

This offer is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's alternative price. There's no reason to accept a price that's $100 more than my alternative option.
