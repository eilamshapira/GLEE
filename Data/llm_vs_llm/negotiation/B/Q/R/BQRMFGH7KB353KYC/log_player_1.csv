"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer, considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob and $1,000,000 to me.

{""product_price"": 1,150,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","While $1,100,000 is a decent offer and better than John's $1,000,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer slightly but still try to capture more value since Bob values the product at $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob has lowered his offer from $1,100,000 to $1,080,000, which shows he's bargaining aggressively. While this is still better than John's offer, we're now in round 4 of 10, and Bob's offers are trending downward. I will reject this offer and make one more attempt at a counteroffer, but I need to be careful not to let the negotiation deteriorate too much.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Given that Bob's offers are trending downward and we're halfway through our rounds, I'll make a more moderate counteroffer to try to find a middle ground.

{""product_price"": 1,110,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offers are consistently decreasing ($1,100,000 → $1,080,000 → $1,050,000), and we're now in round 6 of 10. This pattern suggests he might continue to lower his offers. While $1,050,000 is still better than John's $1,000,000, the risk of further deterioration in offers and potentially ending up with a worse deal is increasing. I'll accept this offer now.
