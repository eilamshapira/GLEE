"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $120 to me and only $80 to Bob, I should make an initial high offer knowing that I can always fall back on John's guaranteed $120 offer if negotiations with Bob fail.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $70 is well below my minimum value of $120, and even below his own value of $80, I will reject this offer. Given that I have John's guaranteed offer of $120, there's no reason to accept anything lower.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's previous offer was very low at $70, I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still keep it well above my minimum value of $120, as I can always fall back on John's offer.

{""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's new offer of $75 is still well below my minimum acceptable value of $120, and barely higher than his previous offer. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, there's no reason to continue negotiating with offers this low. At this point, it's clear that Bob is not willing to offer a price that would be acceptable to me, so I'll take John's offer.
