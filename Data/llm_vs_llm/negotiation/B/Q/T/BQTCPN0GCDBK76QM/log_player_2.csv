"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since the product is only worth $80 to me and Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's alternative price of $80, I'll reject this offer. In the next round, I can make a counteroffer that's more reasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

I'll offer $70, which is slightly below both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). This gives some room for negotiation while still potentially allowing for a deal that benefits both parties. If Alice rejects this, I can gradually increase my offer in subsequent rounds, but I'll always have the option to go to John at $80 if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has lowered her price from $150 to $130, which shows some willingness to negotiate, but it's still way above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). It makes no sense to accept this offer when I can either continue negotiating or buy from John for $80. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 75}

I'll slightly increase my offer to $75. This is still below my maximum value and John's price of $80, but shows I'm willing to move up from my previous offer of $70. Since the product is worth $120 to Alice, there's still room for her to make a profit, even at this price. If Alice doesn't accept this or come back with a reasonable counter, I can always fall back on John's offer of $80."
