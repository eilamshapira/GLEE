"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find $25000 to be significantly above market value for this product. Based on my market research and comparable products, I would be willing to offer $8500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's actual value while still being competitive. I look forward to your response.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the time you took to research the market and make a competitive offer. However, I must say that $8500 is a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. Considering the product's exceptional quality and potential benefits, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer it to you for $22000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I believe this price is more in line with the product's true value, and I'm open to further negotiations.",22000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and the reduction in price. However, $22000 is still substantially above market value. While I understand you value the product's quality, I've done extensive market research and can find similar products for much less. I can increase my offer to $9200, which is a fair price that reflects both the product's quality and current market conditions. This represents a reasonable increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my serious interest in reaching a deal.",9200.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price and your serious interest in reaching a deal. However, I still believe that $9200 doesn't accurately reflect the product's value. Considering your extensive market research, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'd like to offer the product to you for $20000, which is a further reduction from my previous price. I believe this price is more competitive while still reflecting the product's exceptional quality and potential benefits. I'm open to further negotiations and look forward to your response.",20000.0,Alice,5,
