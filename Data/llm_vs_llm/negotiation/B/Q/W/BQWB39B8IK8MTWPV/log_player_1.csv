"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $25,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's quality and potential benefits. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find $25000 to be significantly above market value for this product. Based on my market research and comparable products, I would be willing to offer $8500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's actual value while still being competitive. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $8,500 is significantly lower than my initial price and even lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob, and I'm not ready to settle for an offer that is almost half of what I can get from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the time you took to research the market and make a competitive offer. However, I must say that $8,500 is a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. Considering the product's exceptional quality and potential benefits, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer it to you for $22,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I believe this price is more in line with the product's true value, and I'm open to further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and the reduction in price. However, $22000 is still substantially above market value. While I understand you value the product's quality, I've done extensive market research and can find similar products for much less. I can increase my offer to $9200, which is a fair price that reflects both the product's quality and current market conditions. This represents a reasonable increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my serious interest in reaching a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $9,200 is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept, and it's also lower than what John is willing to pay. I believe I can continue to negotiate with Bob to reach a better price. Since Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, I'll continue to make counteroffers to try to find a mutually acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price and your serious interest in reaching a deal. However, I still believe that $9,200 doesn't accurately reflect the product's value. Considering your extensive market research, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'd like to offer the product to you for $20,000, which is a further reduction from my previous price. I believe this price is more competitive while still reflecting the product's exceptional quality and potential benefits. I'm open to further negotiations and look forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
