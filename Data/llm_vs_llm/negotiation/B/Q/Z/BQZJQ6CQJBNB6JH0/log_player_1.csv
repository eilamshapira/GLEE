"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $40. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $40
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $40 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I have the option to sell to John for $150, I will not accept Bob's offer.

However, I will also not sell to John just yet, as I want to try to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.

So, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $40, I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my initial offer of $150. However, I'll also keep in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $150, so I won't go too low.

My counteroffer will be:

{""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $45. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $45
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's new offer of $45 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Since I have the option to sell to John for $150, which is a much better deal for me, I don't see a need to continue negotiating with Bob at such a low price.

However, I'll give Bob one more chance to increase his offer to a more reasonable price. If he's not willing to meet me at a higher price, I'll sell to John.

My decision for now is to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $45, and I previously offered $140, I'll try to slightly reduce my price to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement. However, I won't reduce it too much, as I still have the option to sell to John for $150.

My counteroffer will be:

{""product_price"": 135}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's new offer of $50 is still very low compared to my minimum acceptable price of $150. At this point, I'm not seeing much movement from Bob, and I'm starting to think that we may not be able to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.

Given that I have the option to sell to John for $150, which is a much better deal for me, I'm inclined to stop negotiating with Bob and sell to John instead. Continuing to negotiate with Bob may not yield a better result, and I risk wasting more time.

My decision is to sell the product to John for $150.
