"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to consider my options carefully here.

Alice is offering the product for $800,000, which is the same price that John is offering. This is also the maximum amount the product is worth to me.

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price, and this is my maximum valuation, there's no advantage in accepting Alice's current offer over buying from John. However, by rejecting and making a counteroffer, I might be able to get a better price from Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's asking price to give room for negotiation, while still being somewhat reasonable.
