"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer is the same price as John's offer ($15,000), and this is just the first round, it makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a better price with Alice. If we can't get a better deal later, we can always buy from John at $15,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since we're looking for a product worth no more than $15,000 to us, and we want to save money, let's start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation. A reasonable starting point would be around 60% of the maximum price.

{""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has significantly reduced the price from $15,000 to $12,000, which is a substantial $3,000 savings compared to John's price. Since we're only in round 3 and Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by making a significant reduction, we can try one more counter to see if we can get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $15,000 to $12,000, showing willingness to negotiate, and we started at $9,000, let's meet closer to the middle but still try to save a bit more. Let's offer $10,500, which is halfway between our last offer and Alice's current offer.
