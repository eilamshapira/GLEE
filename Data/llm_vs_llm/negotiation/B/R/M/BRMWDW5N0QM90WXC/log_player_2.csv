"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'm currently being offered the product at $12,000 from Alice, which is the same price that John is selling it for, and also equal to my maximum valuation. There's no advantage to accepting Alice's current offer since I could get the same deal from John.

I should try to negotiate a better price with Alice first, as the product is worth $12,000 to her as well, so there might be room for negotiation.
