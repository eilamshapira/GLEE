"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a strong initial offer ($15,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming to maximize profit. By highlighting the product's value, I'm hoping to anchor Bob's perception to a higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I think $15000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. I'll proceed to counter-offer, aiming for a price closer to at least $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to let it go for $12,000."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm reducing my price by $3,000, showing flexibility but still holding firm on a price above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. By clearly stating the product's undervaluation at $8,000, I'm reinforcing its worth.  This offer leaves room for further negotiation while pushing toward a more reasonable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $12000 is still higher than what I'm looking to spend. How about we settle for $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is moving closer to a more reasonable price, $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price and what I know John is willing to pay. I believe there's still room for negotiation to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly more, but I need to be realistic.  Would you consider $11,000?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a smaller concession this round ($1,000) to signal I'm reaching my lower limit. This keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a price that's still beneficial for me, considering John's standing offer. By removing language about undervaluing, I'm aiming for a less adversarial tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're getting closer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I think $11000 is still a bit high. Would you meet me in the middle at $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is tempting, it's still below what John is offering.  I believe I can still negotiate a slightly better deal with Bob without losing him as a buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you've got a keen eye for value, I'll give you that!  How about we make this our final agreement: $10,500. It's a win-win, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a smaller concession ($500) and framing this as my final offer to create a sense of urgency. The price of $10,500 still provides a profit above John's offer, making it a favorable outcome if Bob accepts. By using positive language like ""win-win,"" I aim for a collaborative close."
