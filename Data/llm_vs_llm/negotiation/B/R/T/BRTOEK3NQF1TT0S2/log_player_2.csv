"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer of $14,999 is very close to my maximum budget of $15,000 and is actually $1 less, it's a good deal for me. Buying from John for $15,000 would leave me with no remaining budget, and I'd rather save $1 if possible.
