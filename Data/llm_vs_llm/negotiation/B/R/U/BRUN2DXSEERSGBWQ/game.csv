"Hi Alice, while I appreciate the value of the product, $1500000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it. Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, I cannot accept $800000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1200000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your response, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but $1200000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $900000? This is a fair increase from my last offer and should still be within a reasonable range for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
