Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its significant market value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while I appreciate the value of the product, $1500000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer to Bob since $800,000 is below the minimum value I'm willing to accept ($1,000,000), and I can get a better price by either negotiating with Bob or selling to John. Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, I cannot accept $800,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your response, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but $1200000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $900000? This is a fair increase from my last offer and should still be within a reasonable range for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

I will sell to John for $1,000,000. Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below what I can get from John, and given that Bob's increases in offers are relatively small ($100,000 from his first offer), it seems unlikely that he will exceed John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 in future negotiations. Taking John's offer is the most profitable and secure option."
