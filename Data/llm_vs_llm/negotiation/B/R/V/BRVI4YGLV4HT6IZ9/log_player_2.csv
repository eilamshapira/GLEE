"Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and Alice's offer of $175 is higher than both my maximum value and John's price of $150, the rational decision would be to buy from John.
