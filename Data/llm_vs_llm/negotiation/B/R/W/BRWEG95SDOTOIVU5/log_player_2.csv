"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you an exclusive product that I believe could be a great fit for you. After careful consideration, I'm asking for $1500000. I think youâ€™ll find this product to be a valuable investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Let me think about this:

1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $800,000
4. If I accept Alice's offer, I would be paying $700,000 more than my maximum value
5. If I buy from John, I would pay exactly my maximum value

Since Alice's offer ($1,500,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000), the logical choice is to buy from John.
