"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is far too low, being significantly below even my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round, lowering my initial price but still maintaining a good margin above my minimum.

{""product_price"": 1,700,000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000}"
