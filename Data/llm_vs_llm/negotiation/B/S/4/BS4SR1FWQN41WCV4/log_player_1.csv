(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","This is a tough spot. $100 is less than what I need to make to break even ($120). However, I can't let Bob know how bad my position is. I also don't know how much Bob values the product. I have to play it cool.

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.
