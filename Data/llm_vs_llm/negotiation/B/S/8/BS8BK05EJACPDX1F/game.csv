"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $1050000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm still open to negotiations, and I'd like to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks Alice, I'm still interested. I'm willing to go up to $1075000. That's my final offer.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not quite there. Considering you mentioned $1075000 is your final offer, I'll make a serious concession to try to close the deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1090000, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
