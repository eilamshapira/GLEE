"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $220 is quite steep for me. The product is worth about $150 to me, which is what another seller (John) is offering. I'd like to buy from you instead if possible. Would you consider $130? That would give me a reason to choose you over the other seller.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I value the product a bit higher. How about we meet in the middle at $185?",185.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that, but I still need to be practical here. John is offering the exact same product for $150, which is already the maximum value of this item to me. For me to choose you over John, I'd need to get it for less. I can offer you $140 - that still saves me $10 compared to John's price while giving you a quick sale.",140.0,Bob,4,
