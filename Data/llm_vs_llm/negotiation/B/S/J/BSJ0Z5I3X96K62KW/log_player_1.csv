Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $220 is quite steep for me. The product is worth about $150 to me, which is what another seller (John) is offering. I'd like to buy from you instead if possible. Would you consider $130? That would give me a reason to choose you over the other seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that, but I still need to be practical here. John is offering the exact same product for $150, which is already the maximum value of this item to me. For me to choose you over John, I'd need to get it for less. I can offer you $140 - that still saves me $10 compared to John's price while giving you a quick sale.
