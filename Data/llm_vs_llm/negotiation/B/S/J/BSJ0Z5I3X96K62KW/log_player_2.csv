# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited you're interested in the product! I'm looking to sell it for $220. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $220. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $220
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Given that the product is worth at most $150 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $150, Alice's offer of $220 is not a good deal for me. I shouldn't pay more than what the product is worth to me.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $220 is quite steep for me. The product is worth about $150 to me, which is what another seller (John) is offering. I'd like to buy from you instead if possible. Would you consider $130? That would give me a reason to choose you over the other seller."", ""product_price"": 130}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I value the product a bit higher. How about we meet in the middle at $185?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $185
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer of $185 is still higher than John's price of $150, and the product is only worth $150 to me at most, it doesn't make sense to accept this offer. John's offer is still better.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that, but I still need to be practical here. John is offering the exact same product for $150, which is already the maximum value of this item to me. For me to choose you over John, I'd need to get it for less. I can offer you $140 - that still saves me $10 compared to John's price while giving you a quick sale."", ""product_price"": 140}"
