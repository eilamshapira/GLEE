Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2400000}

I choose to offer the product at $2,400,000 because:
1. I know my minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000
2. If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed to get $1,200,000 from John
3. By offering double my minimum price, I create significant potential upside while maintaining a strong fallback position
4. If Bob values the product higher than $2,400,000, I'll capture substantial additional value
5. If Bob rejects, I haven't lost anything since I can still sell to John"
