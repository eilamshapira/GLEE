"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1300000 is significantly above market value for this product. I know the fair market value is much lower. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product, which I believe is a reasonable price that could work for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product's value and its unique features truly justify a higher price. I'm willing to lower my offer to $1200000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice. However, $1200000 is still well above what I can justify paying. I can increase my offer to $925000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the product's true market value. This would be a profitable deal for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. To find a middle ground, how about $1100000? I believe this is more aligned with the product's value and can be a win-win for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your continued negotiation and price reduction, Alice. Your movement shows you're serious about making a deal. I can increase my offer to $975000, which is very close to market value. This is nearly a $50000 increase from my last offer and would give you a good profit margin while still being fair to both parties.",975000.0,Bob,6,
