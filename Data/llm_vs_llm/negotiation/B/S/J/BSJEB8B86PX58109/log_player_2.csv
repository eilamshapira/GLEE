"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze the situation:
1. Alice's offer is $1,300,000
2. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me
3. John's fixed price is $1,000,000
4. We have 10 rounds for negotiation

Alice's initial offer ($1,300,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price. It would be unwise to accept this offer when I can either:
1. Try to negotiate with Alice for a better price
2. Buy from John at $1,000,000

Since we have plenty of negotiation rounds left, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's well below Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,300,000 is significantly above market value for this product. I know the fair market value is much lower. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a reasonable price that could work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product's value and its unique features truly justify a higher price. I'm willing to lower my offer to $1200000. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze the updated situation:
1. Alice's new offer is $1,200,000 (reduced by $100,000 from initial offer)
2. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me
3. John's fixed price is $1,000,000
4. We still have several rounds for negotiation

While Alice has moved down in price, $1,200,000 is still above both my maximum value and John's price. There's no reason to accept an offer that's higher than my alternative option with John. Since Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing her price, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $100,000 from her initial offer, I'll also adjust my offer upward to show good faith in the negotiation, but still keep it well below my maximum value.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is still well above what I can justify paying. I can increase my offer to $925,000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the product's true market value. This would be a profitable deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. To find a middle ground, how about $1100000? I believe this is more aligned with the product's value and can be a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze the current situation:
1. Alice's new offer is $1,100,000 (down another $100,000)
2. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me
3. John's fixed price is $1,000,000
4. We're halfway through our negotiation rounds

While Alice continues to move down in price, her offer of $1,100,000 is still higher than both my maximum value and John's price. Even though we're making progress in the negotiation, there's still no reason to accept a price that's higher than my alternative with John. Since Alice has shown consistent willingness to reduce her price, I'll continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has been consistently moving down by $100,000 each time, showing good faith in the negotiation. I should also make a meaningful increase in my offer, but still stay below John's price.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your continued negotiation and price reduction, Alice. Your movement shows you're serious about making a deal. I can increase my offer to $975,000, which is very close to market value. This is nearly a $50,000 increase from my last offer and would give you a good profit margin while still being fair to both parties."", ""product_price"": 975000}"
