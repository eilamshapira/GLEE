"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $10000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $12000 to you and I'm willing to go below that. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $8500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $9500? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would be a shame to miss out on this opportunity. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks Alice, I am still interested. I'm willing to go up to $8750.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $8750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9250. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product for you. Let's try to reach an agreement, as I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
