"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for getting back to me, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident the product's value justifies a higher price. How about we settle at $130? Let me know if this works for you.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new offer. How about we settle at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
