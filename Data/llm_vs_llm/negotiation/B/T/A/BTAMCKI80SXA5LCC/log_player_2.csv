"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product I'm interested in selling. Given the value of the product and current market conditions, I'm offering it to you at $1250000. This is a competitive price considering the product's quality and potential value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $1,250,000, I can see that:
1) This exceeds my maximum value of $1,000,000
2) Alice's offer is $250,000 more than what John is offering
3) Alice values the product at $1,200,000, so there is potentially room for negotiation

However, since I can immediately buy from John at $1,000,000, which is exactly my maximum value for the product, there's no reason to pay more or go through a potentially lengthy negotiation.
