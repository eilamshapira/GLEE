Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm setting the price at $12,000 because:
1. I know the product is worth $10,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000
3. If Bob rejects at $12,000, I lose nothing as I can sell to John
4. While I know the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, he doesn't know that I know this
5. I can always negotiate down if needed, but it's better to start high"
