"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's offer of $12,000 is higher than my maximum value of $8,000 and higher than John's offer of $8,000, the rational decision would be to buy from John. This way, I'll pay exactly my maximum willingness to pay and save $4,000 compared to Alice's offer.
