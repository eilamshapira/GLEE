"Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to consider my options carefully here.

Alice is offering the product for $25,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum valuation of $12,000. Since the product is only worth $12,000 to me, accepting Alice's offer would mean overpaying by $13,000.

I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, but there's no guarantee she'll lower her price enough to make it worthwhile for me.

The third option is to buy from John for exactly $12,000. While this matches my maximum valuation (meaning I wouldn't save any money), it guarantees I get the product at a price that doesn't exceed its value to me.

Given that Alice's initial offer is more than twice what the product is worth to me, the most rational decision is:
