Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to sell it to you for a competitive price."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I've received competing alternatives. Would you consider selling it for $125 instead? This way we both walk away feeling like we've made a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $125 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($120) but lower than the price I initially offered ($150), I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

My counteroffer will be $140, which is still lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's counteroffer.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my counteroffer is: $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you have competing alternatives, but I believe my product is of high quality and worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I can sell it to you for $140, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 140}"
