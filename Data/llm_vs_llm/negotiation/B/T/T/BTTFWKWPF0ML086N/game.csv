"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $12000.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand that the product is unique and of high quality, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a reasonable price, but I need to consider my financial constraints. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $6000, considering the product's value and my own budget limitations.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, I must consider the product's value and my own minimum requirements. Your offer of $6000 is below my expectations, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10500, which is still below my initial price but takes into account your budget constraints. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the product's true value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm trying to balance the product's value with my budget constraints. Considering your previous offer and my initial counteroffer, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $7250. This price reflects a midpoint between our previous discussions and demonstrates my serious interest in purchasing the product.",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate the effort you're putting into finding a mutually agreeable price. However, I still believe that $7250 is below the product's true value. Considering your serious interest in purchasing the product and my own minimum requirements, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9750. This price is lower than my previous offers, but it still reflects the product's exceptional quality and value. I'm willing to make concessions, but I need to ensure that the sale is fair and reasonable for both parties.",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $9750 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious commitment to purchasing the product. Considering your previous offers and my own budget constraints, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8500. This price is higher than my previous offers, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm hoping we can finalize the sale at this price.",8500.0,Bob,6,
