By offering this price, you ensure that you are not selling the product below your lowest acceptable price. If Bob rejects this offer, you can always sell the product to John for $120. This move puts pressure on Bob to either accept the $120 price or risk losing the product to John."

You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price of $120, it makes the most sense to sell the product to John for $120. This ensures that you get the best price for the product.and you get it now rather than risking Bob not buying it after round 10."
