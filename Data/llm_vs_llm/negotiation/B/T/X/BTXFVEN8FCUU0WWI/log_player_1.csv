Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": $120} 

**Reasoning:** 

I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80). This strategy serves two purposes:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  If Bob values the product highly, he might accept this higher price. 
* **Gather information:** Bob's response (accept or reject) will give me an idea of his perceived value, allowing me to adjust in a potential counter-offer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
