"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $150 to me
2. John is offering the same product for $150
3. Alice's offer of $200 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price

The logical decision is to reject Alice's offer. There's no reason to accept a price of $200 when I can either:
1. Try to negotiate with Alice for a better price
2. Buy from John for $150 if negotiations don't work out

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but leaves room for negotiation. Since I know I can get it for $150 from John, I'll start lower to give room for potential back-and-forth.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is quite high for my budget. I've done some market research, and I know similar products are available for much less. I can offer $120 for the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 120}"
