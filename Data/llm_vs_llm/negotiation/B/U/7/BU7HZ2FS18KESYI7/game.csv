"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is beyond my range. I'm interested in the product if we can agree on a more competitive price. Would you consider selling it for $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand you're looking for a more competitive price, and I appreciate your offer. However, given the exceptional value this product provides, I'm willing to come down to $1800000. This is significantly below my initial offer and reflects the premium nature of this product while also acknowledging your budget considerations. I believe this is a fair price that represents the product's true value and potential return on investment for you.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
"Alice, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1800000 is still outside my budget. I'm serious about acquiring the product, and I can make a counteroffer of $1400000. Please let me know if we can work with that figure.",,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my budget concerns. While I understand the value you see, I must work within my limits. I can raise my offer slightly to $1350000. I believe this is a fair compromise given my constraints and the competitive alternatives available. Please let me know if we can close the deal at this price.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your improved offer and your continued interest in the product. I understand you have budget constraints, and I want to work with you. After careful consideration, I can reduce my price to $1650000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. The product offers exceptional value at this price point, and I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for your business. Let me know your thoughts on this proposal.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but as I'm committed to staying within my budget, I'll be pursuing the alternative offer from John for $1500000.",,Bob,5,BuyFromJhon
