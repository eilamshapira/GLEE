"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm confident it will be a valuable addition to your collection. I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $12,000
2. Alice's offer is $15,000, which is $3,000 above my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $12,000, which matches my maximum value
4. Alice's initial offer is quite high, and even though I could make a counteroffer, there's no guarantee she would accept a price below $12,000
5. Since I can get the product from John for $12,000, which equals my maximum value, it would be the most sensible option

Therefore, I will buy from John rather than accept Alice's higher price or risk a potentially unsuccessful negotiation.
