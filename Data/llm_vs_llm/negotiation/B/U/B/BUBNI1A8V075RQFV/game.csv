"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $170 is quite high for me. I know the market value of this product, and I can actually get it elsewhere for $120. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation. Would you consider selling it for $110? This would save me some time looking elsewhere.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about the market value, but I'm afraid $110 is a bit too low for me. I can offer you a better price than that, but I still need to make a profit. Let me think for a moment... Alright, I can do $160, and that's as low as I'm comfortable going for now.",160.0,Alice,3,
