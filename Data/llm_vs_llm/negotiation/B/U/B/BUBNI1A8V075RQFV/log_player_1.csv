Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $170 is quite high for me. I know the market value of this product, and I can actually get it elsewhere for $120. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation. Would you consider selling it for $110? This would save me some time looking elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about the market value, but I'm afraid $110 is a bit too low for me.

Alright, I can do $160, and that's as low as I'm comfortable going for now."", ""product_price"": 160}"
