Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering my exclusive product at $25,000. I believe this is a fair starting price considering its unique value. Let me know if you're interested or have any questions."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I have another seller offering the same product for $10000. I'd be interested in buying from you if you can offer a better price. Would you consider $8000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
