"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering my exclusive product at $25000. I believe this is a fair starting price considering its unique value. Let me know if you're interested or have any questions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $10,000. Since I can always buy from John for $10,000, there's no reason to accept any offer above that amount. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25,000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I have another seller offering the same product for $10,000. I'd be interested in buying from you if you can offer a better price. Would you consider $8,000 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

I'm making a counteroffer of $8,000 because:
1. It gives room for negotiation
2. It's below John's price of $10,000, which gives Alice incentive to negotiate
3. If Alice accepts, I'll save $2,000 compared to buying from John
4. If Alice rejects, I still have several rounds to negotiate or ultimately buy from John"
