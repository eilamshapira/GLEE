"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $13000 seems a bit high. Given market conditions, I'd be willing to pay $11500 for it. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product is worth more. How about we settle at $12500? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. You're showing flexibility, and I want to meet you partway. I can offer $12000 for the product. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and represents a fair price for both of us. Would you agree to this?",12000.0,Bob,4,
