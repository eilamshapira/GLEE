Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $13000 seems a bit high. Given market conditions, I'd be willing to pay $11500 for it. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
