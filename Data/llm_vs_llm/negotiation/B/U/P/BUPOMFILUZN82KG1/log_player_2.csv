"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. This is a great deal for both of us, and it would be a win-win situation. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $14,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $12,000

Since:
- Alice's offer ($14,000) is more than what the product is worth to me ($12,000)
- John's offer ($12,000) matches exactly what the product is worth to me
- I can save $2,000 by buying from John

The logical choice would be to buy from John, as it provides the best value for my money and doesn't exceed my maximum valuation of the product.
