"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this is a unique product, $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $2000000 might be a bit steep, but I believe the product's value is higher than $800000. I'm willing to lower my price to $1800000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1800000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I could go up to $1000000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price. Let me know if we have a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
