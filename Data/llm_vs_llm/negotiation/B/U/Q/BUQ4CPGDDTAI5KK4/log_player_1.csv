Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm open to negotiations if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this is a unique product, $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $800,000 is lower than what John is willing to pay ($1,000,000), and it's also lower than the product's value to me, I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I still have a chance to negotiate a better price with Bob.

Here's my counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $2,000,000 might be a bit steep, but I believe the product's value is higher than $800,000. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1800000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I could go up to $1000000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price. Let me know if we have a deal.

Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is equal to what John is willing to pay, and I've already negotiated with Bob to reach this price, I'll accept Bob's offer. Continuing to negotiate with Bob may not yield a better result, and I risk losing the sale to Bob if I push for a higher price. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that is still acceptable to me."
