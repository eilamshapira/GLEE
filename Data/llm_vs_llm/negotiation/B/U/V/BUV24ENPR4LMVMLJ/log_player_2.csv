"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to consider the options carefully. 

Alice's offer is $100, which is more than the product is worth to me ($80), and it's also more than what I can buy it for from John ($80). 

Since John is willing to sell the product for $80, which is exactly the maximum I'm willing to pay, there's no reason for me to accept Alice's higher offer of $100.

I could reject and make a counteroffer to Alice, but since John is already offering the product at the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($80), it makes the most sense to just buy from John directly.
