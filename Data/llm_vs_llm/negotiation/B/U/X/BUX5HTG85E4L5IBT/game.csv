"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was looking to spend no more than $8000. Would you be willing to accept this amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8000 is too low for this product's value. While I understand your budget constraints, I need to maintain a certain price point due to the product's quality and market value. I can lower my initial asking price to $13500, which is a significant reduction. Would this work better for you?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $13500 is still beyond what I am willing to spend. I can increase my offer to $9000. How does that sound?",9000.0,Bob,4,
