Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $15,000. This is a competitive price for what you're getting. Would you like to proceed with the purchase?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was looking to spend no more than $8000. Would you be willing to accept this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob since his offer is below my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) and even below John's guaranteed offer. There's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob than John's $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is too low for this product's value. While I understand your budget constraints, I need to maintain a certain price point due to the product's quality and market value. I can lower my initial asking price to $13,500, which is a significant reduction. Would this work better for you?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $13500 is still beyond what I am willing to spend. I can increase my offer to $9000. How does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer is still below John's guaranteed $10,000, and Bob seems unwilling to go much higher based on his small increase from $8,000 to $9,000, it's best to take John's sure offer of $10,000 rather than continue negotiating with Bob."
