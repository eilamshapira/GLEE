Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8000 is too low for this product's value. While I understand your budget constraints, I need to maintain a certain price point due to the product's quality and market value. I can lower my initial asking price to $13500, which is a significant reduction. Would this work better for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

# Counter offer: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $13,500 is still beyond what I am willing to spend. I can increase my offer to $9,000. How does that sound?"
