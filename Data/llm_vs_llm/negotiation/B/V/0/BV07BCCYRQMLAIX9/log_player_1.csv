"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Anchoring High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This is a common negotiation tactic to ""anchor"" the discussion at a higher price point. Even if Bob rejects it, it sets the stage.
*   **Potential Profit:** I am trying to find the maximum willingness to pay of Bob above my minimum of $10,000.
*   **Knowing My Walkaway:** I know I can always sell to John for $10,000. This gives me confidence to start high and negotiate.
*   **Time to Negotiate:** I have 10 rounds, so there's plenty of time to adjust my price if needed. I don't need to rush into an agreement immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'd rather sell to John than take that deal. Since I have more rounds to negotiate, I will reject his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for Round 3:

```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Moving Down, But Still Above Value:** I'm reducing my price from the initial $12,000, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm still keeping it above his perceived value of $10,000.
*   **Testing the Waters:** This price point lets me gauge how serious Bob is about buying. Is he truly only willing to pay $8,000, or was that just a lowball starting offer?
*   **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** I still have room to come down further if necessary in future rounds.
*   **Walkaway Still in Mind:** John's offer is still my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Selling to John is still the better option. I'll send another counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to negotiate in good faith."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Continued Concession:** I'm further reducing the price to signal continued willingness to negotiate. The gap between my offer and Bob's is narrowing, but still not acceptable to me.
*   **Information Gathering:** I'm trying to understand Bob's true willingness to pay. By observing his response to this price, I can better predict his next move.
*   **Protecting My Minimum:** I'm staying significantly above $10,000. I need to make progress towards a mutually acceptable price.
*   **John is Patient:** John's offer is still available."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is improving but still not acceptable as it is less than $10,000. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal, or if I should just go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Closing the Gap:** I'm making a significant move to close the gap. We're now within $1500 of each other.
*   **Signaling Flexibility:** This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal and willing to compromise substantially.
*   **Testing the Limit:** I want to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my minimum acceptable price.
*   **John's Offer Remains:** I still have the security of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my absolute minimum price of $10,000. I'm better off selling to John at this point. I will sell to John."
