"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given the situation, Alice's offer of $12,000 is higher than the product's worth to me ($10,000) and higher than John's alternative offer ($10,000). It doesn't make sense to accept this offer.

Since I can always buy from John for $10,000, and there's potential to negotiate Alice down to a better price, I'll reject the current offer and proceed to making a counteroffer.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $11,500 is still higher than John's price of $10,000. Since I can buy the product from John for $10,000 at any time, and that's the maximum value the product has to me, there's no reason to accept an offer higher than $10,000.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.
