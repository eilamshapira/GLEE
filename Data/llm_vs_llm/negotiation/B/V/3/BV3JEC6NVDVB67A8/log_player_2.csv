"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $250. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $250, which is significantly above my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $100, which matches my maximum value

The logical choice is to reject Alice's expensive offer and buy from John instead.
