"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Looking at the options:

1. Alice is offering the product for $2,500,000
2. I can reject Alice's offer
3. I can buy from John for $1,000,000

Given that the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $1,000,000, Alice's offer of $2,500,000 is significantly higher than both the product's value to me and my alternative option.

The rational choice is to buy from John for $1,000,000.
