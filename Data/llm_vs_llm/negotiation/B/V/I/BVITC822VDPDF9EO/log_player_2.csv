"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Looking at the options provided, I need to make a decision that maximizes my benefit.

Alice is offering the product for $1,800,000, which is significantly above my maximum value of $800,000. If I were to accept this offer, I would be paying $1,000,000 more than the product is worth to me.

John is offering the product for exactly $800,000, which is my maximum value for the product. This is a guaranteed option that ensures I get the product at a price that doesn't exceed my valuation.

Given these considerations:
