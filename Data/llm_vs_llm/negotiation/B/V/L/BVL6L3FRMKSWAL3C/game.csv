"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. Given the exceptional quality and unique value of this product, I must maintain a premium stance. However, I’m willing to adjust the initial offer. How does $1800000 sound? I believe this price better reflects the product's merits while still offering a significant opportunity for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. However, 1800000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 1300000, which I believe is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
