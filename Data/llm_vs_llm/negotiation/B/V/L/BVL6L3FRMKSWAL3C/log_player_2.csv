Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. Given the exceptional quality and unique value of this product, I must maintain a premium stance.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice reduced the price from $2,400,000 to $1,800,000, which is a significant decrease. However, it's still $800,000 above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. I'll try to meet her halfway between my previous offer of $800,000 and her current offer of $1,800,000.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit steep for me.
