"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $150.
2. The product is worth no more than $150 to me.
3. If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy the product from John for $150.

Since Alice's offer is $150, which is the same price John is offering, and also the maximum value the product has to me, there's no advantage to rejecting Alice's offer. Both options would cost me the same amount.
