Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is quite high for this product. I've done my market research, and I believe a more reasonable price would be $1100000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, considering current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
