"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1500000. This is a solid opportunity to acquire it at its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer is exactly the same price as John's ($1,500,000), and it's also the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, there's no advantage in accepting Alice's offer immediately. I should try to negotiate for a better price with Alice, knowing I can always fall back on John's offer if needed.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a significantly lower offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be considered unreasonable.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is quite high for this product. I've done my market research, and I believe a more reasonable price would be $1,100,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, considering current market conditions."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
