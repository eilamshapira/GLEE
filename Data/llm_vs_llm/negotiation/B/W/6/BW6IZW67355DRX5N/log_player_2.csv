"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. If you're interested, please consider my offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since I know the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and John is offering it at exactly $8,000, while Alice's offer is significantly higher at $20,000, the rational decision is to buy from John. This way, I won't overpay for the product and will save $12,000 compared to Alice's offer."
