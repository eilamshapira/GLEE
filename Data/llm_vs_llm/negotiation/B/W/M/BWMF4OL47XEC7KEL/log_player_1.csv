Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's find a middle ground. How about:

{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000}

Considering that the product is valued at no less than $1,000,000 to me, this price seems fair for both parties. However, I'm open to further negotiation if you have a different perspective, Bob."
