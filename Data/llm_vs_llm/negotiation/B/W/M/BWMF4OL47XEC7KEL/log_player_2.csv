"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,500,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000). It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer when I can either try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John at a better price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 900000}

I'll offer $900,000, which is significantly below John's price of $1,200,000. This gives room for negotiation while potentially saving money compared to buying from John. If Alice rejects this offer, we can still negotiate further, or I always have the option to go with John's offer of $1,200,000 as a fallback."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $1,200,000. This price matches John's price, and since we've already tried negotiating for a lower price without success, it's unlikely we'll get a better deal. There's no advantage to buying from John instead since the price is the same, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
