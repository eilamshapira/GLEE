"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $150 is significantly above my budget for this product. I know the product is valuable, but I can actually get the same item from John for $100. I'd like to work with you though, so I'm willing to offer $85 for it. This gives you a quick sale while saving me a bit compared to my alternative option.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than what you're offering. How about we settle at $125? This way, you're still getting a great deal, and I'm getting a fair price for the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $125 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, John is offering the identical product for $100, which is already at the top of my budget for this item. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price than that alternative. I can offer you $90, which gives you a quick sale while still giving me a small savings compared to buying from John.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to work with me. I understand that $125 was still too high, and I'm trying to be flexible. Since you mentioned John's offer of $100, I'm willing to get closer to that price. How about we meet at $110? This way, you're getting a better deal than John's offer, and I'm getting a price that I'm comfortable with.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for coming down on your price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be clear that the product is worth exactly $100 to me, which happens to be John's offering price. For me to purchase from you instead, I'd need a price that's at or below that threshold. My best offer is $95, which would still give you a quick sale while giving me a small incentive to buy from you rather than John.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about the product's value to you. I'm willing to make a small concession to meet you closer to your target price. How about we settle at $98? This way, you're getting an almost identical deal to John's offer, but you're supporting me instead.",98.0,Alice,7,
