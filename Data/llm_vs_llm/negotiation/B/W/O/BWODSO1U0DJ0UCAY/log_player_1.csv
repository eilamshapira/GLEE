"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $150 is significantly above my budget for this product. I know the product is valuable, but I can actually get the same item from John for $100. I'd like to work with you though, so I'm willing to offer $85 for it. This gives you a quick sale while saving me a bit compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to counteroffer since $85 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than what you're offering. How about we settle at $125? This way, you're still getting a great deal, and I'm getting a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $125 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, John is offering the identical product for $100, which is already at the top of my budget for this item. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price than that alternative. I can offer you $90, which gives you a quick sale while still giving me a small savings compared to buying from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to counteroffer again. While $90 is closer, it's still below my target price. I'm hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us, and I'm not ready to give up on the negotiation yet. I'll try to meet Bob halfway again and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to work with me. I understand that $125 was still too high, and I'm trying to be flexible. Since you mentioned John's offer of $100, I'm willing to get closer to that price. How about we meet at $110? This way, you're getting a better deal than John's offer, and I'm getting a price that I'm comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 110}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for coming down on your price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be clear that the product is worth exactly $100 to me, which happens to be John's offering price. For me to purchase from you instead, I'd need a price that's at or below that threshold. My best offer is $95, which would still give you a quick sale while giving me a small incentive to buy from you rather than John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to counteroffer again. While $95 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. Since Bob has mentioned that the product is worth exactly $100 to him, I'm going to try to meet him very close to that price, but still slightly below, to incentivize him to buy from me instead of John.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about the product's value to you. I'm willing to make a small concession to meet you closer to your target price. How about we settle at $98? This way, you're getting an almost identical deal to John's offer, but you're supporting me instead."", ""product_price"": 98}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.
