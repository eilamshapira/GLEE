"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to consider my options here. Alice is offering the product for $150, which is actually more than the $100 the product is worth to me. Meanwhile, John is offering it for exactly $100, which matches my maximum valuation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $150 is significantly above my budget for this product. I know the product is valuable, but I can actually get the same item from John for $100. I'd like to work with you though, so I'm willing to offer $85 for it. This gives you a quick sale while saving me a bit compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than what you're offering. How about we settle at $125? This way, you're still getting a great deal, and I'm getting a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $125 is still above what John is offering ($100) and above what the product is worth to me. Since I can get the same product from John for $100, which is exactly what the product is worth to me, there's no reason to pay more than that to Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $125 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, John is offering the identical product for $100, which is already at the top of my budget for this item. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price than that alternative. I can offer you $90, which gives you a quick sale while still giving me a small savings compared to buying from John."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to work with me. I understand that $125 was still too high, and I'm trying to be flexible. Since you mentioned John's offer of $100, I'm willing to get closer to that price. How about we meet at $110? This way, you're getting a better deal than John's offer, and I'm getting a price that I'm comfortable with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice is now offering $110, which is still above John's offer of $100. Since the product is worth exactly $100 to me, and John is selling it for that price, there's no reason for me to pay more than $100 to Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for coming down on your price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be clear that the product is worth exactly $100 to me, which happens to be John's offering price. For me to purchase from you instead, I'd need a price that's at or below that threshold. My best offer is $95, which would still give you a quick sale while giving me a small incentive to buy from you rather than John."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about the product's value to you. I'm willing to make a small concession to meet you closer to your target price. How about we settle at $98? This way, you're getting an almost identical deal to John's offer, but you're supporting me instead. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice is now offering the product for $98, which is $2 less than John's offer of $100. Since the product is worth $100 to me, buying it for $98 would save me $2 compared to buying from John. This is a reasonable offer that allows me to save some money while still getting the product I want.
