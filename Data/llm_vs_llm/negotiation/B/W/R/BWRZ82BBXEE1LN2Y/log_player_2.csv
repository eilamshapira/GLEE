"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'd like to offer it to you for $120, which I believe is a fair price considering its quality and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

The reason for this decision is that the offered price of $120 exceeds my budget of $100. Since I have the option to buy the same product from John for $100, which is within my budget, I see no reason to accept Alice's higher offer. Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the possibility open for further negotiation or purchasing from John at a price I am willing to pay."
