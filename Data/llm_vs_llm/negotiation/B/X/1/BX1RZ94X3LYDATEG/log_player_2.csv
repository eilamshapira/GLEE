"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 is lower than my maximum budget of $1,200,000, but still higher than what I'd ideally want to pay, I'll choose to reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try and negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's initial offer was $1,000,000 and I want to save as much money as possible, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than her initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I don't know Alice's minimum acceptable price, I'll aim for a midpoint between a very low price and Alice's initial offer.

My counteroffer will be $600,000.

{""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $900,000 is still higher than what I'd ideally want to pay, but it's lower than her initial offer of $1,000,000. Since I rejected her initial offer and made a counteroffer of $600,000, and she rejected that, I can see that she's willing to negotiate.

I'll choose to reject Alice's new offer of $900,000 and make another counteroffer. My goal is to try and get closer to a price that I'm comfortable with, which is ideally below $800,000, considering that's what the product is worth to Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice rejected my previous counteroffer of $600,000 and came back with a new offer of $900,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between my previous offer and her new offer.

My new counteroffer will be $750,000.

{""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $850,000 is getting closer to what I'm willing to pay, but it's still a bit higher than I'd like. Considering that the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I believe she may be willing to go lower.

I'll choose to reject Alice's new offer of $850,000 and make another counteroffer. Since we're getting closer to a mutually acceptable price, I'll make a smaller adjustment this time.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $850,000, and I believe she can go lower, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than the product's value to her, which is $800,000.

My new counteroffer will be $820,000.
