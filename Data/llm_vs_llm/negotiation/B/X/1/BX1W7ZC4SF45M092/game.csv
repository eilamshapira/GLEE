,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $20000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8000. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",8000.0,Bob,2,
"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer, but $8000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $18000 considering your interest in the product. Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to lower my offer to $17000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I hope we can meet in the middle. What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the reduced price, $17000 is still outside my range. I'm sticking to my offer of $8000.  If you're serious about selling, this is where I need to be. ",8000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I see that $8000 is your limit, but I need to maintain the value of the product for my business. I'm willing to come down further to $16000, which is the lowest I can go while still making this worthwhile. Let me know if this works for you.",16000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to ensure the product's value is reflected in the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $15500. This is my final offer before considering other buyers. Let me know if you can work with this price.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $15500 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $8000. It's my final offer, and I'm ready to walk away if it's not acceptable.",8000.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot go below my minimum price. I will have to sell the product to another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $15000. Thank you for your time.",,Alice,6,SellToJhon
