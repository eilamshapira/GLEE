"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Let me make a strategic first offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to him, and I need at least $1,200,000, I'll start high to leave room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

{""product_price"": 1,450,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and even lower than John's guaranteed offer, I will reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still aim for a price that gives me a good profit, considering Bob's potential maximum value of $1,500,000 and my guaranteed alternative of $1,200,000 from John.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price and John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000. Since we're already in round 4 and Bob's offers aren't increasing significantly, I'll take the guaranteed offer from John rather than risk further negotiation rounds that might not reach my target price.
