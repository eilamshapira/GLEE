You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $85 is lower than what I can accept for this product. Given its quality and value, I can offer it to you for $90, which is a fair reduction from my initial price.
