Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. Since I know my minimum acceptable price is $80 (as I can always sell to John for this amount), I should offer Bob a higher price to maximize my potential profit. While I don't know Bob's maximum willingness to pay, a reasonable markup would be to try selling at $120, which is a 50% markup from my minimum price. If Bob rejects this, I still have John's guaranteed offer of $80.
