"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad we can have an open discussion about the price. While I understand that $12000 is within your budget, I have to consider the product's true value and my own costs. I'd like to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your proposal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15500. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I was thinking that $15500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering I can buy a similar product from John for $15000, I'd like to propose a price of $14500. I believe this is a reasonable offer, and I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",14500.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, I must consider the fact that I can sell the product to John for $15000, which is a better offer than your current proposal. That being said, I'd like to make one more attempt to reach a mutually beneficial agreement with you. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14750. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I hope you'll consider it a fair compromise.",14750.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you have other options, but I'm still interested in purchasing the product from you. Considering your latest price of $14750, I'd like to propose a price of $14250. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. If not, I may have to explore other options, including buying from John for $15000.",14250.0,Bob,6,
