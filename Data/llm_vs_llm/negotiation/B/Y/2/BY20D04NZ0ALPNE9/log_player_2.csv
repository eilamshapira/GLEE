"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Accepting Alice's offer gets you the product for $1,100,000.
* This is cheaper than John's offer of $1,200,000.
* While you could try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, there's a risk she'll refuse and you'll end up paying more to John."
