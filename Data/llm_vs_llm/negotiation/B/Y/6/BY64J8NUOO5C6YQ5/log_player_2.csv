"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer ($14,000) is higher than both the maximum I'm willing to pay ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. While I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, I already know that John is willing to sell at $12,000, which matches my maximum price point. There's no guarantee that negotiating with Alice will result in a better price, and since Alice values the product at $12,000, it's unlikely she'll go below that price.
