"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was thinking of a price point that is more aligned with my budget. Given the market conditions and my current financial situation, I'd like to offer $900000 for the product. I believe this price is fair and reflects the product's value while considering my budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget considerations. However, $900000 significantly undervalues the product's potential impact on your business. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $1300000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer and represents a considerable value for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1300000 is still a bit steep for my current budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1000000. This price point feels more manageable for me while still recognizing the value of the product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we are getting closer. I am willing to come down further, recognizing your budgetary limitations. However, I can't go much lower than $1200000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and still allows you to realize a significant return on investment. Consider the long-term value this product will provide.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're indeed getting closer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I need to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to raise my offer to $1100000. This is a significant increase from my previous offers and I believe it represents a fair middle ground for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, your continued interest is encouraging. While I appreciate your increase to $1100000, I'm reaching my limit. I can offer a final price of $1175000. This is the lowest I am willing to go, given the true value of the product. This is a fantastic deal at this price.",1175000.0,Alice,7,
