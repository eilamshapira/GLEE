"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since the offered price of $2,000,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,200,000, it would be illogical to accept this offer. Additionally, buying from John for $1,200,000 is an option but negotiating with Alice might yield a better price. Therefore, the best course of action is to reject Alice's offer and proceed with making a counteroffer in hopes of getting a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that my maximum budget is $1,200,000 and Alice's initial offer was $2,000,000, a reasonable starting point for negotiations would be to offer a price that is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still within my budget. Offering a price too close to my maximum budget might not leave room for further negotiation. Therefore, I'll start by offering a price that is halfway between $0 and my maximum budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,800,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. Since accepting this offer would exceed my budget, option 1 is not viable. Buying from John for $1,200,000 (option 3) remains a viable alternative, but I still have the opportunity to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price within my budget.

Given that Alice has already reduced her price from $2,000,000 to $1,800,000, it indicates a willingness to negotiate. Therefore, I will reject Alice's current offer and proceed to make another counteroffer, hoping to bring the price down further towards my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has reduced her price to $1,800,000, it shows she is willing to negotiate. My previous offer was $600,000, which was significantly lower than her initial offer. Given that she has come down to $1,800,000, I should increase my offer to show willingness to meet in the middle but still aim to stay within my budget of $1,200,000.

A reasonable increase from my previous offer of $600,000, considering Alice's movement, would be to offer a price that is higher but still below my maximum budget. Offering $1,000,000 would be a significant increase from my previous offer, showing that I am serious about purchasing the product, but it also gives room for further negotiation if needed.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her price again, this time to $1,650,000, which indicates she is still willing to negotiate. However, this price is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would mean exceeding my budget, so option 1 is not viable.

Buying from John for $1,200,000 (option 3) is becoming a more attractive option since it's within my budget, and the negotiation with Alice doesn't seem to be reaching a price point that I'm comfortable with.

Given that Alice has come down to $1,650,000, I could try to make another counteroffer. However, since my last offer of $1,000,000 was rejected, and considering that Alice's price reduction is getting smaller ($2,000,000 to $1,800,000 is a $200,000 reduction, and then to $1,650,000 is a $150,000 reduction), it seems like the price might not come down to my budget through negotiation.

At this point, it seems more strategic to either accept that the negotiation might not yield a price within my budget or consider the alternative of buying from John. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible and stay within my budget, and given that Alice's offers are not coming down to my target price, the most logical decision would be to buy from John, as it guarantees a purchase within my budget.
