"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. If you're interested, please consider my offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $100 against my alternatives.

The product is worth no more than $120 to me, and John is willing to sell it to me for $120.

Alice's offer of $100 is $20 less than John's price, which means I would save $20 by accepting Alice's offer. Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is below my maximum value, accepting her offer is the most financially advantageous option.
