"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $2500000. This product is highly valuable, and I'm sure it would be a great asset to you. I'm open to negotiations, so please feel free to make a counteroffer if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's selling the product for $2,500,000, which is significantly above the $1,000,000 it's worth to me. Since John is offering the same product for $1,000,000, which matches the maximum value it has for me, there's no reason to pay Alice's much higher price.

Even if I were to make a counteroffer to Alice, I couldn't possibly negotiate her down from $2.5M to below $1M, which is what John is offering.
