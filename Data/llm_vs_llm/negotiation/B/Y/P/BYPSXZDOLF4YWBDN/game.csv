"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $300 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $50 for it.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $50 is much lower than what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle? I'll offer it to you for $275.",275.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $275 is still too steep for me.  I could consider going up to $75, but that's the highest I can go at the moment.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand. Look, I'm willing to come down further, but I also need to make a reasonable profit. How about we try $250?",250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm seeing some movement, but $250 is still beyond my price range. If you're willing to come down to $100, I'm ready to buy right now. Otherwise, I think I'll have to explore other options.",100.0,Bob,6,
