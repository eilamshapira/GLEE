"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm offering it to you for $300."", ""product_price"": 300}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $300 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $50 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, Bob's offer is too low. I'm not going to sell for $50.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $50 is much lower than what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle? I'll offer it to you for $275."", ""product_price"": 275}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $275 is still too steep for me.  I could consider going up to $75, but that's the highest I can go at the moment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Hmm, $75 is still too low. I need to get closer to $150 to make this worthwhile.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand. Look, I'm willing to come down further, but I also need to make a reasonable profit. How about we try $250?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm seeing some movement, but $250 is still beyond my price range. If you're willing to come down to $100, I'm ready to buy right now. Otherwise, I think I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, Bob is not budging much. $100 is still below my minimum. I'm starting to think this isn't going to work out with Bob. I have 4 rounds left.

Given the risk of further negotiations with Bob yielding an even lower price and running out of time, I'll cut my losses and sell to John.
