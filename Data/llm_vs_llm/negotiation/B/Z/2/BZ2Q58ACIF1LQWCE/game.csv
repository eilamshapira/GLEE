"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Would you be willing to sell at this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I'm afraid $8000 is too low for this product. The quality and value of this product justify a higher price point. The lowest I could go would be $21000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would you consider this price?",21000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $21000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9500, which is a compromise between my initial offer and your current price. Would you consider selling at this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
