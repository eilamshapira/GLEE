"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it at $25,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's quality and value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Would you be willing to sell at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and I believe the product is worth more than that. I'll try to negotiate for a better price with Bob before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I'm afraid $8,000 is too low for this product. The quality and value of this product justify a higher price point. The lowest I could go would be $21,000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would you consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 21000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $21000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9500, which is a compromise between my initial offer and your current price. Would you consider selling at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I choose to sell to John for $15,000. Bob's offers have been consistently well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and his latest increase was relatively small. Given that we're already in round 4 and Bob's offers are still far from my minimum price, it's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John rather than risk further negotiations that may not reach an acceptable price point."
