"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 140}

I understand that Bob might be looking for a better deal, so I'm willing to come down from my initial price. However, I still want to make a significant profit from this sale. Let's see if Bob accepts this new offer. If he doesn't I can always sell to John for $120, which is the lowest I am willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is below the amount I can sell to Jhon. I can always go back to bob with a lower price if I change my mind. So I prefer to sell to John for $120."
