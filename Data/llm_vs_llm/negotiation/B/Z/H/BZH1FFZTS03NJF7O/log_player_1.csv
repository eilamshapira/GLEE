Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what price to offer Bob. Since the product is worth at least $120 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, that's my minimum acceptable price.

I don't know how much Bob values the product, but I should offer a price that gives me a chance to earn more than my guaranteed $120 from John, while still being potentially attractive to Bob.
