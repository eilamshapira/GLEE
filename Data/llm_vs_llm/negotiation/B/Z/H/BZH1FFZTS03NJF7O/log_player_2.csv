"Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer ($175) is higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120), it makes no economic sense to accept her offer. Given that John is willing to sell the product at $120, which matches my maximum value, the best decision is to buy from John.
