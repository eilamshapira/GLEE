"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I certainly understand Bob's perspective, but I believe the product's value is higher than that.

**My counteroffer:**

{""product_price"": 150}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 140}

I've reconsidered and would like to offer Bob the product for $140. This price takes into account both our perspectives, and I believe it's a fair middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I appreciate Bob's efforts to find a suitable price, but given that the product's value to me is no less than $150, I think it's best I sell to John who is willing to buy at the ideal price."
