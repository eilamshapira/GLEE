"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, I believe $15000 is quite high for my budget. Based on my market research, similar products are available for significantly less. I would like to offer $10000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand budget considerations are important, but I need to be transparent that $10000 is below what I can accept for this product. My minimum acceptable price is $12000, which is the current market value. At this price point, you're getting excellent value for the quality offered. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer to $13500 to make this work for both of us. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents good value for this particular product.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price and being transparent about your minimum acceptable price. Since you mentioned $12000 is your minimum and represents the current market value, I would like to offer exactly that - $12000. This price point would work for both of us, as it matches the market value you mentioned and fits within my budget. I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
