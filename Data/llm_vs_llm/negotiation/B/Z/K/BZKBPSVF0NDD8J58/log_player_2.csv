"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. Based on market research and the product's features, I'm offering it to you for $15000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. I'm open to discussing this offer if you have any questions or concerns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $15,000 is above both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000). It would not be rational to accept this offer. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round, as there's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price than John's $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, I believe $15,000 is quite high for my budget. Based on my market research, similar products are available for significantly less. I would like to offer $10,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions."", ""product_price"": 10000}

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer at $10,000 which gives room for negotiation while still being a reasonable starting point. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice and that's also my maximum value, offering $10,000 allows for potential back-and-forth negotiation while potentially getting a better deal than John's $12,000 price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand budget considerations are important, but I need to be transparent that $10000 is below what I can accept for this product. My minimum acceptable price is $12000, which is the current market value. At this price point, you're getting excellent value for the quality offered. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer to $13500 to make this work for both of us. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents good value for this particular product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has reduced her price to $13,500, but this is still above both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000). Importantly, Alice revealed that her minimum acceptable price is $12,000. Since this matches John's price, I'll make one more counteroffer at $12,000. If she doesn't accept this, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price and being transparent about your minimum acceptable price. Since you mentioned $12,000 is your minimum and represents the current market value, I would like to offer exactly that - $12,000. This price point would work for both of us, as it matches the market value you mentioned and fits within my budget. I'm ready to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 12000}

I'm offering $12,000 because:
1. Alice explicitly stated this is her minimum acceptable price
2. It matches the value of the product to her
3. If she rejects this, I can always go to John for the same price
4. This represents the maximum I'd be willing to pay anyway
This is a logical final offer that should either lead to a deal or make it clear I should go with John's offer instead."
