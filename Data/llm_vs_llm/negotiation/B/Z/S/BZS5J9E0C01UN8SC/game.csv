"Hello Alice, thank you for offering this product. While I believe it could be useful, $200 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. How about we settle on $180?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $180 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $100? That feels like a fair compromise.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I can come down a bit further, but $100 is still too low. How about $160? I'm trying to be flexible, but I also need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate that. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $130? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about purchasing.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, and $130 is a more reasonable offer. However, I still need to get a bit more for the product. How about $145? It's a compromise that takes into account your latest offer and my own needs. I'm trying to be as flexible as possible while ensuring I get a fair price.",145.0,Alice,7,
