Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, and $130 is a more reasonable offer. However, I still need to get a bit more for the product. How about $145? It's a compromise that takes into account your latest offer and my own needs. I'm trying to be as flexible as possible while ensuring I get a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $145.  At this point, cutting my losses and buying from John at $120 is the most financially sensible option."
