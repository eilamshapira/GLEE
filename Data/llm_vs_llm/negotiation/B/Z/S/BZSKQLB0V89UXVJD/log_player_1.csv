"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Let me start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

{""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","$5,000 is far too low and below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $15,000, I won't accept any offer below that amount. However, I'll give Bob another chance with a lower counteroffer than my initial one.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll now make a new offer of $20,000, which is a $5,000 reduction from my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's new offer of $6,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and he's only increased his offer by $1,000. Given that he's making such low offers and not showing significant movement toward a reasonable price, I'm going to take the guaranteed offer from John rather than continue negotiations that don't seem promising.
