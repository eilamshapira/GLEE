Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to think strategically about this offer. 

Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000 and I can definitely sell it to John for $1,200,000, there's no reason for me to offer it at a lower price.

At the same time, there's no reason for Bob to pay more than the product's value to him. If I offer a price higher than $1,200,000, Bob would reject it because it would be a loss for him.

Therefore, the optimal offer would be exactly $1,200,000. At this price:
- Bob should be indifferent between accepting and rejecting (since he gets $0 value either way)
- I maximize my earnings
- If Bob rejects, I still get the same amount from John
