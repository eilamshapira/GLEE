"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the details of this product with you. Given its unique features and value, I'm offering it to you for $22000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","The offer of $22,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum budget of $10,000 and John's price of $10,000. There's no reason to accept this offer or even continue negotiating when it's more than double my maximum value. The best decision is to buy from John.
