Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer Bob for the product. Since the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price, I should offer Bob a price higher than $800,000.

Without knowing Bob's valuation, I need to balance between asking for a high price and the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. If I set the price too high, Bob might reject it, and I'll end up with my minimum acceptable amount of $800,000 from John. If I set it reasonably above my minimum, I have a chance to make more profit while still having John as a backup.
