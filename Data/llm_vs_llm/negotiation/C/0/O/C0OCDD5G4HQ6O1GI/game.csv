"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but $1000000 exceeds my budget significantly. I value this product at no more than $800000, which is also the price I can get from another seller. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Could you consider a price of $650000? This would give me a reason to choose your offer over my alternative option.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but selling at $650000 would result in a significant loss for me. I'm willing to lower my price to $900000 to accommodate your budget better. I believe that the value my product offers is worth the additional investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still more than I can justify spending, especially since I can purchase the same product from John for $800000. To make it worth my while to continue our negotiation rather than going with the alternative, I would need a price below $800000. I'm willing to offer $750000, which gives you a better deal than my walking away and buying elsewhere.",750000.0,Bob,4,
