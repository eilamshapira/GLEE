Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but $1000000 exceeds my budget significantly. I value this product at no more than $800000, which is also the price I can get from another seller. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Could you consider a price of $650000? This would give me a reason to choose your offer over my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still more than I can justify spending, especially since I can purchase the same product from John for $800000. To make it worth my while to continue our negotiation rather than going with the alternative, I would need a price below $800000. I'm willing to offer $750000, which gives you a better deal than my walking away and buying elsewhere.
