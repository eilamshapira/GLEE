"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll appreciate the price of $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I see that Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is more than what I value it at ($800,000) and exactly the same as what John is willing to sell it for.

Since Alice's offer exceeds my maximum valuation, and I can get the exact same product from John at my maximum acceptable price, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer.

I value this product at no more than $800,000, which is also the price I can get from another seller. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Could you consider a price of $650,000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but selling at $650000 would result in a significant loss for me. I'm willing to lower my price to $900000 to accommodate your budget better. I believe that the value my product offers is worth the additional investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's new offer of $900,000 is still higher than both my maximum valuation ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000), it doesn't make sense for me to accept. John is offering a better deal at this point.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still more than I can justify spending, especially since I can purchase the same product from John for $800,000. To make it worth my while to continue our negotiation rather than going with the alternative, I would need a price below $800,000. I'm willing to offer $750,000, which gives you a better deal than my walking away and buying elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
