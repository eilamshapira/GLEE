"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $12,000
2. John's price is also $12,000
3. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me

Since Alice's offer ($12,000) is equal to both the maximum I'm willing to pay and John's price, there's no advantage in accepting Alice's offer over buying from John, and vice versa. All options would cost me the same amount.

Note: I chose to accept Alice's offer since it makes no difference financially, and it might be more convenient to complete the transaction with the current seller rather than starting a new transaction with John."
