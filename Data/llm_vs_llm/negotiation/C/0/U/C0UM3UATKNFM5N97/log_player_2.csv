"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. Given its unique value, I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $2,000,000, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower, but still shows that I'm interested in the product. I'll offer $800,000, which is below my maximum budget of $1,200,000.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $800000 is quite below what I'm looking for. How about we meet somewhere in the middle at $1700000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice rejected my previous offer of $800,000 and came back with a counteroffer of $1,700,000, I'll try to find a middle ground that's still within my budget of $1,200,000. I'll offer $1,000,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's current offer, but still below my maximum budget.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,000,000. Is that something you'd be open to?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
