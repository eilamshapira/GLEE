Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm going to try to get closer to my goal with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,550,000. This is still higher than what Bob offered but closer to his initial assessment of the product's value. Hopefully, this will be a good starting point for further negotiation."
