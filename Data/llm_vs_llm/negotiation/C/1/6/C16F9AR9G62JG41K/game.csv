"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I think $95 is a bit high for what I'm looking to spend. I've been comparing similar products and I'd be comfortable buying it at $85. This seems fair considering the market value, and I'm ready to make the purchase right away at this price.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but I think $85 is a bit low for what I'm looking to sell it for. Let's meet in the middle at $90. This way, we both get a fair deal. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,3,
