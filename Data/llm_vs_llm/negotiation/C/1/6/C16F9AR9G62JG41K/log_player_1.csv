Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'd like to offer you my product for $95. It's a great value and I think you'll be very happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I think $95 is a bit high for what I'm looking to spend. I've been comparing similar products and I'd be comfortable buying it at $85. This seems fair considering the market value, and I'm ready to make the purchase right away at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round.
# New offer:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but I think $85 is a bit low for what I'm looking to sell it for. Let's meet in the middle at $90. This way, we both get a fair deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
