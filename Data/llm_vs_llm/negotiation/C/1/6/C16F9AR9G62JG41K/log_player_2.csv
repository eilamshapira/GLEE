"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to offer you my product for $95. It's a great value and I think you'll be very happy with it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to analyze this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering the product for $95, which is lower than John's price of $100. However, the product is worth only $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.

Since I want to save as much money as possible and the product is worth up to $100 to me, I should reject Alice's first offer and make a counteroffer. This gives me a chance to get the product for less than $95.

If negotiations fail, I can always fall back on John's offer at $100, so there's no risk in trying to negotiate a better price with Alice first.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I think $95 is a bit high for what I'm looking to spend. I've been comparing similar products and I'd be comfortable buying it at $85. This seems fair considering the market value, and I'm ready to make the purchase right away at this price."", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but I think $85 is a bit low for what I'm looking to sell it for. Let's meet in the middle at $90. This way, we both get a fair deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has countered with $90, which is $10 less than her initial offer and $10 less than John's price of $100. This is a reasonable middle ground between her initial $95 and my offer of $85.

Given that:
1. The product is worth up to $100 to me
2. Alice's cost is $80 (so she's making a $10 profit at $90)
3. John's price is fixed at $100
4. We've already negotiated down from $95 to $90

This seems like a fair price that gives both of us a good deal. I could try to negotiate further, but $90 represents a good savings from both Alice's initial offer and John's price, while still giving Alice a reasonable profit margin.
