Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. I want to maximize my profit, but I also need to consider the opportunity cost.

I know that:
1. The product is worth at least $8,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer of $8,000 from John
3. Bob's valuation is unknown
4. I only have one chance to make an offer to Bob

Given these conditions, I should offer a price significantly higher than $8,000 since I have nothing to lose - if Bob rejects, I still get $8,000 from John. I'll set a price that could give me a substantial profit while still being potentially acceptable to a buyer who values the product highly.
