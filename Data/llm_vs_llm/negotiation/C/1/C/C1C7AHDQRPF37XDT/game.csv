"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $11500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and benefits.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I believe the product could be a good fit for me at a lower price. I'm willing to buy it for $7000. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $7000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value, and I know it's worth $12000 to you. Let's meet closer to the middle - I can offer it for $10500, which would still give you a good margin.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $10500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8000. This is a fair compromise considering both our needs. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're making progress in our negotiation, but I know this product provides significant value for your needs. Since it's worth $12000 to you, my offer of $9500 would still leave you with a substantial $2500 in value. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9500 is still beyond my budget. I can stretch to $8500, which I believe is a reasonable increase from my last offer and still provides you with a good return. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,6,
