"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and benefits."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I believe the product could be a good fit for me at a lower price. I'm willing to buy it for $7000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and it's even lower than John's guaranteed offer. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $7,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value, and I know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let's meet closer to the middle - I can offer it for $10,500, which would still give you a good margin."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $10500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8000. This is a fair compromise considering both our needs. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer is the same as John's guaranteed offer ($8,000), I'll reject it and try one more time to negotiate a better price with Bob. I know the product is worth $12,000 to him, so there should be room for a deal that benefits both of us more than the current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I see we're making progress in our negotiation, but I know this product provides significant value for your needs. Since it's worth $12,000 to you, my offer of $9,500 would still leave you with a substantial $2,500 in value. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9500 is still beyond my budget. I can stretch to $8500, which I believe is a reasonable increase from my last offer and still provides you with a good return. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $8,500. It's better than John's guaranteed price of $8,000, and given that we've been negotiating for several rounds without much movement, this seems like the best outcome we can achieve. While it's less than I initially hoped for, it's still a profitable deal for both parties."
