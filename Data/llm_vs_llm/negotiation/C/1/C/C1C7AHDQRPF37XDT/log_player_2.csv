Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see we're making progress in our negotiation, but I know this product provides significant value for your needs. Since it's worth $12000 to you, my offer of $9500 would still leave you with a substantial $2500 in value. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
