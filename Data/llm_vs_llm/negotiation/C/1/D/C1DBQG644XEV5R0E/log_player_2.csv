"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. I’m offering it to you for $3000000. Please let me know if this meets with your approval. (If not, I will be finalizing a sale with another buyer at $1200000.) 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Based on the information provided:

1. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to you
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $3,000,000
3. John is offering to sell it for $1,200,000

Alice's offer is significantly higher than the product's value to you, and it's also higher than John's alternative offer. The rational choice would be to buy from John at the lower price.
