"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price point that is significantly lower. I am willing to purchase the product for $4000. What do you think?",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $4000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $11000 is still quite high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $5000. Let's find some middle ground here.",5000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. While $5000 is still too low, I'm willing to come down to $9500. This offer reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"We're making progress, Alice. However, $9500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $6500. Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",6500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to drop my price to $8500, but that's my final offer.  It's a fantastic deal for a product of this caliber.",8500.0,Alice,7,
