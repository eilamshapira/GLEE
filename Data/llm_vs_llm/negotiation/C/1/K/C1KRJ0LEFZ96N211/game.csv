"Hello Bob, I'm selling this product which I value at a minimum of $100. I believe it has great quality and utility. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.  Let me know what you think.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I cannot go as low as $60 as the product is worth at least $100 to me. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $100, but I'd prefer to sell it to you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can come down to $130. Would that work for you?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the explanation. I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I could possibly go up to $75, but that's really the most I can do.  It's a good offer considering John's interest might disappear, and you'd have to start over.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $75, but that's still below what the product is worth to me. I'm not concerned about John's interest disappearing - he has already committed to buying at $100. However, I'd still like to work with you if possible. The lowest I can go is $115, which is still a good value for this product. Let me know if this works for you.",115.0,Alice,5,
