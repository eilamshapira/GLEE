"Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I believe it's worth at least $1200000 to me, and I'm confident it can be even more valuable to the right buyer. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1500000.  Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is significantly below my minimum asking price.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? This allows us both to make a good deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1250000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1100000 is still a bit far off from where I need to be. To show my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
