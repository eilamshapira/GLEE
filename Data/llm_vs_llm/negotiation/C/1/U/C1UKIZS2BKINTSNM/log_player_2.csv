"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $170. It's a great deal for a high-quality item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","The offer of $170 is significantly higher than both John's price ($120) and my maximum value for the product ($120). There's no reason to accept this offer or even continue negotiating when I can get the same product at my maximum acceptable price from John.
