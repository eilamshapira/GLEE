"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since the product is worth $800,000 to me and Alice's offer of $900,000 exceeds that value, it doesn't make sense to accept the offer as it is higher than what the product is worth to me. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $800,000, which aligns with its worth to me. However, before making a final decision, I'd like to try negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of getting a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that the product is worth $800,000 to me and I'm trying to save as much money as possible, my initial counteroffer will be somewhat lower than Alice's initial offer, aiming to start the negotiation process. Since Alice's initial offer was $900,000, I'll start by offering a price that is significantly lower but still leaves room for negotiation.
