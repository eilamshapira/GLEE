"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $17000 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $10000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Could you come down to $9000? This would give me a reason to choose you over my other option.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate you considering me. While $9000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12000.  This would still be a good value for you and allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested.",12000.0,Alice,3,
