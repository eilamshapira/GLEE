"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $17000 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $10000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Could you come down to $9000? This would give me a reason to choose you over my other option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
