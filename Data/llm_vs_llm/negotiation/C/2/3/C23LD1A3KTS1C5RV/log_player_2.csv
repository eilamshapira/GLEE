"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $17000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","The offer from Alice is $17,000, which is higher than the product's worth to me ($10,000) and even higher than John's fixed price of $10,000. Since Alice is asking for much more than I'm willing to pay, and I already have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $10,000, I should reject this offer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $17,000 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $10,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Could you come down to $9,000? This would give me a reason to choose you over my other option."", ""product_price"": 9000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate you considering me. While $9000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12000.  This would still be a good value for you and allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $17,000 to $12,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this price is still higher than John's offer of $10,000, and since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, I would be losing money by accepting Alice's current offer. Given that I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at exactly my maximum value, that's the better choice.
