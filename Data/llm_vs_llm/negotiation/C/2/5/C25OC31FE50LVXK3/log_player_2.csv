"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $10000. This is a great opportunity to get something that's worth much more at a discounted rate. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth up to $12,000 to me (my maximum value)
2. Alice is offering it for $10,000
3. John's fixed price is $12,000

Alice's offer of $10,000 is:
- $2,000 less than my maximum value
- $2,000 less than John's price
- $2,000 more than what it's worth to Alice ($8,000)

Since Alice's offer is below my maximum value and significantly better than John's price, it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer. By accepting, I'll save $2,000 compared to buying from John.
