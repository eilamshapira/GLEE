"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe the product is valuable, but the price of $11500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000, considering the product's market value and my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I cannot accept $9000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value, and I actually have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase it for $10000. That said, I'd prefer to sell it to you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can reduce my initial offer to $11000, which still represents good value considering the product's worth.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for reducing the price to $11000. I understand that you have another buyer willing to pay $10000, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10500, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and the other offer you have on the table.",10500.0,Bob,4,
