Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I cannot accept $9000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value, and I actually have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase it for $10000. That said, I'd prefer to sell it to you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can reduce my initial offer to $11000, which still represents good value considering the product's worth.
