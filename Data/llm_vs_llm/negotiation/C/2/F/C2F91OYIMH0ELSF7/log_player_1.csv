Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $15,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while potentially maximizing my profit.

{""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $5,000 as it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 (John's offer). Since Bob's offer is so low, it suggests he might be trying to anchor the negotiation at a very low price point. Rather than continuing negotiations that might not be productive, I'll take the guaranteed offer from John.
