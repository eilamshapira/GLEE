Send your offer to Bob.,"Considering the situation, I need to make a strategic decision about the price to offer Bob.

Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, he will reject any offer higher than that amount. However, the product is worth at least $150 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay exactly $150.

Given that Bob values the product at less than what it's worth to me, and I have a guaranteed alternative buyer at my minimum acceptable price, the rational decision is to sell to John instead.

I could offer Bob a price of $150, knowing he will reject it, which allows me to then sell to John.
