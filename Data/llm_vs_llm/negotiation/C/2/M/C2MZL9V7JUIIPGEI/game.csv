"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $850000. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for value, my initial offer already represented a $50000 discount from the product's worth to you. I can come down to $920000, which still gives you an $80000 value while allowing me to achieve a reasonable return. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents a good compromise between our positions.",920000.0,Alice,3,
"Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. However, to make this deal work within my constraints, I’d be comfortable moving forward at $900000. I believe this is a fair midpoint between our positions, and I’m hopeful we can agree on this price.",900000.0,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I understand your stance with the $920000 offer, but in order to make this work within my budget, I need to ask if we can settle at $880000. I believe this figure strikes a fair balance between our needs and would allow us to close the deal promptly.",880000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your increased offer of $880000. We're getting closer to an agreement. Looking at the value this product brings to you ($1000000) and considering my bottom line, I can offer $900000. This represents a full $100000 in immediate value for you while still being acceptable on my end. It's a fair middle ground between our last positions, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price point.",900000.0,Alice,5,
