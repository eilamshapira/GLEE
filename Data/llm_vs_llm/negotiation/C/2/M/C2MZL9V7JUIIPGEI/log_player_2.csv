Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $850000. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for value, my initial offer already represented a $50000 discount from the product's worth to you. I can come down to $920000, which still gives you an $80000 value while allowing me to achieve a reasonable return. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents a good compromise between our positions.
