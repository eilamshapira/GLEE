Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","I will reject Bob's offer of $4,000 as it's well below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. Since John is willing to pay $8,000, there's no reason to accept anything lower than that from Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round, lowering my initial price but still maintaining a good margin above $8,000."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer of $6,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, there's no reason to accept a lower price. At this point, given that Bob's offers are still significantly below my minimum, I'll choose to sell to John to secure the guaranteed $8,000.
