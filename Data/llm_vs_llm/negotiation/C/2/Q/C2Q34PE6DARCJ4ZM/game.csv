"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $120 is quite high for my budget. I'm looking to spend no more than $60 for this product based on my research of similar items. Would you be able to meet me at this price point?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is too low considering the product's quality and market value. While I understand your budget constraints, I cannot go below $100 as this product has significant value. Would you consider this more reasonable price?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for considering my offer, Alice. I understand you've come down in price, which I appreciate. However, $100 is still beyond what I can justify spending. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $80, but I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you consider $70? That would be a fair price that works within my budget while still giving you a reasonable return.",70.0,Bob,4,
