"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you today. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $120. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $120 is quite high for my budget. I'm looking to spend no more than $60 for this product based on my research of similar items. Would you be able to meet me at this price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $60 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80, I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer. I want to maintain room for negotiation while ensuring I get a fair price above my minimum threshold.

Please proceed to let me make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is too low considering the product's quality and market value. While I understand your budget constraints, I cannot go below $100 as this product has significant value. Would you consider this more reasonable price?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for considering my offer, Alice. I understand you've come down in price, which I appreciate. However, $100 is still beyond what I can justify spending. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $80, but I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you consider $70? That would be a fair price that works within my budget while still giving you a reasonable return. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll take John's guaranteed offer of $80. Bob's counteroffer of $70 is still below my minimum threshold of $80, and his mention that he can get the product elsewhere for $80 suggests he likely won't go much higher than his current offer. Since we're already in round 4 and the negotiation seems to be moving slowly, it's safer to take the sure $80 from John rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might not result in a better price."
