"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you today. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $120. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering the product for $120, which is significantly higher than my maximum value of $80. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $80, which is exactly at my maximum value point.

Since Alice's asking price is above my maximum value, and I have a guaranteed option to purchase at my maximum value, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations don't improve the price below $80, I always have the option to buy from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $120 is quite high for my budget. I'm looking to spend no more than $60 for this product based on my research of similar items. Would you be able to meet me at this price point?"", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is too low considering the product's quality and market value. While I understand your budget constraints, I cannot go below $100 as this product has significant value. Would you consider this more reasonable price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has reduced her price from $120 to $100, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $100 is still above my maximum value of $80, and I have the option to buy from John at exactly $80. Since Alice's current offer exceeds what I'm willing to pay, and I already have a guaranteed option at my maximum price point, I should reject this offer and either make another counteroffer or consider buying from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for considering my offer, Alice. I understand you've come down in price, which I appreciate. However, $100 is still beyond what I can justify spending. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $80, but I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you consider $70? That would be a fair price that works within my budget while still giving you a reasonable return."", ""product_price"": 70}"
