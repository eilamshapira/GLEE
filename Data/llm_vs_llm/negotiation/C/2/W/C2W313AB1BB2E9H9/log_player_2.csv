"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000, and also much higher than John's alternative offer. It would be better to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations don't progress favorably, I always have the option to buy from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 6000}

I'm offering $6,000, which is below John's price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate upward if necessary while still potentially saving money compared to John's offer. If Alice rejects this and counters with a price still well above $8,000, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $22,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative offer ($8,000). While Alice did reduce the price from $25,000 to $22,000, the reduction is not nearly enough to make it a competitive offer. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round. If Alice continues to make offers well above my maximum value, I can always exercise the option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 6500}

I'm slightly increasing my previous offer to $6,500 to show some willingness to negotiate, but still keeping it well below John's price of $8,000. This gives me room to continue negotiating while potentially saving money compared to John's offer. Given that Alice's previous offers have been very high ($25,000 and $22,000), if she doesn't make a significant move toward a more reasonable price range, I may need to consider taking John's offer soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'm choosing to buy from John because:
1. Alice's offers have only come down marginally ($25k → $22k → $20k) and are still far above my maximum value of $8,000
2. The pace of price reduction suggests we won't reach a reasonable price within the remaining rounds
3. John's offer of $8,000 is at my maximum value and is a guaranteed option
4. We've already used half of our negotiation rounds, and Alice hasn't shown willingness to negotiate in a reasonable price range
5. Further negotiation rounds might not be productive given the large gap between our price expectations

Better to take the sure deal with John rather than continue an unlikely negotiation with Alice."
