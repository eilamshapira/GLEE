"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is equal to my maximum budget, there's a chance I could get a better price. It's worth starting the negotiation to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's opening price. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a good deal. A counteroffer this low might also reveal information about Alice's bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's counteroffer shows she's willing to negotiate. While $12,500 is a more reasonable price, I think there's still room to bring it down closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to move, but I'm still aiming for a price significantly lower than her current offer."
