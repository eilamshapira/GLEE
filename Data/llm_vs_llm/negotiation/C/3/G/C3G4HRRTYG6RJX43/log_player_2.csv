"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","The initial offer of $250 is significantly higher than my maximum willingness to pay of $150. Buying from John is a viable option at $150. However, since I have 10 rounds of negotiation, I should try to negotiate with Alice first to potentially get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I will start with a low counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. A price significantly below my maximum will allow room for negotiation in subsequent rounds.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's offer of $200 is still too high. Buying from John for $150 remains a better option. I will reject her offer and try a counteroffer closer to my target price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice is moving down, but still far from my target. I will increase my offer significantly to show I am serious and hopefully encourage her to come down further.
