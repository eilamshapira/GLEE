"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is far above what I can afford for this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $7000 for the product. This is a fair price considering current market conditions.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I cannot accept $7000. This product is worth significantly more to me - my minimum acceptable price is $15000, which is actually the same price another buyer (John) is already willing to pay. However, I'd like to give you the opportunity to purchase it. I can come down to $17500, which is still a fair price considering the product's quality and value.",17500.0,Alice,3,
