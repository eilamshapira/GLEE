Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I am willing to sell it to you for $20,000. This is a quality product with excellent features that should serve your needs well."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is far above what I can afford for this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $7000 for the product. This is a fair price considering current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I cannot accept $7,000. This product is worth significantly more to me - my minimum acceptable price is $15,000, which is actually the same price another buyer (John) is already willing to pay. However, I'd like to give you the opportunity to purchase it. I can come down to $17,500, which is still a fair price considering the product's quality and value."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
