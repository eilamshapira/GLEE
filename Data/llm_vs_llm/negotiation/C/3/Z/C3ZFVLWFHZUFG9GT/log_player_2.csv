"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I am willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a quality product with excellent features that should serve your needs well. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000, and it's also much higher than John's alternative offer. It would be better to reject this offer and make a counteroffer, or if negotiations don't progress well, I can always buy from John at $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20,000 is far above what I can afford for this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $7,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering current market conditions."", ""product_price"": 7000}

I'm offering $7,000 which is slightly below John's price of $8,000, giving me room to negotiate upward if necessary while still maintaining the option to go with John's offer if Alice doesn't come down significantly from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I cannot accept $7000. This product is worth significantly more to me - my minimum acceptable price is $15000, which is actually the same price another buyer (John) is already willing to pay. However, I'd like to give you the opportunity to purchase it. I can come down to $17500, which is still a fair price considering the product's quality and value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John because:
1. Alice has revealed that her minimum price is $15,000, which is still far above my maximum value of $8,000
2. Her current offer of $17,500 is more than double my maximum value
3. Alice seems unlikely to come down to a price near my range, given her stated minimum
4. John's offer of $8,000 is right at my maximum value, and while it's not ideal, it's a guaranteed option that meets my needs
5. Continuing negotiations with Alice would likely be futile given the large gap between her minimum ($15,000) and my maximum ($8,000)

Therefore, it's best to end the negotiation and take John's offer rather than waste more time on negotiations that are unlikely to succeed."
