"Hi Bob, I have an excellent product that I'd like to offer you. I believe it would be a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. Let me know if this works for you.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. I know I can get this same product elsewhere for $120. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $90 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without having to find another buyer. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your point, but $90 is below my cost. How about we meet in the middle at $150? I believe this price reflects the value I'm offering and ensures a fair transaction for both of us. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on your price. However, $150 is still more than I can pay, especially when I know I can get the same product for $120 elsewhere. To save us both time in this negotiation, I'll be direct - I can offer $110, which is less than my alternative option but would give you a sale today. This is a fair price that works within my budget while still giving you a reasonable deal. Can we make this work?",110.0,Bob,4,
