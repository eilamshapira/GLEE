Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have an excellent product that I'd like to offer you. I believe it would be a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. I know I can get this same product elsewhere for $120. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $90 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without having to find another buyer. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your point, but $90 is below my cost. How about we meet in the middle at $150?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on your price. However, $150 is still more than I can pay, especially when I know I can get the same product for $120 elsewhere. To save us both time in this negotiation, I'll be direct - I can offer $110, which is less than my alternative option but would give you a sale today. This is a fair price that works within my budget while still giving you a reasonable deal. Can we make this work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.
