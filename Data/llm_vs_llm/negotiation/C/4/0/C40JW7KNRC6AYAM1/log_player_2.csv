"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an excellent product that I'd like to offer you. I believe it would be a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's offer of $200 is way above the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($120), and it's also higher than John's guaranteed price of $120. Since I can get the exact same product from John for $120, I should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price from her, knowing I always have John's offer as a backup.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. I know I can get this same product elsewhere for $120. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $90 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without having to find another buyer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your point, but $90 is below my cost. How about we meet in the middle at $150? I believe this price reflects the value I'm offering and ensures a fair transaction for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $150 is still above John's guaranteed price of $120, so it doesn't make sense for me to accept it. I should continue negotiating since I can still get the product from John at any time for $120.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on your price. However, $150 is still more than I can pay, especially when I know I can get the same product for $120 elsewhere. To save us both time in this negotiation, I'll be direct - I can offer $110, which is less than my alternative option but would give you a sale today. This is a fair price that works within my budget while still giving you a reasonable deal. Can we make this work?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
