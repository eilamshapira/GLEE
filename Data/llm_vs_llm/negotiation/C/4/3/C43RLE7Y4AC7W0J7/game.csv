"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $15000 is well above my budget. I've actually found the same product available elsewhere for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I can offer you $8500 for the product. This would save me some money compared to my alternative option and hopefully still provide you with a fair deal. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $8500 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $12000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
