Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $15000 is well above my budget. I've actually found the same product available elsewhere for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I can offer you $8500 for the product. This would save me some money compared to my alternative option and hopefully still provide you with a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $8,500 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
