"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a price that I think reflects its value.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $200 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $100 is lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still believe the product's value is higher. Let's try to find a middle ground. I can offer it to you for $180, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $180 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to go up to $150. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your latest offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price to $150. It shows we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still believe the product's value is a bit higher. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to make a small concession. I can sell it to you for $160, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. Let me know if this works for you.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While I understand your value for the product, $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $155. This is my final offer, let me know if it works for you.",155.0,Bob,6,
