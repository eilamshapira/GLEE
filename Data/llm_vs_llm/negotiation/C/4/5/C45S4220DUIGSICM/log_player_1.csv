Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a price that I think reflects its value."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $200 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price. Since Bob's offer is $100 and I know I can sell it to John for $120, I'll try to meet Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer, but still above the price John is willing to pay. 

My counteroffer to Bob: $180"

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still believe the product's value is higher. Let's try to find a middle ground. I can offer it to you for $180, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $180 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to go up to $150. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since Bob is willing to pay $150, which is closer to my target but still not ideal, I'll try to meet him closer to the middle of his new offer and my previous counteroffer, but ensure it's above the $120 I can get from John.

My counteroffer to Bob: $160"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your latest offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price to $150. It shows we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still believe the product's value is a bit higher. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to make a small concession. I can sell it to you for $160, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While I understand your value for the product, $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $155. This is my final offer, let me know if it works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Bob's final offer of $155 is very close to my last counteroffer of $160, and it's significantly higher than the $120 I can get from John. Given that Bob has stated this is his final offer, I believe accepting it is the best choice to ensure the sale goes through. It's a good compromise, and I'm earning a premium over the minimum I'm willing to accept."
