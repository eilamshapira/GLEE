Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $100 is lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still believe the product's value is higher. Let's try to find a middle ground. I can offer it to you for $180, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.
