"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Based on the current offer from Alice at $10,000, I should analyze my options carefully:

1. Alice is offering the product for $10,000, which is $2,000 less than the maximum I'm willing to pay ($12,000)
2. The offer from John is fixed at $12,000, which would cost me $2,000 more than Alice's current offer
3. I could reject and make a counteroffer, but I risk Alice increasing her price if negotiations continue poorly

Since Alice's offer of $10,000 is already below my maximum value and provides me with $2,000 in savings compared to John's price, accepting this offer is the rational choice.
