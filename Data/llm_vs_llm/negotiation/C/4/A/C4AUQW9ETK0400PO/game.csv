"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair offer.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $200 is quite above my budget range. I am very interested in the product and would like to propose a counteroffer of $50. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be out of your budget, but $50 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and find a middle ground. Let's try to meet in the middle.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $70? I think it's a fair price that reflects both of our interests.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $70. However, I still need to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to come down a bit more from my previous offer, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's try $140.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice. I'm trying to make this work for both of us. How about $75? I believe it's closer to what might work for both of us while giving you a slight premium over my alternative option.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to negotiate. However, I need to emphasize that $75 is still a long way from what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need you to meet me closer to my target price. Let's try $130. If we can't agree on a price soon, I may need to explore other options.",130.0,Alice,7,
