"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $200 is quite above my budget range. I am very interested in the product and would like to propose a counteroffer of $50. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $50 because it's significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $120. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to find a price that is closer to the product's true worth. I'll proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be out of your budget, but $50 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and find a middle ground. Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 150}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $70? I think it's a fair price that reflects both of our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $70 because it's still below the minimum value I have for the product, which is $120. While Bob is increasing his offer, it's not enough to convince me to sell at a loss. I'll proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a price that is closer to the product's true worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $70. However, I still need to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to come down a bit more from my previous offer, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's try $140."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. I'm trying to make this work for both of us. How about $75? I believe it's closer to what might work for both of us while giving you a slight premium over my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $75 because it's still significantly below the minimum value I have for the product, which is $120. Although Bob is trying to negotiate in good faith, his offers are not getting close enough to my target price. I'll proceed to the next round, but I'm starting to consider selling to John for $120 as a more viable option if Bob's next offer doesn't show more substantial movement."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to negotiate. However, I need to emphasize that $75 is still a long way from what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need you to meet me closer to my target price. Let's try $130. If we can't agree on a price soon, I may need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 130}"
