"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at $120, which I think is a fair price considering its features and quality. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $120
3. John is offering the same product for $100
4. My goal is to buy the product while saving money

Since:
- Alice's price ($120) is higher than my maximum valuation ($100)
- John's price ($100) matches my maximum valuation
- I want to save money

The logical choice would be to buy from John, as it would save me $20 compared to Alice's offer and matches my maximum valuation.
