Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price to offer Bob.

Bob values the product at $120, so he won't pay more than that.
My minimum acceptable price is $80.
If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed $80 from John.
To maximize my profit while giving Bob some incentive to accept, I should offer a price below $120 but well above $80.

I'll offer $110, which:
- Gives me a good profit ($30 above my minimum)
- Gives Bob some surplus value ($10 below his maximum)
- Is high enough that even if rejected, I only lose $30 compared to accepting John's $80
