"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll analyze this situation.

Alice is offering the product for $950,000, while John's price is fixed at $1,200,000.

Since Alice's price ($950,000) is significantly lower than both John's price ($1,200,000) and my maximum valuation ($1,200,000), it's clearly the best option. I would save $250,000 compared to buying from John.
