Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. I'm selling it for $120. This is a fair price given the product's value and quality. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. How about $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","I'm going to consider my options here:

1. Accept Bob's offer of $100 - This is $20 more than my minimum acceptable price ($80) and would give me a good profit.
2. Reject and counteroffer - I could try to negotiate a bit more, but there's a risk of losing the deal.
3. Sell to John for $80 - This is my guaranteed backup option but would earn me less than Bob's current offer.

Since Bob's offer of $100 is already above my minimum threshold and represents a good profit, I'll accept it.
