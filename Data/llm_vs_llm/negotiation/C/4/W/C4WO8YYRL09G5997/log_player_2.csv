"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'll analyze this situation:

- The product is worth no more than $100 to me (Bob)
- Alice is selling a product that costs her $80
- Alice offered to sell it for $90
- I can buy from John for $100 as a fallback option

Alice's offer of $90 is $10 less than John's price of $100, so it's already saving me money compared to my alternative. However, since there are 10 rounds of negotiation available, I should try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that splits the difference between Alice's cost ($80) and her initial offer ($90).

{""product_price"": $85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'll analyze the updated situation:

- Alice has lowered her price from $90 to $88
- This is still $12 less than John's price of $100
- We've only used 3 of our 10 available negotiation rounds
- Alice moved down $2 from her initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate
- There's potential to get an even better price

Since we have plenty of rounds left and Alice is showing flexibility, I'll continue negotiating to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down $2 from her initial offer, I'll move up $1 from my initial counteroffer to show good faith in the negotiation while still trying to get a good deal.

{""product_price"": $86}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'll analyze the updated situation:

- Alice has now lowered her price to $87
- She's moved down $3 from her initial $90 offer
- I moved up $1 from my initial $85 counteroffer
- We're converging towards a middle ground
- $87 is still $13 less than John's price of $100
- We've only used 5 of our 10 available negotiation rounds

Alice is still showing willingness to negotiate, but her decreases are getting smaller ($2, then $1). We're getting closer to a final price. Since we still have 5 rounds left and Alice has continued to lower her price, I'll continue negotiating once more.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since we're getting closer to an agreement and Alice has moved down to $87, I'll increase my offer by $0.50 to show continued good faith while trying to meet in the middle.

{""product_price"": $86.50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $86.9. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $86.9
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'll analyze the updated situation:

- Alice has now lowered her price to $86.90
- She's moved down $3.10 from her initial $90 offer
- The gap between our offers is now only $0.40 ($86.90 vs. $86.50)
- We've used 7 of our 10 available negotiation rounds
- $86.90 is $13.10 less than John's price of $100

Alice has continued to move closer to my offer, and we're now only $0.40 apart. This indicates we're very close to reaching an agreement. Given that we're so close and the difference is minimal, I'll accept this offer rather than risk further negotiation for a very small potential gain.
