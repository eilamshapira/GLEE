"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $15000 is the absolute maximum I could pay, and I can actually get it from another seller at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Given the market value, I'd like to offer $11500 for the product. This gives you a good profit margin while allowing me some savings compared to my alternative option. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, I believe the product's value justifies a bit more than $11500. Let's see if we can meet somewhere closer to my valuation. Looking forward to your thoughts.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your position. Given the unmatched quality and value of this product, I'm prepared to adjust further. How does $13000 sound? I believe this price strikes a fair balance between the value you receive and the unique benefits of choosing my product. Let me know your thoughts.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I can see we're making progress, but I'm still looking for a better value. I can offer $12000, which gives you a solid $2000 profit on your $10000 investment while still giving me some savings compared to the alternative. This seems like a fair middle ground between your $13000 and my previous offer. What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your efforts to find a fair middle ground. I'm happy to accept your offer of $12000. Let's proceed with the sale.",,Alice,4,AcceptOffer
