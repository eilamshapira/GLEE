Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $15000 is the absolute maximum I could pay, and I can actually get it from another seller at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Given the market value, I'd like to offer $11500 for the product. This gives you a good profit margin while allowing me some savings compared to my alternative option. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
