"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in this unique product. Based on its exceptional quality and the value it brings, I’m offering it at $15000. Looking forward to hearing from you if you’d like to move forward! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to make a strategic decision here. Alice is offering the product at $15,000, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay and the same price that John is offering. Since the product is only worth $10,000 to Alice, there should be room for negotiation.

While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is the absolute maximum I could pay, and I can actually get it from another seller at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Given the market value, I'd like to offer $11,500 for the product. This gives you a good profit margin while allowing me some savings compared to my alternative option.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your position. Given the unmatched quality and value of this product, I'm prepared to adjust further. How does $13000 sound? I believe this price strikes a fair balance between the value you receive and the unique benefits of choosing my product. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down from $15,000 to $13,000, which is a significant reduction and shows willingness to negotiate. This is already better than John's fixed price of $15,000. However, since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, there might still be room to negotiate a better price.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I can see we're making progress, but I'm still looking for a better value. I can offer $12,000, which gives you a solid $2,000 profit on your $10,000 investment while still giving me some savings compared to the alternative. This seems like a fair middle ground between your $13,000 and my previous offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
