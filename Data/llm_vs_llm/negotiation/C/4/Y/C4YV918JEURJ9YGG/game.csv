"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to propose a lower price.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I understand that $90 was too low, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a price of $100, which I think is a reasonable compromise.",100.0,Bob,4,
