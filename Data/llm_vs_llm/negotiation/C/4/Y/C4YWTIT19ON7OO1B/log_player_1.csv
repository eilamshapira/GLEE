Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $120. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product. Would you be able to match this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let me explain my reasoning: Bob's offer of $60 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $100. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $100, I won't accept anything lower than that. However, I'll try one more negotiation round with Bob before selling to John, as there might be a chance to get a better price than $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is too low for this product. Given that I have another buyer willing to pay significantly more, the lowest I can go is $110. This is already a reduction from my initial offer, considering the product's quality and value."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. However, $110 is still too high for me. I can offer $70 for the product. How about that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Let me explain my reasoning: Bob's latest offer of $70 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $100. Given that the product is only worth $80 to Bob (as stated in the initial conditions), it's unlikely that he will ever offer more than $80. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $100, and it's clear that Bob won't match or exceed this price, the most rational decision is to sell to John now rather than continue negotiating."
