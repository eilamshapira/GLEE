"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I'm afraid $1000000 is significantly above my budget. I've been researching the market, and I know I can get this same product elsewhere for $800000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $650000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale while allowing me to stay within my budget constraints. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your offer of $650000. However, I believe the value of the product is higher. How about we settle on a price of $850000? I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth. Let me know what you think!",850000.0,Alice,3,
