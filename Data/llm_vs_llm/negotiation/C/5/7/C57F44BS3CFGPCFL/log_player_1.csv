Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I'm afraid $1000000 is significantly above my budget. I've been researching the market, and I know I can get this same product elsewhere for $800000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $650000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale while allowing me to stay within my budget constraints. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
