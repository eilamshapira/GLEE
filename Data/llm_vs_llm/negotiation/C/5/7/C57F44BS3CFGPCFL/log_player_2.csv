"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you an incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given Alice's offer of $1,000,000, I should carefully consider my options:

1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. John is willing to sell the identical product for $800,000
3. Alice's current offer is $1,000,000, which is $200,000 more than my maximum valuation

Since Alice's offer exceeds both my maximum valuation and John's alternative price, the rational choice is to either reject and make a counteroffer or buy from John directly.

I'll reject Alice's offer so I can make a counteroffer. This gives me a chance to potentially get the product for less than $800,000, while still having John's offer as a fallback.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I've been researching the market, and I know I can get this same product elsewhere for $800,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale while allowing me to stay within my budget constraints. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 650000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your offer of $650000. However, I believe the value of the product is higher. How about we settle on a price of $850000? I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Looking at Alice's new offer of $850,000, I need to evaluate my options:

1. Alice is now offering the product for $850,000
2. John is willing to sell the identical product for $800,000
3. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me

Since John's offer is $50,000 less than Alice's current offer, and John's price matches my maximum valuation, the rational choice is to buy from John. There's no reason to pay more than $800,000 when I can get the exact same product at that price.
