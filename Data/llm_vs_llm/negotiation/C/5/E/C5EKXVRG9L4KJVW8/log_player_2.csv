"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2000000. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm open to negotiations if you have a different valuation in mind. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to make a decision based on the information provided. Alice is offering the product for $2,000,000, but I know that the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me. John is willing to sell me the same product for $1,500,000.

Since Alice's offer exceeds the maximum value I place on the product, and it's also higher than John's guaranteed price, it doesn't make sense to accept Alice's current offer. I could try to negotiate with Alice, but given that I already have a guaranteed option at my maximum valuation, the sensible choice is to buy from John.
