"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional quality and the value it can bring to you, I'm confident that it's worth $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Based on the information provided, I should evaluate whether Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is reasonable given my constraint that the product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me.

Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is $200,000 less than John's price and below my maximum valuation. This is a good offer that would save me money compared to buying from John.
