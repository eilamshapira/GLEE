"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $170 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $100. Would that work for you?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low considering the product's value. I can offer it to you for $155, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a very competitive offer for this product's quality. Would this work for you?",155.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I'm still a little ways off at $155.  I could go up to $110.  That's the highest I can go.",110.0,Bob,4,
