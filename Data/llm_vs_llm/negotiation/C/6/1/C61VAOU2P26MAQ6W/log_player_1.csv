Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $170. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $170 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $100. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $100 since it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150, but I'll make a counteroffer to try to reach a deal before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low considering the product's value. I can offer it to you for $155, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a very competitive offer for this product's quality. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 155}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I'm still a little ways off at $155.  I could go up to $110.  That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $150. Bob's maximum offer of $110 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and since John is willing to pay $150, that's the better option for me."
