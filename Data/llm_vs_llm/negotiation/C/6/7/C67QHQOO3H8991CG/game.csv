"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $300 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $50 for it.  What do you think?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. $50 is much too low, as the product is worth at least $100 to me. How about we meet in the middle? I'll come down to $250.",250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $250 is still out of my price range. I can go up to $60, but that's really the most I can do.",60.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly worth more. I'm willing to go down to $200, but that's as low as I can reasonably go. This is a significant drop from my initial offer.",200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, the gap between what I'm willing to pay and your offer is still too large.  My absolute maximum is $70. If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",70.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we are getting closer. I really can't go much lower. How about $150? That's a significant decrease on my end. I think you'll find that's a very fair price.",150.0,Alice,7,
