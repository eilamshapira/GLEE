You have three options:

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly worth more. I'm willing to go down to $200, but that's as low as I can reasonably go. This is a significant drop from my initial offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to come down to a price I'm willing to pay. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed option."
