"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,499,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,499,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Alice's offer: $1,499,999
2. John's price: $1,500,000
3. My maximum value: $1,500,000

Alice's offer is just $1 less than John's price, and equal to my maximum value. While it saves me $1 compared to buying from John, it's still at the very upper limit of what the product is worth to me. However, since it does save me $1, and I need to buy the product anyway, I should accept Alice's offer as it's marginally better than buying from John.
