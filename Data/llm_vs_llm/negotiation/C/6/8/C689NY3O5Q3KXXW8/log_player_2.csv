"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to consider Alice's offer of $11,900 compared to my alternatives.

The product is worth up to $12,000 to me, and my alternative is buying from John for $12,000.

Alice's offer at $11,900 saves me $100 compared to buying from John. While it's not a huge discount, it's still better than paying the full $12,000.
