Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in doing business with me. However, I find your asking price of $3000000 to be significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. The product is worth no more than $1200000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for that price. I would like to do business with you instead, so I'm offering $800000 for the product. This would be a win for both of us as you make the sale and I save compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about the alternative option, but I must inform you that I have the option to sell the product to another buyer, John, for $1500000. I am willing to meet you halfway at $2250000. This way, we both benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 2250000}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, considering your alternatives and my own, I've reevaluated my offer. I'm now willing to sell the product for $2,000,000. This price reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer and provides you with a better deal than your alternative option, John, while still being fair to me."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $2000000 is still substantially higher than what makes financial sense for me. As I mentioned, I can purchase this product from John for $1200000, which is the maximum value this product has to me. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I need a better price. I'm willing to offer you $950000. This gives you a sale while allowing me to save compared to my alternative option. If we can't find a middle ground below John's price, I'll unfortunately need to go with his offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I've given this a lot of thought, and I'm willing to make another concession to reach an agreement. I'm now offering the product for $1,600,000. This price is quite close to what John is offering you, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us. However, this is my final offer. If you cannot accept this price, I will have to consider selling to John."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for continuing to work with me on this deal. However, your offer of $1600000 still doesn't make economic sense for me. As I've mentioned, I can purchase this product from John for $1200000, which represents the maximum value this product has to me. There's no incentive for me to pay more than that amount. In fact, to make it worthwhile to purchase from you rather than John, I would need to save money. My offer is $1100000 - this is actually higher than my previous offer and gives you a sale while still providing me with some savings compared to John's price. This is the most I can offer while still making this deal beneficial for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""message"":""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, your offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than what I can get with certainty from John. I've decided to proceed with selling the product to John for $1,500,000. I hope we can work together on future opportunities.""}"
