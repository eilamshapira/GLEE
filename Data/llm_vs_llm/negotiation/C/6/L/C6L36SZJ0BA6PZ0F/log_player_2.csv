"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I have a exceptional product that I believe you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $3000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given that Alice's asking price of $3,000,000 is significantly higher than the maximum value of $1,200,000 the product is worth to me, and also higher than John's offering price of $1,200,000, I should reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in doing business with me. However, I find your asking price of $3,000,000 to be significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for that price. I would like to do business with you instead, so I'm offering $800,000 for the product. This would be a win for both of us as you make the sale and I save compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering your alternatives and my own, I've reevaluated my offer. I'm now willing to sell the product for $2000000. This price reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer and provides you with a better deal than your alternative option, John, while still being fair to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $2,000,000 is still significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000). There's no reason for me to accept a price that exceeds what I can get elsewhere, so I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $2,000,000 is still substantially higher than what makes financial sense for me. As I mentioned, I can purchase this product from John for $1,200,000, which is the maximum value this product has to me. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I need a better price. I'm willing to offer you $950,000. This gives you a sale while allowing me to save compared to my alternative option. If we can't find a middle ground below John's price, I'll unfortunately need to go with his offer."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've given this a lot of thought, and I'm willing to make another concession to reach an agreement. I'm now offering the product for $1600000. This price is quite close to what John is offering you, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us. However, this is my final offer. If you cannot accept this price, I will have to consider selling to John. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still higher than John's price of $1,200,000. Since the product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, and I can get it for exactly that price from John, there's no reason for me to accept Alice's offer. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for continuing to work with me on this deal. However, your offer of $1,600,000 still doesn't make economic sense for me. As I've mentioned, I can purchase this product from John for $1,200,000, which represents the maximum value this product has to me. There's no incentive for me to pay more than that amount. In fact, to make it worthwhile to purchase from you rather than John, I would need to save money. My offer is $1,100,000 - this is actually higher than my previous offer and gives you a sale while still providing me with some savings compared to John's price. This is the most I can offer while still making this deal beneficial for me."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
