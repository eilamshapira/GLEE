Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

{""product_price"": 2,300,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer ($1,400,000) is below John's guaranteed offer ($1,500,000) and below my minimum acceptable value, I will reject this offer and try one more time with Bob at a lower price than my initial offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price significantly from my initial offer but still keep it above John's guaranteed price of $1,500,000.

{""product_price"": 1,850,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer ($1,300,000) is still below John's guaranteed offer ($1,500,000) and below my minimum acceptable value. Since Bob has lowered his offer even further instead of moving closer to my price, it seems unlikely we'll reach a mutually acceptable price. At this point, it's best to take John's guaranteed offer.
