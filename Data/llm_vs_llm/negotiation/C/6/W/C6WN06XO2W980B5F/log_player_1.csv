Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $15000 is significantly above my budget. Based on my research and the product's features, I value it at no more than $5500. I'd be willing to purchase it at this price. For transparency, I should mention that I have another option to buy this product elsewhere for $8000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your transparency. How about we meet in the middle?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $12000 is still considerably above what I can justify spending on this product. My research shows comparable products in the market, and I have a firm offer from another seller at $8000. To continue our negotiation, I can offer $6500, which I believe is fair given the market conditions. I'd really prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us, but I do need to be mindful of my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for continuing to work with me on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to reduce your offer to $9500. However, I need to be transparent that I have a firm offer of $8000 from another seller for the identical product. Given that, I can offer you $7500, which is actually better for me than taking the other offer. This represents the premium I'm willing to pay to purchase from you specifically. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $8000, I'll unfortunately need to go with the other option as that's the maximum value this product represents to me based on my needs and budget.
