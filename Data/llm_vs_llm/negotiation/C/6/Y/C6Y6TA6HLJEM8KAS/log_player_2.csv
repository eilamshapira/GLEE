"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something you've been looking for, and it's in great condition. I'm offering it to you for $85.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth $80 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $85
3. John is willing to sell it for $80
4. If I buy from Alice, I'll be paying $5 more than what the product is worth to me
5. If I buy from John, I'll be paying exactly what the product is worth to me

Since Alice's offer ($85) is above my maximum valuation ($80), and John is offering the product at exactly $80, the rational decision would be to buy from John.
