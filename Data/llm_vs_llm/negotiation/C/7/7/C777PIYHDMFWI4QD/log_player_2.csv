"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is $200,000 more than my maximum value of $800,000. If I were to accept this offer, I would be paying more than the product is worth to me. Meanwhile, John is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $800,000.

Since this is only round 1 of 10 possible rounds, I should try negotiating with Alice first before resorting to buying from John. The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's room for her to lower her price.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $650,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has lowered her offer to $900,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still $100,000 more than what the product is worth to me and what I can pay John for the same product. Since we still have 7 more potential rounds of negotiation, I'll continue trying to get a better price from Alice.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has now lowered her offer to $850,000, which is getting closer to my maximum value but still $50,000 more than what John is offering. I see that Alice is gradually coming down in price ($1,000,000 → $900,000 → $850,000), so there's a good chance she might accept a price at or below $800,000 in future rounds.

Since we still have 5 more potential rounds and Alice is showing flexibility, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $750,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice is now offering $825,000, which is getting closer but still $25,000 more than John's offer of $800,000. Alice's price reductions are getting smaller ($50,000 reduction from $900,000 to $850,000, but only $25,000 reduction from $850,000 to $825,000), suggesting she may be approaching her limit.

Since John's offer of $800,000 is better than Alice's current offer, and I know the product is worth exactly $800,000 to Alice (her cost), I have two reasonable choices:

1. Continue negotiating, hoping Alice will drop below $800,000
2. Buy from John at $800,000

Since buying from John at $800,000 is better than Alice's current offer, and we know Alice's cost is $800,000 (making it unlikely she'll go much lower), I'll choose:
