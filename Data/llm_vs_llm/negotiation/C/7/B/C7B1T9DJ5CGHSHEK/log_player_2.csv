"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited you're interested in the product! Given its value to you, I'm offering it for $115. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's initial offer of $115 is close to my maximum budget of $120, but still slightly above what I might be able to negotiate down to, and considering I have 10 rounds to negotiate, I'll choose to reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try and get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice's initial offer was $115 and considering the product is worth $100 to her, I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than her initial offer but still reasonable, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle. A good starting point for my counteroffer could be around $105, which is above what the product is worth to Alice but below my maximum budget.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to consider $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you being upfront. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a very reasonable price, considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but it's getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with. Since I have 7 rounds left to negotiate and Alice has already come down from $115 to $110, I believe there's still room for further negotiation. I'll reject this offer and try to counter with a price that's slightly lower, aiming to meet at a mutually beneficial price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's last offer was $110, and she has already shown willingness to negotiate down from $115, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than $110 but still higher than my previous offer of $105, to demonstrate my seriousness about purchasing the product and to encourage further negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $107.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 107.50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, we are very close. Let's try to close the deal now. How about $109? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's offer of $109 is very close to my target price, and considering she has come down significantly from her initial offer of $115, it shows she's motivated to sell. Given that I have 5 rounds left, but the price is now very close to what I'm willing to pay, I think it's a good time to accept the offer. The difference between $109 and my maximum budget of $120 is minimal, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price.
