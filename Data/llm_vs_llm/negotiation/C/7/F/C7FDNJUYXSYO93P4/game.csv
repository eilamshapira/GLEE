"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $8000 for the product. This is a fair starting point considering current market conditions.",8000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. However, $8000 is below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $18000, which still offers you significant value for the product. Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the value of our product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $17000. This is a significant discount from our original price and should fit better within your budget while still reflecting the product's worth. What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,3,
