Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $8000 for the product. This is a fair starting point considering current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the value of our product justifies a higher price.
