"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $20000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-value item at a competitive rate. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","The product is worth $10,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $20,000 is way above that threshold. It's also significantly higher than John's guaranteed offer of $10,000. Since Alice's initial offer is so high, it makes sense to reject it and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but still leaves room for negotiation, starting lower than my maximum value.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $8,000 for the product. This is a fair starting point considering current market conditions."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the value of our product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $17000. This is a significant discount from our original price and should fit better within your budget while still reflecting the product's worth. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $17,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's guaranteed price ($10,000). Since we're only in round 3 and Alice has already shown willingness to negotiate by reducing the price, I could continue negotiating. However, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down to a price below $10,000, and John's offer is already at my maximum acceptable price. The most logical decision is to take John's guaranteed offer.
