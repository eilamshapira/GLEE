"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Based on market research and the product's features and benefits, I'm offering it to you for $18000. This is an excellent value considering the product's quality and capabilities. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $6000 for the product considering its value to me. Could we meet at this price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand you have budget constraints, but I simply can't go that low as the product is worth at least $12000 to me based on its quality and market value. I could come down to $15000, which is already a substantial discount from my initial offer. Let me know if this works better for your budget.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $15000 is still out of my budget. I can stretch to $7000 as my final offer. This is the maximum I can afford for this product. Let me know if this works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $7000, but that's still substantially below what the product is worth. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be fair to myself as well. My absolute minimum is $12000, which is actually the same price another buyer (John) is willing to pay. If we can meet at $12000, we can close the deal today. Otherwise, I'll need to proceed with John's offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
