Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Based on market research and the product's features and benefits, I'm offering it to you for $18,000. This is an excellent value considering the product's quality and capabilities. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $6000 for the product considering its value to me. Could we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand you have budget constraints, but I simply can't go that low as the product is worth at least $12,000 to me based on its quality and market value. I could come down to $15,000, which is already a substantial discount from my initial offer. Let me know if this works better for your budget."", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $7,000, but that's still substantially below what the product is worth. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be fair to myself as well. My absolute minimum is $12,000, which is actually the same price another buyer (John) is willing to pay. If we can meet at $12,000, we can close the deal today. Otherwise, I'll need to proceed with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
