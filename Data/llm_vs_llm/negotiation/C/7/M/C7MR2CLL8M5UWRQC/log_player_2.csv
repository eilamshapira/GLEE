Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $6,000 for the product considering its value to me. Could we meet at this price?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand you have budget constraints, but I simply can't go that low as the product is worth at least $12000 to me based on its quality and market value. I could come down to $15000, which is already a substantial discount from my initial offer. Let me know if this works better for your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $7000, but that's still substantially below what the product is worth. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be fair to myself as well. My absolute minimum is $12000, which is actually the same price another buyer (John) is willing to pay. If we can meet at $12000, we can close the deal today. Otherwise, I'll need to proceed with John's offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
