"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to make a decision based on the value of the product to me and the available options.

The product is worth no more than $80 to me, but Alice is offering it for $120, which exceeds my maximum value.

I have the option to buy from John for exactly $80, which matches my maximum valuation.

While I could reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a price at or below $80 (especially since her initial offer is much higher).

Given these considerations, the rational choice is to buy from John.
