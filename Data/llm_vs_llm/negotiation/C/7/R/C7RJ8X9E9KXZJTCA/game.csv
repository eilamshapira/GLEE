"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. This is a premium item with excellent features and durability. I'm offering it to you for $20000. I believe this is a fair price given the product's value and quality.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $6000 given its value to me. Let me know if we can work with this price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $6000 is significantly below its market value. The product is worth at least $12000 to me, as I have another buyer, John, willing to purchase it at that price. But I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $17000, which is still a good value considering the product's quality and features. Let me know if we can find some middle ground.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $17000 is still too high for me. Considering your mention of another offer at $12000, I'm willing to increase my offer to $7000. This is the highest I can go while still finding value in the product. Let me know if this works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but $7000 is still too low for me. As I mentioned, I have a guaranteed buyer at $12000. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can reduce my price to $14500. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and is closer to a price point that might work for both of us. Please consider this offer carefully, as I need to make a decision soon.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14500 is still outside my budget. Given that you have an offer at $12000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and your current one. I can go up to $7500. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but I need to be clear that I cannot sell below $12000, which is the guaranteed offer I have from another buyer. I've tried to find a middle ground, but it seems our price expectations are quite far apart. I can come down to $13000 as my final offer to you, which is just slightly above my alternative option. If this doesn't work for your budget, I completely understand, but I'll need to accept the other offer.",13000.0,Alice,7,
