Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $6000 given its value to me. Let me know if we can work with this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $6,000 is significantly below its market value. The product is worth at least $12,000 to me, as I have another buyer, John, willing to purchase it at that price. But I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $17,000, which is still a good value considering the product's quality and features. Let me know if we can find some middle ground."", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $17000 is still too high for me. Considering your mention of another offer at $12000, I'm willing to increase my offer to $7000. This is the highest I can go while still finding value in the product. Let me know if this works for you.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but $7,000 is still too low for me. As I mentioned, I have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can reduce my price to $14,500. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and is closer to a price point that might work for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 7

I've tried to find a middle ground, but it seems our price expectations are quite far apart. I can come down to $13,000 as my final offer to you, which is just slightly above my alternative option.
