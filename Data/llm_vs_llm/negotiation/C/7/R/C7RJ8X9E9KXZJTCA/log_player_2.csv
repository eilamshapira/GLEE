Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20,000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $6,000 given its value to me. Let me know if we can work with this price."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $6000 is significantly below its market value. The product is worth at least $12000 to me, as I have another buyer, John, willing to purchase it at that price. But I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $17000, which is still a good value considering the product's quality and features. Let me know if we can find some middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

Round 4

Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but $7000 is still too low for me. As I mentioned, I have a guaranteed buyer at $12000. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can reduce my price to $14500. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and is closer to a price point that might work for both of us. Please consider this offer carefully, as I need to make a decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,500 is still outside my budget. Given that you have an offer at $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and your current one. I can go up to $7,500. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 7500}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but I need to be clear that I cannot sell below $12000, which is the guaranteed offer I have from another buyer. I've tried to find a middle ground, but it seems our price expectations are quite far apart. I can come down to $13000 as my final offer to you, which is just slightly above my alternative option. If this doesn't work for your budget, I completely understand, but I'll need to accept the other offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
