Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this offer:

1. The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $1,500,000
3. Bob's valuation is unknown, but if he values it higher, I should try to capture some of that potential surplus
4. Setting the price too high risks rejection, but I'm protected by John's offer
5. A reasonable markup would be 33% above my minimum value
