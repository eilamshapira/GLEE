"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Looking at the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer for $1,000,000
2. Reject and make a counteroffer
3. Buy from John for $1,500,000

Since Alice's offer ($1,000,000) is already $500,000 less than John's price ($1,500,000) and also below the maximum value I'm willing to pay ($1,500,000), accepting this offer would be the rational choice. There's no reason to pay more by going with John, and attempting to negotiate further might risk losing this favorable deal.
