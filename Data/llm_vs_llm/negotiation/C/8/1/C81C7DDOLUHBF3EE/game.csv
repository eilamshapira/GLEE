"Hello Bob, I have a product I'd like to offer you today. This is a high-quality item that I know would be valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a better price, $90 is too low considering the quality and value of this item. I can come down a bit from my initial offer - how about $105? This is a fair price for a product that I know will be valuable to you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $95. I believe this is a reasonable price, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I need to consider the true value of this product. I can meet you part way - I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and is a fair price given the product's quality and value.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for coming down to $100. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still trying to stay within a certain budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $98. This is very close to your current offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering our negotiation so far.",98.0,Bob,6,
