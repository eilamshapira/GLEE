"Thank you for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $5000 is too low. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I counter with $18000.",18000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"Alice, I appreciate the reduction, but $18000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $7000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
