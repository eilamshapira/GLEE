Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $5000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Okay, I'm not going to accept $5,000. That's significantly below my minimum.

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $5,000 is too low. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I counter with $18,000."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, I can't go that low. How about $18,000? It's a significant reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the reduction, but $18000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $7000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","That's still too low. I need to consider my bottom line. I could try to negotiate further, but Bob is clearly trying to lowball me. I think I'll do better by selling to John.
