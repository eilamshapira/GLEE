"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given the information, let me analyze this:

- You're looking for a product worth no more than $15,000 to you
- Alice is offering to sell it for $14,500
- The product costs Alice $12,000
- You can also buy from John for $15,000

Alice's offer at $14,500 is below your maximum valuation, but there's likely room to negotiate a better price since Alice's cost is only $12,000. Since Alice has a $2,500 margin to work with, you should try to negotiate a better price.

John's offer ($15,000) is worse than Alice's current offer, so buying from John doesn't make sense at this point.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives both of us some value from this transaction.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has lowered her price from $14,500 to $14,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, there's still room for a better deal given that her cost is $12,000. The current offer is better than John's price of $15,000, but I should continue negotiating.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice is continuing to lower her price, now offering $13,750. She's moved down $250 from her previous offer of $14,000. We're getting closer to a fair price that splits the difference between her cost ($12,000) and my maximum valuation ($15,000).

At this point, I could try one more round of negotiation, but Alice has shown willingness to meet me partway. The current offer is already $1,250 better than John's alternative price.
