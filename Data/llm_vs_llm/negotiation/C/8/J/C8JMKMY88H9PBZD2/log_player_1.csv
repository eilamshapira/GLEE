"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}

I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I get a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm lowering my price from $1,500,000 to $1,000,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains a significant profit margin."
