"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend on this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $6500. This is a serious offer that I hope we can use as a starting point for our negotiation.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $6500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must emphasize that the product's value is substantially higher than your offer. I'm willing to consider a more reasonable price, but I need to ensure it's closer to the product's true worth. I'm counteroffering at $14000, which is a more realistic price considering the product's features and benefits.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $14000 is still far above my budget. While I understand you value the product highly, I need to be practical about what I can spend. I can increase my offer to $7200, which is a significant jump from my previous offer and represents the upper range of what I can reasonably afford.",7200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $7200. I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, I must reiterate that the product's value is significantly higher than your current offer. I'm willing to make a concession, but I need to ensure it's a reasonable one. I'm counteroffering at $13500, which is a more moderate price reduction from my previous offer. This price reflects the product's quality, features, and benefits, and I believe it's a fair asking price.",13500.0,Alice,5,
