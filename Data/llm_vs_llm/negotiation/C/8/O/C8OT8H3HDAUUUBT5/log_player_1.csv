"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend on this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $6500. This is a serious offer that I hope we can use as a starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $6,500 because it's significantly lower than the product's value to me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to find a price that better reflects the product's worth. I'll proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $14000 is still far above my budget. While I understand you value the product highly, I need to be practical about what I can spend. I can increase my offer to $7200, which is a significant jump from my previous offer and represents the upper range of what I can reasonably afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $7,200 because it's still below my minimum acceptable price. While I appreciate Bob's willingness to increase his offer, I need to prioritize getting a fair price for the product. Since Bob's offer is still far from my target price, I'll proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."

Round 5

However, I must reiterate that the product's value is significantly higher than your current offer. I'm willing to make a concession, but I need to ensure it's a reasonable one. I'm counteroffering at $13,500, which is a more moderate price reduction from my previous offer. This price reflects the product's quality, features, and benefits, and I believe it's a fair asking price."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
