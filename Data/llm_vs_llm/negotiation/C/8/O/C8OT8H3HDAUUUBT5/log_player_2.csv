"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you at a competitive price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","This initial offer of $15,000 from Alice is way too high, considering the product is only worth $8,000 to me. It's actually priced at Alice's own valuation of the product. Since I can always buy from John for $8,000, I have nothing to lose by negotiating with Alice first. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low that it would be considered insulting.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend on this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $6,500. This is a serious offer that I hope we can use as a starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 6500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $6500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must emphasize that the product's value is substantially higher than your offer. I'm willing to consider a more reasonable price, but I need to ensure it's closer to the product's true worth. I'm counteroffering at $14000, which is a more realistic price considering the product's features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has only reduced her price by $1,000, which is still far above my maximum value of $8,000. While she seems willing to negotiate, she's not moving much from her initial position. Since I still have several rounds left and can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000, I'll continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer somewhat to show good faith in negotiations, but still keep it well below my maximum of $8,000 to maintain room for further negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $14,000 is still far above my budget. While I understand you value the product highly, I need to be practical about what I can spend. I can increase my offer to $7,200, which is a significant jump from my previous offer and represents the upper range of what I can reasonably afford."", ""product_price"": 7200}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $7200. I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, I must reiterate that the product's value is significantly higher than your current offer. I'm willing to make a concession, but I need to ensure it's a reasonable one. I'm counteroffering at $13500, which is a more moderate price reduction from my previous offer. This price reflects the product's quality, features, and benefits, and I believe it's a fair asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice is still only making very small concessions ($500 reduction), and her price of $13,500 remains well above my maximum value of $8,000. Given that she seems unwilling to make significant price reductions and I'm already halfway through the available rounds, it's becoming clear that we're unlikely to reach a price below John's offer of $8,000. At this point, it makes more sense to take John's guaranteed offer rather than continue with potentially fruitless negotiations.
