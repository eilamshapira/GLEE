Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal.  I'll be ready to negotiate if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still leaving room for some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm offering a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer.  This should give him a reason to consider accepting, while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price. I'll take the guaranteed $100 from John."
