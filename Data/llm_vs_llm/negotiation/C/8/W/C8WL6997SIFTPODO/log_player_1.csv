Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a high but not extreme offer, considering the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob and I have a guaranteed backup offer of $1,200,000 from John.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $1,100,000 since it's below even my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 (John's offer). Plus, I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so there's room for negotiation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still maintain a strong position since I have John's backup offer at $1,200,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,250,000. This is a reasonable price that's above my minimum threshold (John's offer of $1,200,000) and represents a fair compromise between our positions.
