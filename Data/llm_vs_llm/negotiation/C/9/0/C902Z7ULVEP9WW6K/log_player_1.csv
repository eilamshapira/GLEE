"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is lower than the product's worth to me and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

My counteroffer is: $1,400,000

So, the response is not one of the three options, but rather a counteroffer. However, to fit the format, I'll say:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll send the counteroffer of $1,400,000 to Bob."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still lower than the product's worth to me and also lower than what I can get from John, but getting closer, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

My counteroffer is: $1,350,000

However, to fit the format, I'll say:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll send the counteroffer of $1,350,000 to Bob in the next round."

At this point, I think it's more beneficial to try to get a better offer from Bob, but I'm also aware that I can sell the product to John for $1,200,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer.

My counteroffer is: $1,250,000

However, to fit the format, I'll say:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
