"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since the offered price of $1,000,000 is above my maximum budget of $800,000, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and explore the possibility of getting a better deal either through a counteroffer or by buying from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable, to see how she responds. Since my maximum budget is $800,000, I'll start by offering a price that is somewhat lower, to leave room for negotiation.
