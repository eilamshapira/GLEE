Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob based on the information I have. My product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price if Bob declines.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I need to set a price that gives me upside potential while ensuring I don't lose my guaranteed sale. I'll price it significantly higher than my floor price to capture more value if Bob has high willingness to pay.
