"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer, but not so high that it would immediately drive Bob away, considering the product is worth $120 to him.

{""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $90 is below both my minimum value ($100) and John's guaranteed offer ($100), there's no reason to accept it. I also know the product is worth $120 to Bob, so there's room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer, but still maintain a price that would give me good profit, considering Bob values it at $120.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer of $95 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $100. There's no reason to accept this offer when I have a better alternative. Since we're only in round 4 and Bob is gradually increasing his offers, I'll reject and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price a bit more to show willingness to negotiate, but still maintain a price above John's offer and one that gives me good profit.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is now equal to John's offer ($100). However, since I know the product is worth $120 to Bob and we still have 4 rounds left for negotiation, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer of $102 is better than John's offer of $100. While we could continue negotiating, we're now in round 8 of 10, and Bob's incremental increases have been small. There's a risk that if I reject this offer, we might not reach a better deal in the remaining rounds, and I could end up having to take John's lower offer. I'll accept this offer.
