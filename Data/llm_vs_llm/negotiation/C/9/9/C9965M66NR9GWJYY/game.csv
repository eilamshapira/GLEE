"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product, $200 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $80 is quite lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",180.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. I really am interested, but my maximum is $100. I can buy it from John for $120 right now, so $100 is my best offer.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about being able to buy it from John for $120. I'm glad you're interested in my product, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price. Considering your maximum offer and the alternative price you mentioned, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at $140.",140.0,Alice,5,
