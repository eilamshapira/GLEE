Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product, $200 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually agreeable price. My counteroffer will be $180. This is still below my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but also reflects that I believe the product is worth significantly more than Bob's offer of $80."

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since Bob mentioned he can buy it from John for $120, and his maximum offer is $100, I'll try to split the difference between my last offer and Bob's maximum. My counteroffer will be $140. This shows I'm willing to negotiate further but also indicates that I'm aware of the product's value and the alternative prices available."

I'm glad you're interested in my product, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price.
