"Alice, that's a very high starting price. While I'm interested, I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time. This reflects the maximum value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, the product's value to us is significantly higher than $1000000. I'm willing to come down to $1400000 to meet you halfway. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1350000 is closer, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This shows my genuine interest, but I'm not willing to go any higher.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet in the middle, and I appreciate that. However, I need to maintain a minimum value for this product. I can go down to $1300000, which is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",1300000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but I must stick to a price that reflects the product's true value. My final offer to you is $1250000. This is as low as I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for us. Please let me know if you can meet at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1250000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1150000, but I'm not going any higher. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's close the deal at this point.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still below what I can accept. I'm willing to go down to $1225000, which is my final offer before I have to consider other buyers. Can you meet me at this price?",1225000.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close, but I need to stay firm on the value of this product. My final offer before exploring other options is $1225000. This is the lowest I can go while still making the deal viable for us. Let me know if you can accept this price.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
