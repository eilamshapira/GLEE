Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth at least $80 to me (my reservation price)
2. I have a guaranteed fallback option of $80 from John
3. Bob's valuation is unknown, but it might be higher than $80
4. If I price too high, Bob might reject, and I'll only get $80
5. If I price too low, I might leave money on the table

Given these factors, I should price somewhat higher than my $80 reservation price to try to capture more value, but not so high that Bob is likely to reject. A reasonable markup would be around 50%.
