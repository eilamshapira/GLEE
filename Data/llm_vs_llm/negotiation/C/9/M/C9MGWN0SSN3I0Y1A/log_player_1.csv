"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer is exactly $80, which is my minimum acceptable price (the same as what John is offering), there's no advantage to accepting Bob's offer over John's. However, I can try to negotiate a better price with Bob before defaulting to John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a more moderate counteroffer to try to find a price that works for both of us.
