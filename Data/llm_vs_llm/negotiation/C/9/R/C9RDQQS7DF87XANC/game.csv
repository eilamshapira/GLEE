"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that you're looking for a better deal. Unfortunately, $12000 is too low for us to consider. However, we're willing to meet you in the middle and reduce our price to $17000. This is a significant savings from our initial offer. We hope you find this acceptable.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, we're making progress! I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $14000 is still a bit low for us. Let's split the difference once more and set the price at $15500. This is quite close to your last offer, and I hope we can finally shake hands on this deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
