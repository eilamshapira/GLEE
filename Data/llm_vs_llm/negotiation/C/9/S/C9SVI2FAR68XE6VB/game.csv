"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20000 might be above your budget, but I believe the product's value lies somewhere in between. I'm willing to compromise and make a counteroffer. I can sell the product to you for $18000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Let me know if this price works for you.",18000.0,Alice,3,
