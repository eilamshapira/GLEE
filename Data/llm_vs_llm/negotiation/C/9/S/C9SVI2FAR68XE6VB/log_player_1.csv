"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is above my budget. I'm serious about purchasing the product, and I can offer you $12000 for it. Let me know if we can work with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the minimum amount I'm willing to accept, and I have the option to sell it to John for the same price, I'll consider my next move carefully. However, I still have 8 rounds left to potentially negotiate a better price with Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20,000 might be above your budget, but I believe the product's value lies somewhere in between. I'm willing to compromise and make a counteroffer.
