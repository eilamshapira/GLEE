"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I should consider my options carefully. The product is worth no more than $120 to me. Alice's offer is $100. Buying from John would cost $120.

*   **Accepting Alice's offer** gets me the product for $100, which is a good deal.
*   **Rejecting and counteroffering** could potentially get me a better price, but risks the deal falling through and potentially costing me more if Alice's subsequent offers are higher, or if I run out of rounds.
*   **Buying from John** is the worst option at this moment since Alice's offer is already better.

Therefore, I will accept the offer.
