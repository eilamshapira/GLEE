"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe you'd be very interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to part with it for a fair price.  I'm offering it to you for $11500.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer compared to my alternatives.

Alice is offering the product for $11,500.
The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me.
If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $12,000.

Since Alice's offer ($11,500) is $500 less than John's price ($12,000), and still below my maximum value for the product ($12,000), it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer.
