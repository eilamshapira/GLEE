"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price of $100, it would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. 

John's offer of $100 is guaranteed and matches my maximum valuation, so this is the best option.
