"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $2000000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2000000 is significantly above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and evaluation, I would be willing to offer $600000, which I believe is a fair price. I'm open to further discussion to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I must say that $600000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a concession and offer it to you for $1800000. I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $1800000 is still significantly above what I can justify for this product. I can increase my offer to $800000, which represents a substantial increase from my previous offer. This is much closer to current market rates for similar products.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. I appreciate your efforts to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I must say that $800000 is still below my expectations. Considering the product's value and the fact that I have other interested buyers, I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1500000. I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your continued flexibility, Alice. While $1500000 shows significant movement on your part, I need to be direct: I have an alternative option to purchase this product for $1000000 from another seller. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $950000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and very close to the market alternative. This would allow both of us to close the deal and move forward.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your honesty about the alternative option. I appreciate your preference to do business with me. Considering the market alternative and your previous offers, I'm willing to make a serious concession and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
