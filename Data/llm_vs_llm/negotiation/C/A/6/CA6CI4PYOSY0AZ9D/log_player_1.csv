Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2000000 is significantly above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and evaluation, I would be willing to offer $600000, which I believe is a fair price. I'm open to further discussion to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and even lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to send a counteroffer. I believe there is still room for negotiation to reach a better price. 

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I must say that $600,000 is below my expectations.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $1800000 is still significantly above what I can justify for this product. I can increase my offer to $800000, which represents a substantial increase from my previous offer. This is much closer to current market rates for similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued flexibility, Alice. While $1500000 shows significant movement on your part, I need to be direct: I have an alternative option to purchase this product for $1000000 from another seller. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $950000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and very close to the market alternative. This would allow both of us to close the deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $950,000 is still lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer. However, I will not send a counteroffer that is significantly higher than Bob's offer, as he has mentioned that he has an alternative option to purchase the product for $1,000,000. Instead, I will try to meet him in the middle, slightly above his alternative option, to make the deal more attractive to him.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your honesty about the alternative option. I appreciate your preference to do business with me. Considering the market alternative and your previous offers, I'm willing to make a serious concession and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
