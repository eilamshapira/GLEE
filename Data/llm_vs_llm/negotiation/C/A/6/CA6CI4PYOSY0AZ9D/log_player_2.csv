"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $2000000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), there's no reason to accept this offer. However, instead of immediately buying from John, I should try negotiating with Alice first to potentially get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's well below my maximum but leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and evaluation, I would be willing to offer $600,000, which I believe is a fair price. I'm open to further discussion to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I must say that $600000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a concession and offer it to you for $1800000. I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,800,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000). While she did reduce the price by $200,000, the reduction is not significant enough. I'll continue negotiating as we still have several rounds left, and there's potential for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice only came down $200,000 from her initial offer, I'll increase my previous offer modestly to show willingness to negotiate while still staying well below my maximum value.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $1,800,000 is still significantly above what I can justify for this product. I can increase my offer to $800,000, which represents a substantial increase from my previous offer. This is much closer to current market rates for similar products."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. I appreciate your efforts to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I must say that $800000 is still below my expectations. Considering the product's value and the fact that I have other interested buyers, I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1500000. I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is still above both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000). While she's showing more flexibility by reducing the price by $300,000 this time, it's still not enough to make it a better deal than John's offer. Since we're halfway through our negotiation rounds and Alice's offers are still significantly above John's price, I'll reject and make one more attempt at negotiation, but I'm getting closer to considering John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that we're past the halfway point in negotiations and Alice's last reduction was $300,000, I'll make a more substantial increase in my offer while still staying below John's price.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your continued flexibility, Alice. While $1,500,000 shows significant movement on your part, I need to be direct: I have an alternative option to purchase this product for $1,000,000 from another seller. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and very close to the market alternative. This would allow both of us to close the deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your honesty about the alternative option. I appreciate your preference to do business with me. Considering the market alternative and your previous offers, I'm willing to make a serious concession and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","While Alice has made significant movement in price (now at $1,100,000), it's still above John's guaranteed price of $1,000,000. Since I know the product is only worth $1,000,000 to me, and John's offer is exactly at this price, there's no reason to pay more than that. Given that we've gone through 7 rounds and Alice is still above John's price, it's time to take the guaranteed option.
