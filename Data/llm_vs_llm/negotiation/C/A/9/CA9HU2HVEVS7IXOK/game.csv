"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! The product sounds interesting, but $20000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $5000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but $5000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'll meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $12500 is still more than I'm hoping to spend. How about $8000? That's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $8000. However, as I mentioned earlier, I'm looking for a price that's at least $12000. Since you said $8000 is your final offer, I'll make a small concession. I'll split the difference between your offer and my minimum acceptable price.",10000.0,Alice,5,
