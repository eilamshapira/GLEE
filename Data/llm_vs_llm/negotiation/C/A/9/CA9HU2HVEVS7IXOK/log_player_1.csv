"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! The product sounds interesting, but $20000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $5000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $5,000 is too low for me, and I believe the product is worth more. Selling to John for $12,000 is an option, but I'd like to try to get a better price from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but $5,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'll meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $12500 is still more than I'm hoping to spend. How about $8000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. While $8,000 is getting closer to a price I'd be willing to consider, it's still below the minimum I'm willing to accept, which is $12,000. Since Bob said it's his final offer, I might not get a better deal from him, but I'll try to split the difference again to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $8,000. However, as I mentioned earlier, I'm looking for a price that's at least $12,000. Since you said $8,000 is your final offer, I'll make a small concession. I'll split the difference between your offer and my minimum acceptable price."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
