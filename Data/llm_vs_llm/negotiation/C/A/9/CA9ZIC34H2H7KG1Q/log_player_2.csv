"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for a special price. Would you like to buy it for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $80 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $150
3. John is willing to sell it for $80
4. My goal is to save money while getting the product

Since Alice's offer ($150) is significantly higher than both:
- The product's worth to me ($80)
- John's price ($80)

It makes no financial sense to accept Alice's offer. The best decision would be to buy from John and save $70.
