"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Looking at the options, I need to decide what's best for me as Bob.

Alice is offering the product for $200, which is $50 more than what the product is worth to me (since it's worth no more than $150 to me).

John is offering the product for $150, which is exactly at my maximum valuation.

Given these facts, it would make sense to either reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, or buy from John. Since I know I can always buy from John for $150, I have a good BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement). This gives me leverage to negotiate with Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I can always buy from John for $150, I'll use that as leverage in my counteroffer to Alice. I'll aim below that price to potentially get a better deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I see that Alice has reduced her offer from $200 to $180, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $180 is still above my alternative option of buying from John for $150.

Since I can purchase the product from John for $150, and Alice's current offer is still $30 more than that, it makes sense to continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $200 to $180, showing willingness to negotiate, I'll increase my previous offer slightly but still stay well below my John alternative of $150.
