"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Would you be willing to sell it to me at this price?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 might be too high for you. However, I believe the product is worth more than $120. I'm willing to lower my price to $170. This is a great value for the product, and I hope you'll consider it. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",170.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price to $170. However, it's still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle between my previous offer and John's offer. I'll pay $135 for the product. Would you be willing to sell it to me at this price?",135.0,Bob,4,
