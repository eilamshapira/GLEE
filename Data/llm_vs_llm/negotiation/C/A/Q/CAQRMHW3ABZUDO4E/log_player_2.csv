"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given Alice's offer of $11,000, I need to consider my options carefully:

1. Alice's offer ($11,000) is above my maximum valuation of $10,000
2. John is offering the product at exactly $10,000, which is my maximum valuation
3. I could reject and make a counteroffer, but there's no guarantee Alice will go below $10,000 given her valuation of $12,000

Since Alice's offer exceeds my maximum valuation and John's offer is exactly at my maximum acceptable price, the rational choice is to buy from John.
