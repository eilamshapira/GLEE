Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a reasonable selling price for the product that maximizes my revenue while considering Bob might reject it if too high.

If Bob rejects my offer, I have a guaranteed $150 from John. This means I shouldn't offer a price lower than $150 to Bob.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll offer a price that's reasonably higher than my minimum acceptable value. Too high might cause rejection, but I have the safety net of John's offer.
