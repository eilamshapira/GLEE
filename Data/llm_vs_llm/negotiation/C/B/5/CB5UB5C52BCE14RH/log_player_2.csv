"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1350000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth $1,000,000 to me (my maximum value)
2. Alice is offering it for $1,350,000
3. John is willing to sell it for $1,000,000

Since:
- Alice's offer ($1,350,000) is higher than my maximum value ($1,000,000)
- John's offer ($1,000,000) matches my maximum value
- Buying from John would save me $350,000 compared to Alice's offer

The logical choice is to buy from John.
