"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for a competitive price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:
1. Alice's offer is $150
2. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
3. John is offering the same product for $120
4. Alice's offer is $30 more than what I'm willing to pay

Since Alice's initial offer ($150) is above both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120), it wouldn't make sense to accept it. While I could reject and make a counteroffer, I already know that the product is worth $150 to Alice, so she's unlikely to go below that significantly. Given that John's offer matches my maximum value and is already available, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
