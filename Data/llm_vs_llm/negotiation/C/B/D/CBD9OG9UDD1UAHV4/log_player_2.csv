"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice is asking for $100, but I value the product at $80. I can buy it from John for $80. Paying $100 to Alice would be a bad decision.
