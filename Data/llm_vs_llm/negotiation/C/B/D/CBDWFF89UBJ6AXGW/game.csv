"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in this product but I'm only willing to pay $10000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $18000, considering its value and the fact that I can sell it to another buyer for $10000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to meet somewhere in the middle. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $18000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $15000, which is a good compromise. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize a deal.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $17000. This price still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to make a slight concession to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to continue negotiating. $17000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $16000?  This feels like a fair compromise, and it would allow us to close the deal. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Bob,6,
