"Hi Bob, thanks for your response! I appreciate your offer of $10000, but I need to price it higher. How about we settle at $18000? I believe this product is worth it and can provide you great value.",18000.0,Alice,3,

Thanks Alice. $18000 is still higher than I'm willing to go. My maximum budget for this is $12000. Would you consider that?,12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $12000. However, I still believe the product's value is higher. How about we meet in the middle at $15000? That's a fair price for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,5,
