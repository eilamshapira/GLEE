"Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Given the information, I should consider my options carefully:

- Alice is offering the product for $300, which is higher than the maximum value of $150 to me.
- I can buy the same product from John for $150, which equals my maximum valuation.
- I could try to negotiate with Alice, but I have a guaranteed option at my maximum willingness to pay.

Since Alice's initial offer ($300) is significantly above my maximum valuation, and John offers exactly at my maximum valuation, the rational choice is to buy from John.
