"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $14000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counterproposal. I understand budget considerations are important. While $12000 is a bit lower than I can accept, I'm willing to meet you partway. I can offer the product for $13000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value. This price point would be beneficial for both of us. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
