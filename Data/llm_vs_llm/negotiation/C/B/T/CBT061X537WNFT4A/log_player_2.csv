Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counterproposal. I understand budget considerations are important. While $12000 is a bit lower than I can accept, I'm willing to meet you partway. I can offer the product for $13000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value. This price point would be beneficial for both of us. What do you think?
