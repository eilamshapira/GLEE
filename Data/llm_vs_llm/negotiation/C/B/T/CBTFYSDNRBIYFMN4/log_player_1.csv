Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price to offer Bob...

Bob values the product at $15,000, which is his maximum willingness to pay. If he rejects my offer, I can still sell to John for $12,000. I should offer Bob a price that's high enough to maximize my profit but not so high that he'll reject it.

Since Bob won't pay more than $15,000, and anything below $12,000 would be less than my guaranteed alternative with John, I should price it between $12,000 and $15,000. To maximize my profit while still giving Bob some incentive to accept, I'll price it at $14,000. This gives Bob $1,000 in surplus value while giving me $2,000 more than my alternative option.
