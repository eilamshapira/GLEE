"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $600000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",600000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $600000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1400000, considering your interest in the product. Let me know if this works for you.",1400000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $1300000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $700000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",700000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. However, $700000 is still below our minimum threshold. I'm willing to lower the price further to $1250000, which is a significant concession on our part. Please let me know if this is something you can work with.",1250000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to lower the price. However, $1225000 is still significantly above my budget.

I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $750000 is still not feasible for us. I'm prepared to lower our price to $1210000, which is very close to our minimum threshold. This is the best I can do to meet you halfway. Let me know if this works for you.",1210000.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a solution that works for both of us. I can go down to $1205000, which is the absolute lowest I can offer while still respecting the value of the product. Please consider this as our final offer before we have to consider other options.",1205000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to lower the price, but $1205000 is still above my budget. Considering your statement that $1205000 is the absolute lowest you can offer, I'm willing to make a final attempt to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $775000, and I'm hoping you can reconsider and meet me at this price.",775000.0,Bob,8,
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $775000 is still far below our minimum acceptable price. Given the circumstances, I will have to sell the product to another buyer, John, who is willing to meet our price of $1200000. Thank you for your interest.",,Alice,8,SellToJhon
