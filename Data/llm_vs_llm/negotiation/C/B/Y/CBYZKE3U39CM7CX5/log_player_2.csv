"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I know you recognize the immense value this product holds. I'm offering it to you for $1650000. This represents a fair premium considering its unique capabilities and the significant benefits it will bring to your operations. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to me and Alice's offer of $1,650,000 exceeds that value, it would be more cost-effective to buy the product from John for $1,500,000.
