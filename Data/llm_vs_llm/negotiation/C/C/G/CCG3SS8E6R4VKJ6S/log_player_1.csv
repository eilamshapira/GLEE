Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $130 is higher than the minimum value of $100 that I have for the product, and we are still in the early rounds of negotiation, I would like to try to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll try to meet Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. Since my initial offer was $150 and his counteroffer was $130, I'll offer $140.
