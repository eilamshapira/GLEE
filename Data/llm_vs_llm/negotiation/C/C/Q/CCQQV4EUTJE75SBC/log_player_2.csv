"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is quite high, considering the product is worth only $800,000 to her. However, it's still $100,000 less than John's price of $1,500,000.

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. This gives me an opportunity to potentially get a better price, knowing I can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations fail.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice at a significantly lower price to leave room for negotiation, but still being reasonable compared to the product's value to her.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her price from $1,400,000 to $1,200,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is a significant improvement and is now $300,000 less than John's price. However, there's still likely room for further negotiation since her cost is $800,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I see Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, which is a good sign. I'll increase my previous offer to show good faith in the negotiation while still trying to get a good deal.
