"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to make a decision about whether to accept Alice's offer, make a counteroffer, or buy from John.

Alice is offering the product for $150, which exceeds my maximum value of $100. Since I know I can buy the product from John for exactly $100, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at $150.

I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I can always buy the product from John for $100, I have a strong alternative that sets my maximum price. However, I'll try to get a better deal from Alice by making a reasonable counteroffer below that price.

I should reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has only reduced her price by $10, suggesting she might be willing to negotiate further, but is doing so slowly. I need to be a bit more assertive but still reasonable in my counteroffer. Since I can always get the product for $100 from John, I'll try to get a better deal from Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice is slowly coming down in price ($150 → $140 → $130), which suggests she may be willing to negotiate further. Since we're now in round 6 out of 10, I need to be more strategic with my counteroffer. I'll raise my offer slightly to show good faith in the negotiation while still keeping it well below John's price.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","We're now at round 8 of 10, and Alice has been gradually lowering her price ($150 → $140 → $130 → $120). Given the limited rounds remaining and Alice's negotiation pattern, I'll increase my offer slightly to try to reach an agreement below John's price.
