Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a reasonably high offer to leave room for negotiation while still maintaining good profit potential.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This offer of $4,000 is far too low, being significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. It's not even worth continuing negotiation at this point since I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000.
