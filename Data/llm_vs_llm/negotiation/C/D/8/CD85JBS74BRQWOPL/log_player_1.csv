"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product and I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start by making a high offer. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially settle on a higher price than if I started with a lower offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and also lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,200,000), accepting it would not be beneficial.

Selling the product to John for $1,200,000 is a safer option, but since we are in the early stages of negotiation and I have 8 more rounds to potentially reach a better deal with Bob, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and proceed with a counteroffer.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $500,000, which is far from my desired price, I'll make a counteroffer that is still high but slightly lower than my initial offer to show that I'm willing to negotiate. This will also give me insight into whether Bob is willing to increase his offer.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's new offer of $600,000 is still significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,200,000). Accepting this offer would not be beneficial.

While Bob has increased his offer from $500,000 to $600,000, it's still a long way from what I'm looking for. However, the fact that he increased his offer suggests he's interested in the product and might be willing to go higher.

Given that I have 6 more rounds to negotiate and selling to John for $1,200,000 is a guaranteed but lower return compared to my hopes for this negotiation, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer again and make another counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob increased his offer to $600,000, I'll respond by lowering my price but still keeping it significantly higher than his offer. This round, I'll aim to reduce the gap between our prices slightly, encouraging further negotiation.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob has increased his offer again, this time to $700,000, which shows he's still interested in the product. However, his offer is still below the minimum value I have for the product ($1,200,000).

At this point, I've reduced my offer from $2,500,000 to $2,000,000, trying to meet Bob halfway. Bob has also been increasing his offers, but very gradually. Given that we're halfway through the negotiation rounds, I need to decide whether to continue negotiating or secure a sale with John.

Since Bob's latest offer of $700,000 is still far from my target and even from the minimum I'm willing to accept ($1,200,000), and considering I have 4 more rounds to potentially reach a better agreement, I'll reject his offer once more. However, I'll also start considering the guaranteed sale to John more seriously if the next rounds don't bring significant improvements from Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Given that Bob has increased his offer to $700,000 and I've previously lowered my price to $2,000,000, for this round, I'll make a more significant reduction to try and bridge the gap between our prices. I'll aim for a price that's still profitable for me but also more appealing to Bob, considering his gradual increases.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob has increased his offer to $850,000, which is a more significant jump from his previous offer of $700,000. This indicates he's seriously interested in the product and willing to pay more for it.

However, his offer is still below the minimum value I have for the product ($1,200,000). Considering we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, I need to weigh the potential of getting a better offer from Bob against the certainty of selling to John for $1,200,000.

Given that Bob's offer is still $350,000 short of my minimum acceptable price and we only have 2 rounds left, the likelihood of him meeting or exceeding my minimum price seems low. Therefore, accepting his current offer would mean selling the product for less than its value to me.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's latest offer was $850,000 and we're nearing the end of the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one but still above my minimum acceptable price. This will be my last attempt to meet Bob's price in a way that works for both of us.

Given the situation, I'll aim for a price that's closer to my minimum but still reflects the product's value. Considering Bob's gradual increases, I hope he'll be willing to meet me at this price.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's final offer is $1,000,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 but still $200,000 short. Given that this is the last round of negotiation, I must decide whether to accept Bob's offer, reject it, or sell the product to John for $1,200,000.

Accepting Bob's offer would mean selling the product for less than its value to me, which isn't ideal. Rejecting his offer without an alternative would end the negotiation without a sale. Selling to John, on the other hand, guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price.

Considering the options and the fact that Bob's final offer is still below my minimum, the best decision is to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This ensures I meet my minimum price requirement and secure a sale.
