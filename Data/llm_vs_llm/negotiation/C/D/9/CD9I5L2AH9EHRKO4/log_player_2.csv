"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm offering it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:
1. Alice is offering the product for $150
2. John is also selling it for $150
3. The product is worth no more than $150 to me
4. I can negotiate with Alice to try to get a better price

Since Alice's initial offer is the same as John's price, there's no advantage in accepting it immediately or buying from John. It makes sense to try negotiating with Alice to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower to leave room for negotiation but not so low as to be offensive.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $150 is a bit high for me. I can offer $90 for it. This would be a fair price that works within my budget."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $90 is too low for this quality product. I can offer it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has reduced her price from $150 to $140, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is already better than John's fixed price of $150. However, since she came down $10 from her initial offer, there might still be room for further negotiation. Let's try to get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $150 to $140, showing willingness to negotiate, I'll increase my previous offer but still try to get a better deal.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. Your product does seem valuable, but I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. Would you consider $115? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}"
