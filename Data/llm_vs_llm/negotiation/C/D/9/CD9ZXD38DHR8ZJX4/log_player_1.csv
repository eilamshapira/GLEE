Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob
2. My minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000 (which I can get from John)
3. Bob will accept if he gets some value from the deal
4. The maximum surplus in this deal is $300,000 ($1.5M - $1.2M)

I should offer a price that leaves some value for Bob to incentivize him to accept, but captures most of the surplus for myself. A price of $1,400,000 would give Bob $100,000 in value while giving me $200,000 more than my alternative (John's offer).
