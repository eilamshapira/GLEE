"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below this threshold, it's a viable option. However, I also know that Alice values the product at $1,200,000, which means there might be room for negotiation. 

Given that rejecting Alice's offer would lead to buying the product from John for $1,500,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay, it seems prudent to try and negotiate with Alice or at least consider if her offer is the best I can get without immediately accepting. 

But since the instructions are to either accept, reject, or buy from John without an option to negotiate, and given that $1,400,000 is less than $1,500,000, the logical choice to save as much money as possible while still acquiring the product would be to accept Alice's offer, as it is the cheapest option presented.
