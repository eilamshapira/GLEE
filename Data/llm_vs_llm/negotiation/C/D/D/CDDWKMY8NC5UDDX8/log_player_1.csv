Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's estimated value. This will give me room to negotiate while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to settle for that price. I'll try to counteroffer and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

I'm lowering my price slightly from the first offer, but still leaving room for some profit. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't settle for a price that is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still a bit low. I'm willing to take a bit less than my initial asking price, but not that much. I'm hoping I can get closer to my goal with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}

I'm now offering the product at my minimum acceptable price. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll move on to John."
