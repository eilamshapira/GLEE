"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice is offering the product for $950,000, but it's only worth $800,000 to me. That means I would lose $150,000 by accepting her current offer. John is offering exactly $800,000, which matches my maximum valuation, so I would break even with that option.

Since we have 10 rounds of negotiation available, it makes sense to try negotiating with Alice first to see if I can get a better price than $800,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her offer from $950,000 to $850,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still $50,000 more than what John is offering ($800,000) and what the product is worth to me.

Since Alice has moved significantly in my direction, I should continue negotiating to see if I can get an even better price.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has now offered $800,000, which is the same price John is offering and equal to my maximum valuation. Since I can't do better than break even at this point, and Alice has moved her price down from $950,000 to $800,000, I should accept this offer.
