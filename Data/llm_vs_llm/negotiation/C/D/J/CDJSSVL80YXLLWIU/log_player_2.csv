"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its exceptional quality and rarity, I believe it's worth a premium price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000, which I think is a fair price considering its value. If you're interested, please let me know and we can finalize the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $20,000, which is twice my maximum budget, I will reject Alice's offer. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $10,000, which aligns with my budget.
