Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe its value aligns well with your needs. How about we start with a price of $9500?,9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but I can't go as low as $7000. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to offer the product for $8500.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Meeting in the middle is a good idea, but I was thinking more of meeting in the middle between my previous offer of $7000 and your initial offer of $9500. That would put us at around $8250. I'm willing to do $8200, considering the product's value to me.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. How about we settle on a price of $8750? I believe it's a fair compromise.",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, Alice. However, $8750 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Considering the product's worth to you is $8000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and the product's worth to you. That would be $8375. I'm willing to do $8400, which is slightly above that midpoint, as a gesture of good faith.",8400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Your offer of $8400 is close, but I would like to propose a final price of $8600. I hope we can reach an agreement.",8600.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Alice. Your final price of $8600 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, but I need to feel like I'm getting a fair deal. I'll meet you at $8500, which is higher than my previous offers, but still below your last proposal. This is my final counteroffer before I consider other options.",8500.0,Bob,8,
