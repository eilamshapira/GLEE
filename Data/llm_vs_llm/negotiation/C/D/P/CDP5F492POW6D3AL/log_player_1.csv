Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, Alice. However, $8750 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Considering the product's worth to you is $8000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and the product's worth to you. That would be $8375.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Alice. Your final price of $8600 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.
