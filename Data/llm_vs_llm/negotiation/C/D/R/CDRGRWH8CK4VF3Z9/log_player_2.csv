"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you at $9500. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer of $9,500 is less than my maximum budget of $10,000, I'll consider it. However, I'd like to try to negotiate a better price. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I don't know the value of the product to Alice, I'll start by offering a price that's significantly lower than my maximum budget.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
