"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $250. It's a great value and I think you'll really appreciate it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $80 to me
2. Alice's offer is $250, which is significantly higher than my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $80, which matches my maximum value

The logical choice is to buy from John. There's no reason to accept Alice's extremely high offer or engage in negotiations when there's already a guaranteed option at my maximum acceptable price.
