# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I should reject Alice's offer because her offer is $10,000 which is the maximum price I want to pay. I can also buy the product from John at $10,000. Since the goal is to save as much money as possible, I should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, I'll send Alice a counteroffer. My goal is to get the best possible price, keeping in mind the product is worth $8,000 to her and I'm willing to pay up to $10,000. I'll aim for something in between.
