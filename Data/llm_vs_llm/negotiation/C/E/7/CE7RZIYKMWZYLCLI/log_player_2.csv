"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll analyze the situation:
1. Alice's offer is $140
2. My maximum value is $150
3. John's fixed price is $150
4. Alice's cost is $80, so there's room for negotiation

Alice's initial offer of $140 is below my maximum value ($150) and below John's price ($150), but since this is just the first round and Alice's cost is $80, there's likely room to negotiate for a better price. I should reject and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's cost is $80 and her initial offer was $140, I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower but still reasonable. I'll propose a price roughly halfway between her cost and her initial offer.

{""product_price"": 110}

This offer:
1. Gives Alice a decent profit margin ($30 above her cost)
2. Saves me $40 compared to John's price
3. Leaves room for further negotiation if needed
4. Is a reasonable counteroffer to her $140 initial price"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has reduced her price from $140 to $125, which is a significant improvement. This represents:
1. A $25 drop from her initial offer
2. $25 less than John's price
3. Still gives Alice a good profit margin ($45 above her cost)

While there might be some room for further negotiation, this is a good offer considering:
1. We're only in round 3 of 10, but momentum is positive
2. The price is well below John's alternative ($150)
3. The risk of losing progress if we push too hard
4. It's a fair price that saves me money

I'll accept this offer as it represents a good value and eliminates the risk of potentially losing the deal.
