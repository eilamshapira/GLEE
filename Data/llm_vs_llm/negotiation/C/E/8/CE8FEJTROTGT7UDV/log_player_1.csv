"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed with a counteroffer since his offer of $12,000 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but I believe we can reach a better agreement.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000}"
