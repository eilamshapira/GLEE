Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about a strategic price...

I want to maximize my earnings, but I need to balance between setting a high price and the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. Since I have a guaranteed backup offer of $1,500,000 from John, I can be relatively aggressive with my pricing to Bob. A reasonable markup would be around 33% above my minimum value.
