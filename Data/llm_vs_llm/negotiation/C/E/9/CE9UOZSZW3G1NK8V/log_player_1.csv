"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,500,000) and also lower than what I initially offered ($2,000,000), and considering I have the option to sell it to John for $1,500,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I am willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Thus, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be $1,800,000, which is lower than my initial offer but still reflects the high value I place on the product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $800,000 is still below the minimum value I have for the product ($1,500,000). Given that I have the option to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer, I will not accept Bob's offer. 

However, I am willing to continue negotiating to see if Bob is willing to meet me closer to my desired price. Since Bob has increased his offer from $700,000 to $800,000, it indicates he is willing to negotiate. I will make another counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground that is more favorable to me.

My next counteroffer will be $1,600,000, which is a reduction from my previous offer of $1,800,000, showing that I am willing to negotiate, but still reflects the high value of the product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $1,000,000 is closer to what I consider a reasonable price, but it's still below the minimum value I have for the product ($1,500,000) and also below my last counteroffer ($1,600,000). Given that Bob has now reached the maximum value he is willing to pay, as indicated by the problem statement ($1,000,000), further negotiation may not yield a higher offer from him.

Considering I have the option to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is $500,000 more than Bob's current offer, and since Bob has reached his limit, I will not accept Bob's offer of $1,000,000.

Given that further negotiation with Bob may not be fruitful and that I have a guaranteed higher offer from John, I will choose to sell the product to John.
