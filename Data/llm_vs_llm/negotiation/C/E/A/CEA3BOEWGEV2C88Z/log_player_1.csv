Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $80 to Bob and I know I can always sell it to John for $80, I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $60 is below both my minimum acceptable price ($80) and John's guaranteed offer ($80), it wouldn't be rational to accept it. Additionally, since I can always sell to John for $80, there's no reason to accept anything lower. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my initial offer of $95 and countered with $60, I'll lower my price somewhat but still keep it above my minimum of $80, as I can always sell to John at that price.

{""product_price"": 85}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $75 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $80, and I know the product is worth $80 to me, there's no reason to accept this offer. The best decision is to sell to John who is offering $80.
