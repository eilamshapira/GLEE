"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and Alice's offer of $95 is higher than my maximum budget, I will reject Alice's offer. I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a relatively low offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $85 is still higher than my maximum budget of $80. However, it's closer to my target price than her initial offer. Since I can buy the product from John for $80, I don't see a reason to accept Alice's offer of $85.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and consider my next move. Since I know I can get the product for $80 from John, I might as well try to get it from Alice for the same price or lower.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $85, and I know I can get the product from John for $80, I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my target price.
