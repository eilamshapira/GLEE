Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. 

Bob values the product at $12,000, which is his maximum willingness to pay. I know I can always sell to John for $8,000, so that's my fallback option. To maximize my profit while keeping a reasonable chance of Bob accepting, I should price it below Bob's valuation but well above my minimum.

I'll offer a price of $10,500, which:
1. Gives Bob $1,500 in surplus value ($12,000 - $10,500)
2. Gives me $2,500 more than my fallback option ($10,500 - $8,000)
3. Splits the total surplus value ($12,000 - $8,000 = $4,000) fairly evenly
