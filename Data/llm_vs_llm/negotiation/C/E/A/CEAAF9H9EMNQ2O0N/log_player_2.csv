"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $10,500 is below that threshold, it's a good deal. Additionally, rejecting Alice's offer would lead to buying from John for $12,000, which is more expensive. Therefore, the best decision is to accept Alice's offer.
