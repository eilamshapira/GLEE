Send your offer to Bob.,"Since I want to maximize my earnings and I know I have a guaranteed $8,000 from John, I'll start with a higher price to test Bob's willingness to pay.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the same as John's guaranteed offer ($8,000), and it's equal to my minimum acceptable price, there's no advantage in accepting Bob's offer over John's. However, since I can still make counteroffers, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate for a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my initial high offer of $12,000 and countered with $8,000, I'll try a more moderate price to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob has offered $9,000, which is $1,000 more than John's guaranteed offer of $8,000. Since Bob has moved up from his previous offer and is now offering more than my minimum acceptable price, I'll accept this offer.
