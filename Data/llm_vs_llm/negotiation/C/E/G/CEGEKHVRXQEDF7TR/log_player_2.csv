"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Looking at the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $120
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: $120

Since Alice is offering the product at $120, which is the same price John is offering and also equal to my maximum value for the product, I'm indifferent between options 1 and 3. Since the product is worth $120 to me, buying it at $120 means I break even - I don't save any money, but I don't lose any either.
