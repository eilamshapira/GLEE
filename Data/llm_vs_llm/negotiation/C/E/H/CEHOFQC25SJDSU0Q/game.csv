"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000, considering my budget and other options available in the market.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but $8000 is significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $15000, but I'm willing to work with you. I can offer you the product for $16000, which is lower than my initial offer.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $16000 is still above my budget. Considering you mentioned another buyer is willing to pay $15000, I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and that price. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product.",11500.0,Bob,4,
