"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000, considering my budget and other options available in the market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. Bob's offer of $8,000 is too low as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I have guaranteed buyer John at $15,000, but I'll give Bob another chance with a lower price than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $15,000, but I'm willing to work with you. I can offer you the product for $16,000, which is lower than my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $16000 is still above my budget. Considering you mentioned another buyer is willing to pay $15000, I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and that price. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John. Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and since John is willing to pay $15,000, it makes more financial sense to sell to him. There's no guarantee that further negotiations with Bob will result in a price above $15,000, and we've already gone through 4 rounds without reaching an acceptable price."
