Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $10,000 to him, I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get more than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.

{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $10,000, I will sell to John.
