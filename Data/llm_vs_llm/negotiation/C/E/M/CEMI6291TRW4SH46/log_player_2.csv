"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given the information:
- The product is worth no more than $80 to me
- Alice's offer is $150
- John is willing to sell the same product for $80

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum valuation and also higher than John's alternative offer. It doesn't make sense to accept this offer.

I could reject and make a counteroffer to Alice, but I already know that John's price ($80) is equal to my maximum valuation. Since I can't get a better deal than what John is offering, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice.
