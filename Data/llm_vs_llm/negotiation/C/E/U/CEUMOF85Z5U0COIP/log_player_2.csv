"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is too high. It's best to start negotiating to see if you can get a price closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
``` 

This is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for Alice to counter and for us to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice is coming down on her price, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth negotiating a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
``` 

This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($9,000) and my previous offer ($6,000).  It shows willingness to move closer to her price while still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. Buying from John guarantees you get the product at your target price."
