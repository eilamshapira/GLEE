"Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I'm offering for sale. It's in excellent condition and delivers exceptional value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a high-quality item that would typically sell for much more, but I'm offering you a special rate. Would you be interested?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $20000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and offer. While I appreciate your proposal, $8000 is below my minimum threshold for this product. The product is valued considerably higher, and I have significant investment in it. I could come down to $16000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This is a high-quality product that provides excellent value at this price point. Would you consider this revised offer?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your investment in the product, but $16000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12000.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
