Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and offer. While I appreciate your proposal, $8,000 is below my minimum threshold for this product.

This is a high-quality product that provides excellent value at this price point. Would you consider this revised offer?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your investment in the product, but $16000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12000.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
