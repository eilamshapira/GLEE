Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and offer. While I appreciate your proposal, $8000 is below my minimum threshold for this product.

This is a high-quality product that provides excellent value at this price point. Would you consider this revised offer?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
