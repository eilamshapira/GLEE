"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $1400000? That's still a great price for such a valuable product.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $1200000 was too low, but $1400000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
