"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer and decide if it's worth accepting, rejecting to make a counteroffer, or buying from John instead.

Alice is offering the product for $2,000,000, which is significantly higher than both:
1) My maximum value for the product ($800,000)
2) John's guaranteed offering price ($800,000)

Since Alice's offer exceeds my maximum value, accepting it would mean overpaying by $1,200,000, which makes no economic sense. I could make a counteroffer, but John's price already matches my maximum value, so there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice unless I believe I can get it for less than $800,000.

The rational choice is to buy from John at $800,000.
