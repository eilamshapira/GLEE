"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand that the product is of high quality, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product, considering its features and value.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. The product is worth at least $150 to me based on its quality and market value. However, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. I can sell it to you for $165, which is already a good reduction from my initial price.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $165 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer $140 for the product, which I believe is a fair price.",140.0,Bob,4,
