"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $25000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
