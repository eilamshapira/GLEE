"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Let me start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum acceptable price of $120.

{""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","I will reject Bob's offer of $60 as it's well below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Since I have John's guaranteed offer of $120, I won't accept anything lower than that. Let me make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat but still maintain a strong position since I have John's offer as a backup.

{""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer of $70 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and his small increase from $60 to $70 suggests he's not likely to reach my minimum price. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, and we've already gone through 4 rounds with Bob showing little movement toward an acceptable price, it's best to end the negotiation and take John's offer.
