Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe the price of $2700000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I'd like to propose a more reasonable price. Considering the market value, I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. I'm open to further negotiations if needed.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While I appreciate your offer of $900,000, I'm afraid it falls significantly below the product's actual value and my minimum acceptable price. The quality and features of this product command a premium in the market. However, I understand budget constraints and am willing to adjust my initial asking price.

While $1,050,000 shows we're making progress, it still falls considerably below the product's market value and my minimum threshold.
