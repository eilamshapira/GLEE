Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $900000, I'm afraid it falls significantly below the product's actual value and my minimum acceptable price. The quality and features of this product command a premium in the market. However, I understand budget constraints and am willing to adjust my initial asking price. I can offer it to you for $2100000, which represents a substantial reduction from my initial price. This is a competitive offer considering the product's true value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the increase in your offer. While $1050000 shows we're making progress, it still falls considerably below the product's market value and my minimum threshold. I should mention that I already have another buyer, John, who is prepared to purchase at $1500000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. My counteroffer is $1800000, which represents a significant reduction from my previous price and is much closer to what would make this deal viable for me. This offer demonstrates my willingness to find middle ground while still reflecting the product's true value.
