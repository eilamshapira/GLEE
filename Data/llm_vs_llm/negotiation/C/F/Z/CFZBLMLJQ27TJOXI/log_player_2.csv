"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given the current offer of $15,000, I am indifferent between accepting Alice's offer and buying from John, as both cost the same amount. However, I want to save as much money as I can.

Since I don't know the value of the product to Alice, there's a chance she'll accept a lower price. Rejecting and making a counteroffer gives me the possibility to get the product for less than $15,000.

Therefore, I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, I will make a counteroffer. I want to try to get the product for a lower price, but I also don't want to risk losing the deal entirely, so I'll offer a price slightly below the initial offer.
