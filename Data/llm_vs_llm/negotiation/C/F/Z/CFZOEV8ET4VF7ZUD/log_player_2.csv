"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she's asking for $15,000 for the product. This exceeds the maximum value I'm willing to pay ($8,000) and is also significantly higher than John's alternative offer of $8,000.

Since Alice's price is nearly double what I can get elsewhere, there's no reason to accept this offer. While I could try to negotiate with Alice through a counteroffer, I already know that John will sell me the product at exactly my maximum valuation.
