"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $100 is a bit high for me. I know similar products are available for less. Would you consider selling it for $70? This would still give you a decent return.",70.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I considered your offer and I'm willing to lower my price. How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for lowering the price, Alice. However, I can actually get this product elsewhere for $80. I'm still interested in buying from you, and I can offer $75. This would help me save a bit while still giving you a sale. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've reconsidered. If you can add just a little more, let's say $82, we have a deal. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,5,
