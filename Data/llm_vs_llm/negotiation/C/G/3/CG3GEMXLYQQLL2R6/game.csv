"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I believe the price is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $5000 for the product, considering its unique value.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5000 is unfortunately far below what I can accept for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $17000 to meet you halfway.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $5000 was a bit low. However, $17000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our previous offers, so I'll offer $7000 for the product. This is close to my maximum budget, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $7000 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12000 as a final offer.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you can see its value.",12000.0,Alice,5,
