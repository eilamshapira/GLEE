"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the product's rarity and the investment required to acquire it, I'm prepared to offer it to you for a price of $30000. This is a special offer, and I believe it is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $30,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $30,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer of $30,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $10,000 and John's offering price of $10,000, it makes the most sense to buy from John. While Alice emphasizes the product's rarity and value, I cannot justify paying three times my maximum budget when I have a guaranteed option at $10,000.
