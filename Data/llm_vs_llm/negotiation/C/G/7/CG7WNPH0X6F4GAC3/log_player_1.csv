"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum value. I believe that $10,000 is a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even though it's closer to my desired price.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm coming down to $9,000. It's still a decent amount for me, and it shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While this offer is closer, it's still not quite meeting my minimum value.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can push for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7

{""product_price"": 8500}

This is my last attempt to negotiate with Bob. If he rejects this, I'm selling to John."
