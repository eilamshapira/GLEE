"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my exclusive product for $1000000. This is a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its unique value. Let me know if youâ€™re ready to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
It's best to start negotiating. Alice's first offer is her starting point, and there's room to bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we start at $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation and shows I'm serious about buying."
