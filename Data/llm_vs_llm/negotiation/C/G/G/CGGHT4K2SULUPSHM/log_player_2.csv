"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $10,000 is still $2,000 below my maximum budget of $12,000, I have room to negotiate for a better price. Given that the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's potential for a lower price. Therefore, I'll reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a mutually beneficial price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's initial offer was $10,000 and the product is worth $8,000 to her, I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than her initial offer but still reasonable, aiming to save as much money as possible. A good starting point could be somewhere in between Alice's worth and my maximum budget, slightly favoring my budget to leave room for further negotiation.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $9,500 is a step closer to my target of saving as much money as possible, but it's still $1,500 above what the product is worth to her. Since I have a maximum budget of $12,000 and Alice's offer is $2,500 below that, I have room to continue negotiating. Given that Alice has already come down from $10,000 to $9,500, it indicates she is willing to negotiate. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, trying to bring the price even closer to $8,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's latest offer was $9,500 and she has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing the price from $10,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one to demonstrate my seriousness in purchasing the product while still aiming to save money. Given the product's worth to Alice is $8,000, I'll aim for a price that splits the difference between her latest offer and my previous counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $9,200 indicates she is continuing to come down in price, showing flexibility in the negotiation. This offer is $300 lower than her previous one, which suggests she is trying to meet me halfway. Given that I initially aimed to save as much money as possible and my maximum budget is $12,000, $9,200 is still a significant savings from buying from John. However, since Alice has come down this far, I might be able to squeeze out a slightly better deal. But considering we are halfway through the negotiation rounds and the price is getting closer to a reasonable compromise, I need to weigh the potential benefits of further negotiation against the risk of losing the deal.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given Alice's latest offer of $9,200 and considering we're halfway through the negotiation rounds, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one to show I'm willing to compromise. Since Alice has already come down significantly from her initial offer of $10,000, I'll aim for a price that's closer to her latest offer but still tries to split the difference between her offer and my previous counteroffer. This approach should demonstrate my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial price while maximizing my savings.
