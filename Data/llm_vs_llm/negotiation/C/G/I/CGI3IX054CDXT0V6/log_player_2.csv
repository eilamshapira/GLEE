"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. It's a high-quality item that I'm offering for $250. This is an excellent value based on the market. Would you like to purchase it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer of $250 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100), there's no reason to accept this offer. While I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, given that her initial offer is so high ($250), it might be difficult to reach a price below $100. The safe and rational choice would be to buy from John at $100.
