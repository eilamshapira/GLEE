"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you think $130 is a fair price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $145. I believe this product is unique and of high quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that reflects its value. I'm open to further negotiation, but I hope we can meet closer to this price.",145.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price. While I understand your point about the product's quality, I can find similar products elsewhere. To meet you partway, I'm willing to increase my offer to $135. This represents a fair middle ground between our positions and would still give you a good return.",135.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $135. I appreciate your willingness to meet me partway. After considering your offer, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'll sell the product to you for $140, which is a significant discount from my original price. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise between our positions.",140.0,Alice,5,
