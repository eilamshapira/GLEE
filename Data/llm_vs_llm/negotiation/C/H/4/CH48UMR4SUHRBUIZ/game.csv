"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $110. This is a fair price considering the product's worth.",110.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I think the product is valuable, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to propose a lower price.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is too low considering the product's value. Let's meet closer to the middle - I can offer it to you for $100. This represents a significant discount from my initial price and would be a fair deal for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about we settle on $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
