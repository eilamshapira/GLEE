Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $110. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I think the product is valuable, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to propose a lower price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. $90 is too close to my minimum acceptable price of $80, and since I know the product is worth $120 to Bob, there's room for a better deal for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is too low considering the product's value. Let's meet closer to the middle - I can offer it to you for $100. This represents a significant discount from my initial price and would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about we settle on $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $95. This is a reasonable compromise that gives both of us value. It's significantly better than my alternative of selling to John for $80, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
