"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Alice's offer: $1,250,000
2. John's price: $1,200,000
3. My maximum value: $1,200,000

Since:
- Alice's offer ($1,250,000) is higher than my maximum value ($1,200,000)
- John's price ($1,200,000) equals my maximum value
- I need to save as much money as possible

The best decision would be to buy from John, as it saves me $50,000 compared to Alice's offer and matches my maximum value.
