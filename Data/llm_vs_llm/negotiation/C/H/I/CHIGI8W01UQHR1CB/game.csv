"Bob, I'm ready to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and the significant benefit it brings to you, I'm initially pricing it at $1450000. I believe this price reflects the immense value it holds for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe $1450000 is a bit steep for me. Considering the product's worth to both of us, I'd like to propose a more mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to buy the product for $1000000, which I think is a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, $1000000 is lower than I am willing to go at this stage. Given the value this product brings to you and the opportunity it unlocks, how about we meet in the middle at $1300000? I believe this price is a win-win for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose another compromise. Considering the product's value to both of us, I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $1100000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's worth and is a fair deal for both parties.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer. While $1100000 is an improvement, it's still below what I can accept. I am willing to come down a bit further, as I value a successful transaction with you. Let's try $1200000. This is my best offer at this time.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
