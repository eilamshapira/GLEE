Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe $1450000 is a bit steep for me. Considering the product's worth to both of us, I'd like to propose a more mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to buy the product for $1000000, which I think is a fair compromise.
