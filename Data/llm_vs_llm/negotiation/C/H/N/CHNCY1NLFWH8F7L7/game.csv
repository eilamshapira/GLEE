"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $12000 is quite high for my budget. Given the market conditions, I can offer $9000 for the product. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more aligned with my budget. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to lower my price to $11000, which is still a significant discount from the original offer but reflects the product's true worth. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
