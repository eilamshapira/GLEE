"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this quality product. Based on market research and the product's features, I believe it provides excellent value. I'm offering it to you for $180. This is a competitive price for a product of this caliber. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $100
2. Alice is offering the product for $180
3. John is offering the product for $100
4. Since Alice's price ($180) is significantly higher than both:
   - My maximum value ($100)
   - John's alternative price ($100)

This is an easy decision. Alice's offer of $180 is not acceptable because:
- It's $80 more than my maximum value
- It's $80 more than John's price
- There's no reason to pay more when I can get the same product for $100

Therefore, I should buy from John.
