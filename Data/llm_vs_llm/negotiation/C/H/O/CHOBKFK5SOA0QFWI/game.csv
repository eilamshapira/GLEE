"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product that's worth $1200000. While I know you might have your own valuation, I'm willing to offer it to you at $1200000, which represents its fair market value. This is the same price another buyer, John, is already willing to pay. I'd be happy to sell it to you at this price, but if we can't reach an agreement, I do have John's offer as a backup.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
