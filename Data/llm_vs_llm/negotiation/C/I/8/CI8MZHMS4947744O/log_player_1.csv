Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer ($120) is below my minimum acceptable price ($150), and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, instead of immediately selling to John, I'll try one more negotiation round with Bob since there might be potential for a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial price somewhat but still keep it well above my minimum to maintain room for negotiation while ensuring a profitable outcome.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer ($140) is still below my guaranteed price from John ($150), and Bob's increments in offers have been relatively small, it's best to take the sure deal with John rather than continue negotiating with Bob.
