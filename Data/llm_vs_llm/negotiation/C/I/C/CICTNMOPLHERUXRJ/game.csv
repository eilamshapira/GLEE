"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While I understand budget constraints, I need to consider the true value of this product. I can come down from my initial price, but $12000 is still too low. I can offer it to you for $17000, which I believe is a fair price considering its quality and value.",17000.0,Alice,3,
