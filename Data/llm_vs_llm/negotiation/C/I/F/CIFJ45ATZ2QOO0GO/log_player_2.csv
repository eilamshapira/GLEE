"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $2,000,000 is above my maximum value of $1,500,000, so accepting it would result in a loss. Since I can always buy from John for $1,500,000, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to negotiate a better price with Alice. If negotiations don't go well, I still have the option to buy from John later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer and John's price, which gives room for negotiation. If Alice accepts, I'll save $500,000 compared to buying from John. If she counters, we can still negotiate upward while staying below my maximum value of $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,800,000 is still above my maximum value of $1,500,000, and it's also higher than John's price. There's no reason to accept this offer when I can get the product for less from John. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, trying to get a price below $1,500,000. If Alice doesn't come down to a reasonable price, I can still exercise the option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'll increase my previous offer to $1,200,000. This is a $200,000 increase from my last offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a good margin below both John's price and my maximum value. This gives Alice room to counter while keeping the negotiation moving in a constructive direction. If Alice accepts, I'll save $300,000 compared to buying from John. If she counters, we still have room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John for $1,500,000. Here's why:

1. Alice's latest offer ($1,700,000) is still above both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's price ($1,500,000)
2. While Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate by reducing her price, the decrements are relatively small (from $2M to $1.8M to $1.7M)
3. Given this pattern, it's unlikely Alice will drop her price below John's $1,500,000 in the remaining rounds
4. Rather than spending more time negotiating and risking ending up with no better option, it's most rational to take John's guaranteed price of $1,500,000

This ensures I get the product at my maximum acceptable price without further delay or uncertainty."
