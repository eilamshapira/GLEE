"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given that Alice's offer is $1,500,000, which exceeds the maximum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me, it doesn't make sense to accept this offer. Since John offers the product for exactly $1,000,000, which is my maximum valuation, it's better to buy from John rather than continuing a negotiation where I might not achieve a better price than John's.
