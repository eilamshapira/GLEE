"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $18000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations if you're interested.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at $8000.  Would you consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $8000 is too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a concession and offer it to you for $15000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, and I'm open to further negotiations.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $15000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $11000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. I'm open to closing the deal if you're willing to meet me at this price.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting close. I'm willing to offer you $11500. That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to get this great product from you.",11500.0,Bob,6,
