"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Based on the information provided, I need to decide whether to accept or reject Alice's offer of $200, or to buy from John for $80.

The product is worth no more than $80 to me (Bob), and John is offering to sell it for exactly $80. Alice's offer of $200 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation and John's price.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, the rational choice is to buy from John for $80 rather than accept Alice's much higher offer of $200.
