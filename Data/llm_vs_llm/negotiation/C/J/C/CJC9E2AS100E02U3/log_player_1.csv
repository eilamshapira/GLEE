"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for round 1:

{""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, given Bob's low counteroffer of $50, I need to make a quick decision. Rejecting and continuing the negotiation *could* lead to a better price, but the risk is that Bob's offers will remain low or he might stop negotiating altogether. I need to consider the time constraint (10 rounds). Since I can sell to John for $150 right now, and I know I can't go lower than $150, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, given that Bob offered $50 and I know the product is worth at least $150 to me, I need to increase my offer significantly from the first round. I don't want to scare him off, but I also want to get the best possible price.

Here's my counteroffer for Round 3:

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","This is a tough spot. Bob is clearly lowballing me. I *could* accept the $60, but that's significantly less than what the product is worth to me and what I could get from John. I still have several rounds left and a shot at a better offer.

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, I need to try and get Bob to come up in his offer. I'll try a slightly lower price than the last offer, but still significantly higher than what he's offering. I'll also see how he reacts to this new offer.

Here's my counteroffer for Round 5:

{""product_price"": 170}"
