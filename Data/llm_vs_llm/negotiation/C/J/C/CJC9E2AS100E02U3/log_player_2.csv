"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to decide carefully. The product is worth no more than $80 to me, so paying $200 would be a very poor decision. Alice's initial offer is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. Since John is willing to sell me the exact same product for $80 (which is my maximum valuation), I could go with that option.

However, I can also try negotiating with Alice first to see if I can get a better price. Since I have the option to buy from John at any time, there's no risk in trying to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's substantially lower than Alice's initial price but still gives her room to negotiate.

{""product_price"": $50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has reduced her price from $200 to $180, which shows some willingness to negotiate. However, this is still much higher than my maximum valuation of $80. Since I can buy the product from John for $80 (which equals my maximum valuation), Alice would need to offer a price below $80 for me to accept.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice is only making small reductions in her price (from $180 to $170) and remains far above my maximum valuation of $80. There doesn't seem to be much progress toward reaching a price that would be acceptable to me.

Given that I can buy the product from John for $80 (which is exactly my maximum valuation), and Alice hasn't shown willingness to come anywhere close to this price, it makes sense to end this negotiation.
