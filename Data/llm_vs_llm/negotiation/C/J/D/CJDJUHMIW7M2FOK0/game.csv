"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $15000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product is worth more than $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $12500. This price reflects the product's true value and is a compromise on my part.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10000.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12500 is still out of your range. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $11500. This price is more in line with your budget while still acknowledging the product's worth. I hope we can meet at this price.",11500.0,Alice,5,
