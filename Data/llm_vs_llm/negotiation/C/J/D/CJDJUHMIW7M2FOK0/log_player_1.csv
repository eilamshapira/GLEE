Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its worth."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us. My counteroffer will be $12,500. This is still below my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but also emphasizing the product's value. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $15,000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product is worth more than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $12,500. This price reflects the product's true value and is a compromise on my part."", ""product_price"": 12500}"

Bob's offer:

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since he's sticking to his $10,000 offer, I'll try to find a price that's closer to his budget but still reflects the product's value. My next counteroffer will be $11,500. This is a further compromise on my part, showing that I'm willing to work with Bob to find a mutually acceptable price.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that $12,500 is still out of your range. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $11,500.
