Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate down if Bob is interested."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
