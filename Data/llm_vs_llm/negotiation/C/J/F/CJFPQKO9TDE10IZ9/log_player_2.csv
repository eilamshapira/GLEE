"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer matches the maximum price I'm willing to pay, there's a chance I can get a better deal. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer (about 33% less) gives us room to negotiate upward while still potentially securing a good deal.  Alice may be motivated to accept a lower price for a quick sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice reducing her price suggests she's willing to negotiate. While $13,000 is a better deal, there's still room to potentially lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's Round 3 offer and my Round 2 offer.  It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but in smaller increments now.  I'm aiming to save as much as possible, so I'll counteroffer again to test her flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 12000
}
