"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'll analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $115
2. The product is worth $100 to Alice, so she has room to go lower
3. John's price is $120, which is my worst-case scenario
4. The product is worth no more than $120 to me

Since Alice's offer ($115) is less than John's price ($120), but I know Alice can still go lower (since the product is worth $100 to her), it makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. This way, I might be able to get an even better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know the product is worth $100 to Alice, and she offered $115, I'll make a counteroffer that's above her cost but below her initial offer. I'll propose $105, which gives her a small profit while saving me money.

{""product_price"": 105}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let's analyze the updated situation:

1. The negotiation has progressed from $115 → $105 (my offer) → $110 (Alice's new offer)
2. Alice has moved down $5 from her initial offer
3. $110 is a $10 saving compared to John's price of $120
4. While Alice might still have room to go lower, she's already made a concession

This is a good offer because:
- It's significantly better than John's price
- Alice has shown willingness to negotiate but might not go much lower
- The risk of continuing to negotiate might not be worth the potential small additional savings

Therefore, I'll accept this offer.
