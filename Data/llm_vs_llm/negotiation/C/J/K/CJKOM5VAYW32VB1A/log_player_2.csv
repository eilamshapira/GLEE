"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $12,000
2. Alice is offering the product for $14,000
3. John is offering the product for $12,000

Since Alice's offer ($14,000) is higher than my maximum value ($12,000), and John's offer ($12,000) matches my maximum value, the logical choice is to buy from John.
