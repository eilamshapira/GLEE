"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000), it would not be rational to accept her offer. Given that John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value, and it's a guaranteed option, the best decision would be to buy from John.
