"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($12,000), and I have the option to buy the same product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in accepting Alice's offer immediately. However, I also don't want to give up on the potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of getting a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable considering the product's value to her is $10,000. My goal is to save as much money as possible, so I'll start with a lower offer and see how Alice responds.

{""product_price"": $8,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has come down from her initial offer of $12,000 to $11,000, which is a positive sign. However, I still believe there's room for negotiation since the product is worth $10,000 to her. Accepting $11,000 would save me $1,000 compared to buying from John, but I'm aiming to save as much as possible.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer, trying to meet somewhere in the middle between my previous offer of $8,000 and Alice's current offer of $11,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll prepare to make a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice has moved down to $11,000 and considering her product value is $10,000, I'll aim for a price that's closer to her bottom line but still slightly above it, to ensure the deal is attractive for both parties. I previously offered $8,000, so I'll increase my offer to show willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price.

{""product_price"": $9,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has now moved her offer to $10,500, which is getting closer to the value she has for the product ($10,000). This indicates she's willing to negotiate and potentially make a sale. 

Considering my goal is to save as much money as possible and I have a limit of $12,000, accepting $10,500 would not only save me $1,500 compared to buying from John but also get me the product for just $500 above Alice's valuation. This seems like a reasonable deal, especially since we're halfway through the negotiation rounds and I don't want to risk Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further or the deal falling through.

Given this, I think $10,500 is a fair price, and I'm willing to accept it to ensure I get the product.
