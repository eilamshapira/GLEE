"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll analyze this offer:

- Alice is offering the product for $100
- I know the product is worth no more than $150 to me
- John is willing to sell me the same product for $150

Alice's offer of $100 is $50 less than John's price and within my acceptable range. This is a good deal for me since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible.
