"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. Based on my research, this product is worth $15000 in the market, and I'm offering it to you for $13500. This gives you a good value while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Are you interested in this offer?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your initial offer. While I see the value in the product, my budget is tighter. I'd be willing to move forward if we can settle at $10000. Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand budget constraints, I need to consider the true value of this product. The market value is $15000, and my costs are significant. I can come down to $12800, which still provides you with excellent value - saving you over $2000 compared to market price. This is a fair middle ground between our positions. How does this sound?",12800.0,Alice,3,
"Alice, I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm aiming for a bit more savings. How about we settle at $11000? Please let me know if that works for you.",11000.0,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your flexibility so far. Given my budget limitations, I'm willing to improve my offer slightly. How about meeting in the middle at $11500? I believe this strikes a fair balance between our positions.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your improved offer and your willingness to find a middle ground. I've considered your budget limitations carefully. I can reduce my price to $12200, which is quite close to your offer. This represents a substantial discount from the market value of $15000 and would be a very advantageous deal for you. I hope we can close this deal at this price point, as it's really the lowest I can go while still covering my costs and making a minimal profit.",12200.0,Alice,5,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12200. However, to better align with my budget constraints, could we settle at $11800? Let me know if that works for you.",11800.0,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. To move us closer to a deal, I'm prepared to adjust my offer slightly to $12000. I believe this figure fairly reflects both our positions and would allow us to finalize the transaction promptly. Please let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Bob,6,
