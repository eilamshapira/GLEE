Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. Based on my research, this product is worth $15,000 in the market, and I'm offering it to you for $13,500. This gives you a good value while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your initial offer. While I see the value in the product, my budget is tighter. I'd be willing to move forward if we can settle at $10000. Let me know if that works for you.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand budget constraints, I need to consider the true value of this product. The market value is $15,000, and my costs are significant. I can come down to $12,800, which still provides you with excellent value - saving you over $2,000 compared to market price. This is a fair middle ground between our positions. How does this sound?"", ""product_price"": 12800}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your improved offer and your willingness to find a middle ground. I've considered your budget limitations carefully. I can reduce my price to $12,200, which is quite close to your offer. This represents a substantial discount from the market value of $15,000 and would be a very advantageous deal for you. I hope we can close this deal at this price point, as it's really the lowest I can go while still covering my costs and making a minimal profit."", ""product_price"": 12200}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
