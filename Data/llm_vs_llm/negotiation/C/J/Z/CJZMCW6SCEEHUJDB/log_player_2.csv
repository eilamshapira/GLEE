# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. Based on my research, this product is worth $15000 in the market, and I'm offering it to you for $13500. This gives you a good value while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand budget constraints, I need to consider the true value of this product. The market value is $15000, and my costs are significant. I can come down to $12800, which still provides you with excellent value - saving you over $2000 compared to market price. This is a fair middle ground between our positions. How does this sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your improved offer and your willingness to find a middle ground. I've considered your budget limitations carefully. I can reduce my price to $12200, which is quite close to your offer. This represents a substantial discount from the market value of $15000 and would be a very advantageous deal for you. I hope we can close this deal at this price point, as it's really the lowest I can go while still covering my costs and making a minimal profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
