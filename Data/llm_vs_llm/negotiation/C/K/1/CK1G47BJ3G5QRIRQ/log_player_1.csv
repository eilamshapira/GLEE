Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a moderately high offer, considering that I can always sell to John for $15,000 and the product is worth $12,000 to Bob.

{""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and even below his own valuation ($12,000), and I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $15,000, the best decision is to sell to John.
