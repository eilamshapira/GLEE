"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, I must inform you that I already have another buyer willing to pay $1500000 for the product. Given this, and considering the product's true value, I can reduce my initial asking price to $1800000. This is still a fair price that reflects the product's worth while giving you room for good returns on your investment.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your increased offer. However, as I mentioned, I have a firm offer of $1500000 from another buyer. To make this deal work with you, I can come down to $1650000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offers. This price would be advantageous for both of us, considering the product's value.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
