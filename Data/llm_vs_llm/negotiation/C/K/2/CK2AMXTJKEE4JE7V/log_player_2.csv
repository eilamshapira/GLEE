(Let's start negotiating. Alice's initial price is way too high, so I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.)

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, I must inform you that I already have another buyer willing to pay $1500000 for the product. Given this, and considering the product's true value, I can reduce my initial asking price to $1800000. This is still a fair price that reflects the product's worth while giving you room for good returns on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your increased offer. However, as I mentioned, I have a firm offer of $1500000 from another buyer. To make this deal work with you, I can come down to $1650000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offers.
