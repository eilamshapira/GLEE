"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000), I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. There's no reason to accept a price higher than my alternative option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 900000}

I'll offer $900,000, which is significantly below John's price of $1,200,000. This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to save money compared to my alternative option. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate towards a middle ground, and I always have John's offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer because:
1. The price ($1,200,000) matches John's alternative offer
2. It equals my maximum value for the product
3. There's no potential benefit in continuing negotiation or switching to John, as we've reached the best possible price for me
4. Further negotiation might risk losing this fair offer, and I wouldn't be able to get a better deal from John anyway"
