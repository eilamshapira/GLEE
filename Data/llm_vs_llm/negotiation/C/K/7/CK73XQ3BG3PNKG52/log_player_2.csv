"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $2,250,000
3. John is offering it for $1,500,000

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation and John's price. It would not be rational to accept Alice's offer when I can get the same product from John at a much lower price that matches my maximum valuation.
