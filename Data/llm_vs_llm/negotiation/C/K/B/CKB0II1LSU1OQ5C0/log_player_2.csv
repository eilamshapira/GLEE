"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll really like.  I'm offering it to you for $175. It's a fair price, and it's worth every penny. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Reason: The offer price of $175 is higher than my budget of $150. I can buy the same product from John for $150, so I will reject Alice's offer and consider buying from John instead."
