Bob's offer:

You have three options:

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually agreeable price. My next offer will be $180.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $180 is still too high for me. My budget is limited. Would you consider $75?

You have three options:

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a price that works for both of us. Since Bob's budget is limited, I'll try to be more flexible. My next offer will be $150.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is still out of your budget. I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I can offer you the product for $150. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 150}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $150 is still more than I can afford. My final offer is $90. If that doesn't work for you, I understand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's final offer is $90, which is still lower than my minimum acceptable price and the price John is willing to pay, I'll consider selling to John. However, I'll make one last attempt to negotiate with Bob. My next offer will be $120, which is the same price John is willing to pay.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer of $90. However, I have another buyer willing to pay $120 for the product. I'm willing to give you one last chance to match that price. If you're willing to pay $120, the product is yours."", ""product_price"": 120}"
