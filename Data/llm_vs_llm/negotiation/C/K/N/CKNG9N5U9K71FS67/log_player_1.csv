Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to choose a price to offer Bob, considering that I can always sell to John for $80 if Bob rejects my offer.

Since I don't know how much the product is worth to Bob, I'll offer a price that gives me a reasonable chance of making more than my guaranteed $80 from John, while not being so high that Bob will likely reject it.
