Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a price that maximizes my expected return. If I price too high, Bob might reject and I'll get $100 from John. If I price too low, I might leave money on the table.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll set a price that gives me a reasonable chance of making more than my guaranteed $100 from John, while not being so high that Bob will likely reject it.

{""product_price"": 150}"
