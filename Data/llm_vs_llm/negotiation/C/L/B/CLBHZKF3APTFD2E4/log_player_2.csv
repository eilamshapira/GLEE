"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Given that the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and John is offering it at exactly $12,000, there's no way I would accept Alice's offer of $20,000. Since we have multiple rounds of negotiation available, I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to get a better price than even John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 8000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $8,000. This is significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer of $20,000 and John's fixed price of $12,000. This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to get a better deal than John's price. If Alice rejects this and counters with a price still above $12,000, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $18,000 is still significantly higher than John's fixed price of $12,000, and it's also above my maximum value of $12,000. While Alice has reduced her price from $20,000 to $18,000, the reduction isn't substantial enough. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, as there's still room for negotiation and we have several rounds remaining. If we can't reach a price below $12,000, I can always take John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9000}

I'll increase my previous offer slightly to $9,000, showing some willingness to negotiate while still staying well below John's price of $12,000. This modest increase from my previous offer of $8,000 signals that I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm also firm about staying below $12,000 since that's both my maximum value and my alternative option with John. If Alice doesn't come down significantly in the next round, I might consider switching to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still moving in the right direction but remains significantly above both my maximum value and John's price of $12,000. While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing the price from $18,000 to $16,000, we're still not close enough to make a deal. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, but if Alice doesn't come down substantially in the next rounds, I'll likely take John's offer as we're halfway through our negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 10000}

I'll increase my offer to $10,000, which represents another step up from my previous offer of $9,000. This shows continued willingness to negotiate while still staying below John's price of $12,000. We're now in the latter half of our negotiation rounds, so if Alice doesn't come down to a price below $12,000 soon, I'll need to seriously consider taking John's offer rather than risk running out of negotiation rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer of $15,000 is still well above John's price of $12,000
2. While Alice has been gradually reducing her price ($20k → $18k → $16k → $15k), the rate of reduction suggests we're unlikely to get below $12,000 in the remaining rounds
3. We've already used 7 of our 10 rounds, and Alice is still $3,000 above John's price
4. The product is only worth $12,000 to me anyway, so there's no point in paying more
5. Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of running out of rounds and potentially losing the opportunity to buy from John

Therefore, it's most rational to take John's guaranteed offer of $12,000 now rather than risk further negotiation with Alice that's unlikely to result in a better deal."
