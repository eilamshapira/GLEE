Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 120} 

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This accomplishes two things:

* **Maximizes potential profit:** If Bob values the product very highly, he might accept this offer, giving me the best possible outcome. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can always lower the price in a subsequent round and still potentially sell it for more than $80."
