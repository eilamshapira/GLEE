"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  I'm willing to work with you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $112.50? ",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $112.50 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $118.  This is my final offer.",118.0,Alice,5,
