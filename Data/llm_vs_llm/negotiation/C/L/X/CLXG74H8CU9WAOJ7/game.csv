"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can we discuss this further?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but I really can't go below a certain price. How about we meet in the middle at $180? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $180 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering I can get a similar product from John for $150, I'd like to propose $140. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",140.0,Bob,4,
