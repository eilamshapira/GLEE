"Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. I believe this product will be of great value to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $200. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While the product sounds interesting, $200 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and I can actually get it from another seller for that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can come to a reasonable agreement. Would you consider selling it for $75? This would give me a reason to buy from you rather than the other seller.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and transparency about the other offer. However, $75 is too low for me considering the quality and value of the product. Since you mentioned you can get it for $100 elsewhere, I can offer you the product for $140. This price reflects the superior quality and service I provide compared to other sellers. Would this work for you?",140.0,Alice,3,
