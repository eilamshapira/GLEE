"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. I believe this product will be of great value to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While the product sounds interesting, $200 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and I can actually get it from another seller for that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can come to a reasonable agreement. Would you consider selling it for $75? This would give me a reason to buy from you rather than the other seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob mentioned he values the product at $100 and can get it from another seller at that price, I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. His current offer of $75 is too low, considering I can get $120 from John. Also, if Bob can get it for $100 elsewhere, he might be willing to pay around that price to me as well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and transparency about the other offer. However, $75 is too low for me considering the quality and value of the product. Since you mentioned you can get it for $100 elsewhere, I can offer you the product for $140. This price reflects the superior quality and service I provide compared to other sellers. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
