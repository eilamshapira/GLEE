"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. I believe this product will be of great value to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to make a decision based on the goal of buying the product while saving as much money as possible.

Alice is offering the product for $200, which is more than the $100 that the product is worth to me.

Since John is willing to sell the same product for $100, and that price equals the maximum value I'm willing to pay, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer of $200.

I could reject and make a counteroffer, but I already know I can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no reason to pay more than that.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While the product sounds interesting, $200 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and I can actually get it from another seller for that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can come to a reasonable agreement. Would you consider selling it for $75? This would give me a reason to buy from you rather than the other seller."", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and transparency about the other offer. However, $75 is too low for me considering the quality and value of the product. Since you mentioned you can get it for $100 elsewhere, I can offer you the product for $140. This price reflects the superior quality and service I provide compared to other sellers. Would this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $140 is still above the $100 maximum value that the product is worth to me. Additionally, I can get the same product from John for $100, which matches the maximum value I'm willing to pay.

There's no reason for me to pay $140 when I can get the product for $100, which is its worth to me. While I could continue negotiating, the best outcome would be reaching a price at or below $100, and I already have that option available with John.
