"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","The offer from Alice is $150, which is significantly higher than the product's worth to me (up to $100) and also higher than John's price ($100).

Given that I can get the product from John for $100, which is already at my maximum valuation, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $150 or to continue negotiating when the starting point is so high.
