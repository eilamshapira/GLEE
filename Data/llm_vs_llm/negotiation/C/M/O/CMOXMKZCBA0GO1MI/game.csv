"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $6500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $8500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $8500 is still a bit beyond what I'm looking to spend. Could you do $7000?  That would work well for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $7750? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let me know what you think.",7750.0,Alice,5,
