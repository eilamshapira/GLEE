"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price of $1375000. This is a great deal for both of us. The product is valued at $1500000, so you'll be getting $125000 in value by accepting this offer. I have another buyer, John, who is already willing to purchase this product, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity since I believe this would be more beneficial for you. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with this purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to analyze this situation carefully to make the best decision:

- The product is worth up to $1,500,000 to me (my maximum value)
- Alice's offer is $1,375,000
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $1,500,000
- My goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible

Alice's offer ($1,375,000) is $125,000 less than John's price ($1,500,000) and still within my maximum value threshold. Buying from Alice would save me $125,000 compared to buying from John.

There's no reason to reject Alice's offer only to pay more to John, so I should accept Alice's offer.
