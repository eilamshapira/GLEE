"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to offer you this exclusive product for a price that reflects its rarity and significance. I'm confident you'll appreciate the value. My initial offer is: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $1,800,000, I need to evaluate if this is a good deal for me.

The product is worth at most $1,200,000 to me, and I can already buy it from John for exactly $1,200,000. Alice's current offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation and John's price.

Since Alice's offer exceeds what I'm willing to pay, and I have a guaranteed option to purchase from John at my maximum valuation, the rational choice is to go with option 3.
