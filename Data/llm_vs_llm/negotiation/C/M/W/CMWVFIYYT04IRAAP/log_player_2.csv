"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this exclusive product for $25000. Let me know if you accept this price or if you have a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than my budget and what I could get from John. I will try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $25,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 5000
}
```

I'm starting with a low offer to see how Alice reacts and get a sense of her bottom line. It's a common negotiation tactic to start low and work up."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your candid feedback. I understand your position, but given the quality and value of this product, I can offer it at $20000. This is a fair price considering its worth, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While Alice came down a bit, $20,000 is still too high. I'll continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for considering my offer. I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $20,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to go up to $7,500.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still staying significantly below her last offer.  The goal is to gradually move towards a mutually agreeable price without conceding too much too quickly."
