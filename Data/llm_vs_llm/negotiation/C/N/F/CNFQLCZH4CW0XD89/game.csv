"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is above my budget. I would like to make a counteroffer of $12000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12000 is too low for this product. I've already reduced my initial asking price, and I can offer it to you for $17500. This is a significant reduction from my first offer, and it reflects the true value of the product.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. While I understand your position, $17500 is still a bit above my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $14000 for the product, which I believe is a reasonable compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
