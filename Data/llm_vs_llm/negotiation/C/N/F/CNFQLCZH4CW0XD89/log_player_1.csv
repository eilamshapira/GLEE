"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I know would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $20,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is above my budget. I would like to make a counteroffer of $12000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I know I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I won't accept anything lower than that.

I will proceed to make a new counteroffer to Bob in the next round, slightly lowering my initial price to show some flexibility in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is too low for this product. I've already reduced my initial asking price, and I can offer it to you for $17,500. This is a significant reduction from my first offer, and it reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. While I understand your position, $17500 is still a bit above my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $14000 for the product, which I believe is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I will sell to John for $15,000. Bob's latest offer of $14,000 is still below what John is willing to pay, and since Bob's previous offers have been consistently below my minimum acceptable price, it seems unlikely that we'll reach a deal that's better than John's guaranteed $15,000. It's better to take the sure deal with John rather than continue negotiations that might not lead to a better outcome."
