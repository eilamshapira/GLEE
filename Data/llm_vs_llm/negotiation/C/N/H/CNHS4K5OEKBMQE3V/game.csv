"Bob, I believe this product holds immense value for you, and I'd like to offer it to you at a price that reflects its potential.  I'm asking for $1400000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and its significance to me. Let's see if we can strike a deal.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the value you see in the product, $1400000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1200000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market and my budget constraints. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000,  This price still allows me to recoup a significant portion of the value the product holds for me.  I believe this is a fair compromise and a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1300000 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $1250000. This is my final offer, as it's the highest I can go while still making the deal work for me. I hope we can find common ground at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
