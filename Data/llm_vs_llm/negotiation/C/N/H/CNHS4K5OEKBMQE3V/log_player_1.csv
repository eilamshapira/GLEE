Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the value you see in the product, $1400000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1200000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market and my budget constraints. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
