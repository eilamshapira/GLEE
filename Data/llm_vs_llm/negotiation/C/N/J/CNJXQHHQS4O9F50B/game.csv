"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $25000. What do you say?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25000 is far too high for me. I have another seller offering the same product for $8000, so I couldn't possibly consider anything above that price. Given that, I would be willing to offer $5000 for your product.",5000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $5000 is significantly below my expectations. I'm willing to lower my price to $20000, considering your budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $18000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
