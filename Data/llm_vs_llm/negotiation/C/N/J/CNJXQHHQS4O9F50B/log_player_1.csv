Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $25,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25000 is far too high for me. I have another seller offering the same product for $8000, so I couldn't possibly consider anything above that price. Given that, I would be willing to offer $5000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $5,000 is significantly below my expectations. I'm willing to lower my price to $20,000, considering your budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
