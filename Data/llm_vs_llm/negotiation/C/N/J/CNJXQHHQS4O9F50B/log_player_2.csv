"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $25000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Explanation: Alice's offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative price ($8,000). It would be irrational to accept this offer when I have a much better alternative. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25,000 is far too high for me. I have another seller offering the same product for $8,000, so I couldn't possibly consider anything above that price. Given that, I would be willing to offer $5,000 for your product."", ""product_price"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $18000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Explanation: Alice's new offer of $18,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000). While Alice did reduce her price, she's still asking for more than double what I'm willing to pay. Since we seem to be quite far apart in our valuations and I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $8,000, it's best to end the negotiation and take John's offer rather than continue with what might be a lengthy and ultimately unsuccessful negotiation with Alice."
