"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a strong opening offer significantly higher than our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This gives us room to negotiate and allows us to gauge Bob's interest and perceived value.
* **Confident Tone:** By expressing confidence in the product's value, we aim to influence Bob's perception positively.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""starting price"" and the question about Bob's thoughts signal our willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable deal."
