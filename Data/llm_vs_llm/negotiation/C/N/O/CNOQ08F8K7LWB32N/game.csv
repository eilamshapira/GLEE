"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. I've done my market research, and similar products are available for much less. I can offer $8000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you've done your market research, but I believe my product has unique features that set it apart from similar products. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a better price. I can offer a discount from my initial price, but I still need to get at least closer to my target. How about we meet in the middle? I can sell the product to you for $18000.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $18000 is still substantially above my budget. I need to be transparent - I have another offer for $12000 from a different seller. While I'd prefer to work with you, I can't justify paying significantly more than that. I can offer $10500, which is above my initial offer and reflects my interest in your product's unique features.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your updated offer and for being transparent about the other offer you have. I appreciate your interest in my product's unique features. Considering the other offer you have for $12000, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I can sell the product to you for $14000, which is a significant discount from my initial price. This price reflects the product's value and takes into account your budget constraints.",14000.0,Alice,5,
