"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. I've done my market research, and similar products are available for much less. I can offer $8000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $8,000 because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you've done your market research, but I believe my product has unique features that set it apart from similar products. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a better price. I can offer a discount from my initial price, but I still need to get at least closer to my target. How about we meet in the middle? I can sell the product to you for $18,000."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $18000 is still substantially above my budget. I need to be transparent - I have another offer for $12000 from a different seller. While I'd prefer to work with you, I can't justify paying significantly more than that. I can offer $10500, which is above my initial offer and reflects my interest in your product's unique features. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $10,500 because, although it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal. Since Bob mentioned he has another offer for $12,000 from a different seller, I'm aware that he's willing to pay up to that amount. I'll send a counteroffer that's competitive with the other seller's price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your updated offer and for being transparent about the other offer you have. I appreciate your interest in my product's unique features. Considering the other offer you have for $12,000, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I can sell the product to you for $14,000, which is a significant discount from my initial price. This price reflects the product's value and takes into account your budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
