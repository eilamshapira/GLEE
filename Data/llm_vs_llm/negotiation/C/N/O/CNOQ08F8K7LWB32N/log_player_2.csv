"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'll analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $12,000
2. Alice's initial offer is $20,000, which is significantly above my maximum value
3. I have John's guaranteed offer of $12,000 as a backup
4. There are still 9 more rounds available for negotiation
5. Alice's opening offer is very high, suggesting room for negotiation

Given that Alice's offer ($20,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price ($12,000), and considering we have many rounds left to negotiate, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20,000 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. I've done my market research, and similar products are available for much less. I can offer $8,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 8000}

This counteroffer strategy:
1. Starts low ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation upward
2. Remains below my maximum value ($12,000)
3. Provides a polite but firm response
4. References market research to justify the lower price
5. Keeps the negotiation open by suggesting this is a ""starting point""

If Alice rejects this, we still have 8 more rounds to negotiate, and I always have John's $12,000 offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you've done your market research, but I believe my product has unique features that set it apart from similar products. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a better price. I can offer a discount from my initial price, but I still need to get at least closer to my target. How about we meet in the middle? I can sell the product to you for $18000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let's analyze Alice's new offer:

1. Alice only dropped the price by $2,000 (from $20,000 to $18,000)
2. This is still $6,000 above John's price of $12,000
3. More importantly, it's still well above my maximum value of $12,000
4. Alice's small reduction and message suggest she's not willing to make large price reductions quickly
5. We still have 7 rounds left, but Alice's negotiation style seems to be moving very slowly

Given that:
- The current offer is still far above my maximum value
- Alice's small reduction suggests this could be a very slow negotiation
- I have a guaranteed option of $12,000 from John
- Even after several more rounds, we might not get below $12,000

This might be a good time to use our alternative option with John. However, let's give Alice one more chance with another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $18,000 is still substantially above my budget. I need to be transparent - I have another offer for $12,000 from a different seller. While I'd prefer to work with you, I can't justify paying significantly more than that. I can offer $10,500, which is above my initial offer and reflects my interest in your product's unique features."", ""product_price"": 10500}

This counteroffer strategy:
1. Reveals my BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement) of $12,000
2. Shows I'm willing to move up from my initial offer
3. Still stays below my maximum value
4. Acknowledges Alice's point about unique features
5. Creates urgency by letting her know I have alternatives
6. Sets a realistic anchor point for negotiations

If Alice doesn't respond with a reasonable counter close to or below $12,000, I should seriously consider taking John's offer in the next round, as Alice's negotiation pattern suggests she might not come down to an acceptable price within our remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your updated offer and for being transparent about the other offer you have. I appreciate your interest in my product's unique features. Considering the other offer you have for $12000, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I can sell the product to you for $14000, which is a significant discount from my initial price. This price reflects the product's value and takes into account your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let's analyze the current situation:

1. Alice has finally made a significant move, dropping to $14,000
2. However, this is still $2,000 above my maximum value of $12,000
3. More importantly, it's $2,000 above John's guaranteed offer
4. While Alice is now negotiating more reasonably, she's still above both my maximum value and my alternative option
5. We have 5 rounds left, but there's no guarantee Alice will go below $12,000

Given that:
- Alice's offer is still above my maximum value
- I have a guaranteed option at $12,000 from John
- Even if Alice reduces further, it might not be enough to beat John's offer
- I've already revealed John's price, and Alice still stayed above it
- Time is valuable, and continuing negotiations carries opportunity cost

The most rational decision at this point is to take John's offer. There's no logical reason to pay $14,000 when I can get the same product for $12,000, which is already my maximum value point.
