"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a high offer to maximize my potential earnings. Considering the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, I'll start with an even higher price.

{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is below my minimum value of $1,000,000, I'll reject his offer. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safer option, but I'll try to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $600,000, I'll try to find a middle ground while still aiming high. I'll reduce my initial offer of $2,000,000, but not by too much, to see if Bob is willing to meet me closer to my desired price.

{""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly my minimum value, and selling to John would also give me $1,000,000. Since I've already invested time in negotiating with Bob, I might as well accept his offer, as it doesn't make sense to continue negotiating for the same price I can get from John.
