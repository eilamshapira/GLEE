"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Looking at this offer, I need to decide what's best for me as Bob.

Alice offers the product for $120, but it's only worth up to $100 to me. If I accept Alice's offer, I'd be paying $20 more than what the product is worth to me.

Meanwhile, John is willing to sell me the same product for $100, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, the logical choice is to buy from John for $100 rather than accept Alice's higher price of $120.
