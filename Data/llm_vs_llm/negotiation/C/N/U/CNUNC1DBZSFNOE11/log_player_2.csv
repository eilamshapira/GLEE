"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I should carefully consider Alice's offer of $1,400,000. The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, and no more than $1,500,000 to me. While Alice's price is below my maximum, I can likely get a better deal by negotiating. John's offer of $1,500,000 is my backup option if negotiations fail, but Alice's current offer is already $100,000 better than John's, so there's no reason to go with John now. I should reject and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above her valuation of $800,000. This gives room for negotiation while still allowing her to make a profit.

{""product_price"": $950,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her asking price by $100,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. Her current offer of $1,300,000 is still $500,000 above her valuation of $800,000, giving her a very healthy profit margin. Meanwhile, it's $200,000 less than John's offer. I still believe there's room to negotiate a better price, so I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still aim for a fair middle ground that gives Alice a good profit while saving me money compared to her last offer.

{""product_price"": $1,050,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice continues to reduce her price, now down to $1,200,000, which is $300,000 less than John's offer. She's moving in the right direction, reducing by $100,000 each round. While this is a significant improvement, I still think there's room to negotiate further since the product is worth $800,000 to her. We have several rounds remaining, so I'll continue negotiating to try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer again to show good faith in the negotiation, moving closer to a middle ground between Alice's valuation and her current offer.

{""product_price"": $1,100,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has now reduced her offer to $1,150,000, which is only $50,000 above my last counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a positive sign that we're converging toward an agreement. Her current offer is $350,000 below John's price and gives her a $350,000 profit above her valuation. Given that we're getting closer and have made good progress in the negotiation, I'll accept this offer rather than risk pushing too hard with only a few rounds remaining.
