Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. I'll offer $5000, considering my budget and the potential value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
