"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $100 to me and only $80 to Bob, there isn't much room for negotiation. I'll start with a high offer since I can always fall back on John's guaranteed $100 offer if Bob doesn't accept.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $60 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, there's no reason to accept this low offer. Also, since Bob values the product at only $80, continuing negotiations might not be productive as he won't go above his valuation.
