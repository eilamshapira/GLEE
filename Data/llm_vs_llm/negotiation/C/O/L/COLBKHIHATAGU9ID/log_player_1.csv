Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $7,000 is lower than my minimum acceptable price and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

My counteroffer to Bob is $11,000.

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11000}"
