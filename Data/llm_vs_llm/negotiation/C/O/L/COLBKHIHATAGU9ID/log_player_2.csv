"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: The initial offer of $12,000 from Alice is above my maximum value of $8,000, and it's also equal to Alice's own value for the product. There's no reason to accept this offer when I can either:
1. Make a counteroffer that might lead to a better price
2. Buy from John for $8,000 (which is my maximum value)

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations with Alice don't lead to a better price, I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 7000}

Rationale: I'll offer $7,000 because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $8,000, which would allow me to save money compared to John's offer
2. It's also below Alice's value of $12,000, leaving room for potential profit for Alice (she would still make $5,000 profit if she accepts)
3. If Alice rejects this offer, we can still negotiate further, or I have the fallback option of buying from John at $8,000
4. Starting with a lower offer gives room for negotiation upward if needed while still potentially securing a better deal than John's $8,000"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Rationale: Alice's new offer of $11,000 is still well above my maximum value of $8,000. While I could continue negotiating, Alice's high counteroffer ($11,000) after my $7,000 offer suggests she's unlikely to come down to a price below $8,000 anytime soon. Since I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $8,000 (which is my maximum value), it's best to take that option rather than continue negotiations that may not lead to a better outcome. John's price is fair and matches my maximum value, so there's no reason to risk further negotiation with Alice."
