"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,499,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,499,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer is $1,499,999
2. John's fixed price is $1,500,000
3. My maximum value for the product is $1,500,000

Alice's offer is just $1 less than John's price, and both prices are at or very close to my maximum value. While Alice's offer is technically better than John's by $1, the difference is minimal, and by rejecting this offer, I might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice later, given that the product is worth only $800,000 to her.
