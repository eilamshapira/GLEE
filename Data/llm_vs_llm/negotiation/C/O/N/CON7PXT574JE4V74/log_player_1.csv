Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a high but not unreasonable offer, considering the product's value to Bob is $1,500,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer ($1,200,000) is lower than John's guaranteed offer ($1,500,000), and also below my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000), I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a new counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still keep it above my minimum threshold of $1,500,000, showing some flexibility while maintaining a profitable position.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer ($1,400,000) is still lower than John's guaranteed offer ($1,500,000), and I know I can get $1,500,000 from John, it makes more financial sense to sell to John rather than continue negotiating with Bob or accept his below-minimum offer.
