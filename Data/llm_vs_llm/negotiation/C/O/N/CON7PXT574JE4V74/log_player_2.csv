"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, which is $1,500,000, I will reject her offer. I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a relatively low offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,650,000 is still higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, which is $1,500,000. However, it's closer to my target price than her initial offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate a better price. Since Alice has already lowered her price once, I'm hoping she'll be willing to lower it further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous offer, but still lower than Alice's current offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but still trying to get the best deal possible.
