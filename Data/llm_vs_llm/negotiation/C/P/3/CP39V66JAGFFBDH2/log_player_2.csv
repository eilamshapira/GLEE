"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional asset. Given its unique qualities and potential, I'm confident it will be a valuable addition for you. My asking price is $1200000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the price Alice is offering ($1,200,000) is higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,000,000), it makes sense to explore other options that fit within my budget.

Given that John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000, which is within my budget and actually the maximum I'm willing to pay, I would choose to buy the product from John instead of accepting Alice's higher offer or risking further negotiation.
