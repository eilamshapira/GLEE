"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $16,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's alternative price ($12,000). It would be logical to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice than the $12,000 alternative from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 10000}

I'll make a counteroffer of $10,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation because:

1. It's below my maximum value of $12,000
2. It's below John's price of $12,000
3. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, there's still room for her to make a profit
4. It leaves room for negotiation to move upward while still potentially getting a better deal than John's price

This offer gives me the opportunity to negotiate while potentially saving money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has lowered her price from $16,000 to $14,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but $14,000 is still higher than both:
1. My maximum value ($12,000)
2. John's alternative price ($12,000)

There's no reason to accept this offer when I can either:
- Continue negotiating with Alice for a better price
- Buy from John at $12,000 if negotiations don't work out

I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to meet somewhere between my previous offer ($10,000) and the maximum I'm willing to pay ($12,000)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm increasing my offer to $11,000, which is a strategic move because:

1. It shows willingness to negotiate by moving up from my previous offer of $10,000
2. It's still under my maximum value and John's price of $12,000
3. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, she could still make a $1,000 profit
4. If Alice rejects this, I still have the option to either negotiate further or go with John's offer
5. This leaves room for one more potential increase in my offer while still staying under $12,000

This is a reasonable compromise that might help us reach an agreement, while still potentially saving money compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John because:

1. Alice's offer ($12,500) is still above both:
   - My maximum value ($12,000)
   - John's guaranteed price ($12,000)

2. While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate down (from $16,000 to $14,000 to $12,500), she's still asking for more than John's price.

3. Even though we could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will go below $12,000, and we've already used half of our available rounds.

4. John's offer of $12,000 is a sure thing and matches my maximum value.

It's most rational to take John's guaranteed offer of $12,000 rather than risk further negotiations or pay more than necessary with Alice."
