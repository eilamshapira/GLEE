Send your offer to Bob.,"Considering the situation, I need to make a strategic offer that maximizes my revenue while ensuring Bob is likely to accept.

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and I have a guaranteed fallback option of selling to John for $1,000,000 if Bob rejects.

Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, I'll offer it at a price that gives him some incentive to purchase while capturing most of the additional value. I'll set the price at $1,150,000, which:
- Is below Bob's valuation of $1,200,000, giving him $50,000 in surplus value
- Is $150,000 higher than my guaranteed alternative with John
- Creates a win-win situation where both parties benefit from the transaction
