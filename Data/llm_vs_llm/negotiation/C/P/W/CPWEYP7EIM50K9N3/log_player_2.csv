"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to consider the offer carefully. 

Alice is offering the product for $100, which exceeds the maximum value of $80 that the product is worth to me. 

Since I know I can buy the product from John for exactly $80 (which matches my maximum value), there's no reason to accept Alice's higher price of $100.

I could reject and make a counteroffer to Alice, but since I already have a guaranteed option to buy at my maximum valuation ($80), there's no need to continue negotiating with Alice unless I believe she would accept a price significantly below $80.

The most rational decision is to buy from John at $80.
