"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000. I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and constraints.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest. However, I believe the value of the product is higher. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $1200000. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you believe the product's value is higher, but $1200000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $950000? I think this is a reasonable compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
