,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product.",60.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer, but $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $180 for the product. Let me know what you think!",180.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the lowest I can go is $170 for the product. It's a great deal considering its value. What do you say?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $170 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I can pay $65 for the product, but I can stretch up to $70 if that's acceptable to you.",70.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $70 is still below my minimum. I can come down to $160 for the product. Let me know if that works for you!",160.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I need to stick to my minimum value. I can offer the product for $155. This is the best I can do. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to lower the price. However, $155 is still above my budget. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to make a serious compromise. I can offer $75 for the product, which is the highest I'm comfortable paying.",75.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $75 is still too low for me. I can go as low as $152 for the product. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if you can meet this price!",152.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. My final offer before considering other options is $151 for the product. Can you meet this price?",151.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the slight reduction, but $151 is still too high for me. I've already stretched my budget to $75, and I'm not comfortable going much higher. I can offer $78, which is the absolute highest I'm willing to pay. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",78.0,Bob,8,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but $78 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to sell the product for $150, which is the lowest I can go. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider selling to another buyer. Let me know your decision!",150.0,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I've gone as low as I can with $150. This is my final offer. If you can't meet this price, I'll have to sell the product to another buyer. Please let me know your decision!",150.0,Alice,9,
