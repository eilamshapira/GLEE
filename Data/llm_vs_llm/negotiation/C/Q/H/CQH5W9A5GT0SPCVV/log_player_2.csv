"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to analyze this situation carefully. 

Alice has offered me the product for $150, which is exactly the maximum value it's worth to me. The alternative is to buy from John also at $150.

Since both options are at the same price ($150), there's no advantage to buying from John. However, by rejecting Alice's offer, I can make a counteroffer that might save me some money.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives us room to negotiate.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has now offered me the product for $130, which is a $20 discount from both her original offer and John's price of $150. This is already a good improvement and saves me money. However, I could try to negotiate further to see if I can get an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $150 to $130, showing willingness to negotiate, I'll increase my previous offer while still trying to get a good deal.
