"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, considering I can also buy it from John for $100.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $80 is below my minimum acceptable price. Given that you mentioned John's price of $100, I can offer you the product for $120, which is still a better value considering its quality.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $80 was too low, but $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $90, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and closer to John's price of $100.",90.0,Bob,4,
