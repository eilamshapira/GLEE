Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a great product that I believe would be perfect for you. I'm offering it at $150, which I think is a fair price considering its quality and value."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, considering I can also buy it from John for $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $80 is below my minimum acceptable price. Given that you mentioned John's price of $100, I can offer you the product for $120, which is still a better value considering its quality."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $80 was too low, but $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $90, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and closer to John's price of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

The negotiation with Bob isn't progressing towards a price above $100, which is my minimum acceptable price. Since Bob seems unwilling to match or exceed John's offer of $100, and considering we've already gone through 4 rounds with Bob only offering $90, it makes more sense to take John's guaranteed offer of $100."
