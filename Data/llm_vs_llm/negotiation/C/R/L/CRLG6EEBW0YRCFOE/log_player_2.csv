"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's offer of $11,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative price ($8,000), it wouldn't be rational to accept this offer. Additionally, since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value, and any counteroffer to Alice would likely result in a price above $8,000 (given her high initial offer and that the product is worth $12,000 to her), the best decision would be to buy from John.
