"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While $10000 is less than what John is charging, I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. The product is valued at around $8000 in similar markets, and I'm prepared to offer you $8500 for it. This gives you a $500 profit margin while allowing me to save significantly compared to John's price. Would you accept this offer?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, considering the product's quality and market position, I'm firm on a price of $9500. I believe this reflects fair value for both sides. Let me know if you're on board with this price.",9500.0,Alice,3,
