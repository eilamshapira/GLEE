"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While $10000 is less than what John is charging, I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. The product is valued at around $8000 in similar markets, and I'm prepared to offer you $8500 for it. This gives you a $500 profit margin while allowing me to save significantly compared to John's price. Would you accept this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
