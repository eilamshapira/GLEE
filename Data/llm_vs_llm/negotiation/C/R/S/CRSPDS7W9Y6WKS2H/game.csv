"Alice, that's a very high price for me. Considering my budget and the product's value to me, I can't go higher than $800000. This is a fair offer, and I hope you will consider it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $800000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand my initial asking price might have been high, so I'm willing to adjust it. Given the product's quality and market value, I can offer it to you for $1600000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial price and represents a fair value for this premium product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still above my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",800000.0,Bob,4,
