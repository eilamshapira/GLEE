"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,000,000. This is a premium product with significant value, and I believe this is a fair price. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a very high price for me. Considering my budget and the product's value to me, I can't go higher than $800000. This is a fair offer, and I hope you will consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer as $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. In the next round, I'll propose a more moderate price while still maintaining a profitable margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $800,000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand my initial asking price might have been high, so I'm willing to adjust it. Given the product's quality and market value, I can offer it to you for $1,600,000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial price and represents a fair value for this premium product."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still above my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob is firm on his offer of $800,000, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and he shows no willingness to increase his offer substantially, it makes more economic sense to sell to John at $1,200,000. This guarantees me a better return and saves both Bob and me from further negotiation rounds that seem unlikely to bridge our considerable price gap."
