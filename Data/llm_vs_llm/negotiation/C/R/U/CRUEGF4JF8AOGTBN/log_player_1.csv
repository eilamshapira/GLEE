Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that:
1. The product is worth $120 minimum to me
2. The product is worth $80 to Bob
3. I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120
4. Bob will reject any offer above what the product is worth to him ($80)

It makes the most sense to sell to John for $120, as any price acceptable to Bob (â‰¤$80) would result in a loss for me since the product is worth $120 to me.
