"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you. It's a high-quality item that I'm currently selling for $150. However, I value our potential business relationship and would like to offer it to you at $120, which is my absolute minimum price point as I have another buyer, John, ready to purchase at this price. This represents a fair deal given the product's value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
