"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Based on the information provided, I'm comparing the offer from Alice ($2,000,000) with my maximum valuation ($800,000) and John's alternative offer ($800,000).

Since Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation and John's price, the rational choice is to buy from John.
