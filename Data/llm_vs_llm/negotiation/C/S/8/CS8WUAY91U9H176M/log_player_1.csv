Send your offer to Bob.,"Given the scenario:
- I know Bob values the product at $8,000
- I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000
- The product is worth at least $10,000 to me

Since Bob values the product at $8,000, any offer above that amount will be rejected, and I would then sell to John for $10,000. If I offer $8,000 or less, Bob might accept, but that would give me less money than selling to John.

Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to make an offer that Bob will reject, so I can sell to John for $10,000.
