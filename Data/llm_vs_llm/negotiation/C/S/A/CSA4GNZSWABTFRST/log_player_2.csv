"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'll really like. Considering your interest in this, I'm offering it to you for a special price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. Alice is offering the product for $140
3. John's price is $150
4. Alice's price ($140) is $10 less than John's price ($150)

Since Alice's offer of $140 is below my maximum value ($150) and is less than John's price, it makes economic sense to accept Alice's offer. While I would have preferred an even lower price (knowing the product is worth $100 to Alice), $140 is still better than paying $150 to John.
