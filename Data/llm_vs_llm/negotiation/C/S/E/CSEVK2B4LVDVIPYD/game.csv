"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $15000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my research and budget constraints, I can offer $5000. This is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. If we can't reach an agreement, I do have another seller willing to provide the same product at a competitive price.",5000.0,Bob,2,
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5000 is unfortunately far below what I'm willing to accept.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $12000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested in continuing the negotiation at this price.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $5000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $12000. This price is still competitive and gives you a significant advantage.  Let's reach a deal. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,
