"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $15000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my research and budget constraints, I can offer $5000. This is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. If we can't reach an agreement, I do have another seller willing to provide the same product at a competitive price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
