"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given the information provided, I need to make a decision based on my goal to buy the product while saving as much money as possible.

Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is significantly higher than the $8,000 that the product is worth to me. Additionally, I know I have the option to buy the same product from John for $8,000.

Since Alice's offer exceeds both the product's value to me and the alternative option available, the most rational choice is to reject Alice's offer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $15,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my research and budget constraints, I can offer $5,000. This is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. If we can't reach an agreement, I do have another seller willing to provide the same product at a competitive price."", ""product_price"": 5000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $5000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $12000. This price is still competitive and gives you a significant advantage.  Let's reach a deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given the updated information, I need to make a decision based on my goal to buy the product while saving as much money as possible.

Alice has reduced her offer to $12,000, which shows some willingness to negotiate. However, this price is still significantly higher than the $8,000 that John is offering for the same product.

Since my goal is to save as much money as possible while obtaining the product, and John's offer of $8,000 is already at my maximum valuation for the product, the most rational choice is to buy from John.
