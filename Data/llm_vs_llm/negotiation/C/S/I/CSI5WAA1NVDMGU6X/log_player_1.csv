Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $800,000 as it's significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and John's guaranteed offer ($1,200,000). There's no reason to accept less than what John is offering.

Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, and Bob's offer is well below this, I'll sell to John rather than continue negotiations with Bob, who started with a very low counteroffer.
