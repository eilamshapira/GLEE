"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its market value and unique features, I'm offering it at $1500000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is higher than the product's value to me ($1,200,000) and higher than John's guaranteed price ($1,200,000). Since I wouldn't save any money by accepting this offer, and it actually exceeds my maximum valuation, I should either reject or buy from John directly.

Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum valuation ($1,200,000), and Alice's initial offer is significantly higher, it makes sense to just buy from John immediately rather than going through a potentially lengthy negotiation process.
