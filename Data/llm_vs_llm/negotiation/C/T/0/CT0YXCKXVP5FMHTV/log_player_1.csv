Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. Since I know I can get $150 from John as a guaranteed backup option, I should offer Bob a higher price to maximize my potential profit. While I don't want to price it so high that Bob will definitely reject it, I also don't want to leave money on the table. A reasonable markup would be to offer it at $225, which is 50% above my minimum acceptable price.
