(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go lower to make a sale. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to budge.  This offer is still profitable for Alice but leaves me with substantial savings if accepted."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

**Reasoning:** Alice reducing her price by $100,000 shows she's willing to negotiate. However, there's still a gap between her offer and my ideal price. I'll counteroffer again to try and close that gap."

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price significantly below her current offer. This keeps the negotiation moving while still seeking a good deal."
