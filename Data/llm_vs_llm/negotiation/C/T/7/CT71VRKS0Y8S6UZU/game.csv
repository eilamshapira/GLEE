"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to do business, $1700000 is much higher than what I can justify for this product. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I can purchase it from another seller at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product, which saves me some money compared to my alternative while still providing you with a sale. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
