"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the product at a competitive price. Considering its value, I'm offering it to you for $1,700,000. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to do business, $1700000 is much higher than what I can justify for this product. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I can purchase it from another seller at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product, which saves me some money compared to my alternative while still providing you with a sale. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
