(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's offer of $1,700,000 is significantly higher than the product's worth to me ($1,000,000) and also higher than John's price of $1,000,000. There's no reason to accept this offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to do business, $1,700,000 is much higher than what I can justify for this product. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and I can purchase it from another seller at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product, which saves me some money compared to my alternative while still providing you with a sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
