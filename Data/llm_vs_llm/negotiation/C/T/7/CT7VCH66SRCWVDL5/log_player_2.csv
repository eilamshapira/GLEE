"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is offering it for $150, which is significantly higher than my maximum value. John is offering the same product for $100, but before going to John, I should try to negotiate with Alice to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's below my maximum value but leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is too high for me. I know the market value of this product, and I'm willing to pay $85 for it."", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after considering your perspective, I'm willing to lower my price to $120. This is a fair price for the value you'll be getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has reduced her price from $150 to $120, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $120 is still above both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). Since I can get it from John for $100, there's no reason to accept a higher price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's option.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $150 to $120, showing willingness to negotiate, I'll increase my previous offer slightly but still keep it attractive for me.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, I can actually get this product elsewhere for $100. To make it worth buying from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer $90."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I want to close this deal as much as you do. I am willing to match the market value and set the price at $105. This way, both of us can walk away from this negotiation happy and satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has now offered $105, which is very close to John's price of $100. However, since I can still get the exact same product from John for $100, and that price is already at my maximum value threshold, there's no reason for me to pay $5 more. At this point, it makes the most economic sense to buy from John.
