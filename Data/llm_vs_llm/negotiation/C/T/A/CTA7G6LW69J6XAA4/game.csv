"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's quality and potential benefits it can bring to you.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $10000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $18000, considering the product's exceptional quality and the value it can bring to you. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe $18000 is a more reasonable price.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $18000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $11000. This is the maximum I can go while staying within my budget. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I can do $14500, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet halfway, but $14500 is still outside my budget. I can go up to $11500, which is my final offer before I consider other options. Let me know if this works for you.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're reaching the limit of your budget, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not comfortable with $11500. Considering your constraints, I'm willing to make a final concession. I can do $13000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options.",13000.0,Alice,7,
