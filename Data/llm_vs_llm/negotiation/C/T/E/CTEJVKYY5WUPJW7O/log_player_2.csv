"Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Looking at the options, Alice's offer is to sell the product for $999,999, which is very close to her value of $1,000,000. However, this price exceeds the maximum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me (Bob).

The third option allows me to buy the product from John for $800,000, which equals exactly the maximum value I place on the product. This means I would be getting the product at a price that doesn't exceed its worth to me.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, the best choice is to buy from John.
