"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $10000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. While I understand budget constraints, the product's value is significantly higher. I can reduce my initial asking price to $13500, which is a substantial reduction from my first offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still providing you with a fair deal. Would you consider this revised offer?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I can go up to $11000. This is the maximum I can offer while staying within my budget. Let me know if this works for you.",11000.0,Bob,4,
