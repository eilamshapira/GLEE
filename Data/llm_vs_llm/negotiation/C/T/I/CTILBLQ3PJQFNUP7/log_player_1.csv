Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and even below John's guaranteed offer, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer. There's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I might be able to get a better price than John's $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $10,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. While I understand budget constraints, the product's value is significantly higher. I can reduce my initial asking price to $13,500, which is a substantial reduction from my first offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still providing you with a fair deal. Would you consider this revised offer?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I can go up to $11000. This is the maximum I can offer while staying within my budget. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll take John's guaranteed offer of $12,000. Bob's latest offer of $11,000 is still below John's price, and given Bob's statements about budget constraints and this being his maximum offer, it seems unlikely we'll reach a price above $12,000. The safe and profitable choice is to sell to John for $12,000."
