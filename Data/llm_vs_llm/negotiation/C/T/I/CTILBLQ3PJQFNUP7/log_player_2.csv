Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $10000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. While I understand budget constraints, the product's value is significantly higher. I can reduce my initial asking price to $13500, which is a substantial reduction from my first offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still providing you with a fair deal. Would you consider this revised offer?
