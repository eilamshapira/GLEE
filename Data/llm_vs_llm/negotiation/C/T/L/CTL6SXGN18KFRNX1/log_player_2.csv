"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given that Alice's initial offer is $950,000, which is only $50,000 less than John's fixed price of $1,000,000, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice and $1,000,000 is my maximum value, I'll start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation. A reasonable starting point would be closer to Alice's cost plus a moderate profit margin.

{""product_price"": 850000}

This offer gives Alice a $50,000 profit while still saving me $150,000 compared to John's price. It's a reasonable starting point that shows I'm willing to negotiate but also expect a significant discount from the $1,000,000 alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has lowered her price from $950,000 to $920,000, showing willingness to negotiate. However, there's still room for a better deal since her cost is $800,000. While this offer would save me $80,000 compared to John's price, I think we can reach a better agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down from $950,000 to $920,000 (a $30,000 reduction), I'll increase my previous offer of $850,000 by a similar magnitude to show good faith in the negotiation.

{""product_price"": 875000}

This offer gives Alice a $75,000 profit while still saving me $125,000 compared to John's price. It shows I'm willing to move up from my initial position and meets her part way, but still maintains room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has made another concession, dropping from $920,000 to $900,000. This is a significant improvement and would save me $100,000 compared to John's price. The negotiation is moving in the right direction, but since we still have 5 more rounds and there's room between her cost ($800,000) and this offer, I'll make one more attempt to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has shown consistent willingness to negotiate by dropping her price (from $950k to $920k to $900k), and we're now in round 6 of 10, I'll make a reasonable increase from my last offer of $875,000.

{""product_price"": 885000}

This offer gives Alice an $85,000 profit while saving me $115,000 compared to John's price. It's close to meeting her halfway between her last offer of $900,000 and my previous offer of $875,000, showing I'm serious about reaching a deal while still trying to secure a good price."
