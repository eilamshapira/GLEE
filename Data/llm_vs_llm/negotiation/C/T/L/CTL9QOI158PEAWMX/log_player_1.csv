Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to set a price that will maximize my earnings, considering that Bob values the product at $15,000, and I have a fallback option of selling to John for $8,000.

If Bob rejects my offer, I'll get $8,000 from John. So I need to offer Bob a price that he'll accept while giving me more than $8,000.

Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, he should theoretically be willing to pay up to that amount. However, offering exactly $15,000 would leave him with no benefit, so he might reject it. I should offer a price that gives Bob some value while significantly improving my position compared to my fallback option.

I'll offer a price that splits the difference between my minimum ($8,000) and Bob's maximum value ($15,000), but leaning more toward Bob's maximum since I have the negotiating power of making the offer:

{""product_price"": 13500}"
