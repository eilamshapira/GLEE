"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
While $13,500 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than buying from John for $15,000. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better price, and she might come back with a lower offer."
