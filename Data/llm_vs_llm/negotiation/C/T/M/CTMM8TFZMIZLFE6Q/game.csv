"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I believe this price reflects a fair value for the product, considering its market worth and the benefits it will provide. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this proposal.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $8500, I need to get closer to my target price. This product delivers exceptional value and quality. I'm willing to come down to $9800, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price still provides you with excellent value considering the $12000 worth of benefits you'll receive from this product. What do you think?",9800.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $9800. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'd like to propose a price of $8700. This price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",8700.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your new offer. While $8700 is moving in the right direction, I'm still quite a bit away from what I need for this product. Let me meet you closer to the middle at $9300. This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and is quite reasonable considering the $12000 value you'll get from this product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",9300.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, and I appreciate that. However, $9300 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I'd like to propose a price of $8900. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",8900.0,Bob,6,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the increase in your offer. I can see we're getting closer to finding common ground. After careful consideration, I can offer you the product at $9100. This represents my best price and is a substantial reduction from where we started. Given that the product will deliver $12000 in value to you, this still provides you with an excellent return on investment. We've been negotiating in good faith, and I believe this price represents a fair compromise for both of us. I hope we can finalize our deal at this price.",9100.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort you're putting into finding a mutually beneficial price. However, $9100 is still slightly above what I'm willing to pay. Considering we're close to reaching an agreement, I'd like to propose a price of $9000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price, as I'm eager to move forward with the purchase.",9000.0,Bob,8,
