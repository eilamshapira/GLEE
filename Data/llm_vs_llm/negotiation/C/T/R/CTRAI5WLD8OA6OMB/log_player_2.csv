"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! Considering its value and the limited availability, I'm offering it to you for $18000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","The offer from Alice is for $18,000, which is actually higher than the product's worth to me ($10,000). It's also higher than John's offer of $10,000.

There's no reason to accept this offer from Alice when I can purchase the same product from John at a much lower price that matches its value to me.
