"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer ($200) is higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100), it makes no economic sense to accept Alice's offer. John's price equals my maximum value, and it's a guaranteed option.
