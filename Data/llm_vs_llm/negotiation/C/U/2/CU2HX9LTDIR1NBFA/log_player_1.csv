"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $120. Would you be willing to consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since Bob seems interested in negotiating. The fact that he started with $120 suggests there might be room to negotiate a higher price that would be more profitable than selling to John at $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $120 is lower than what I can accept given the product's value. I can come down to $160, which I believe is a fair price considering the quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand that $120 was too low, but I'm still interested in the product. I'd like to propose a new counteroffer of $140. Would you be willing to accept it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $140. This is $20 more than what John is offering ($120), and given that we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, it's a reasonable compromise that ensures a better profit than my alternative option."
