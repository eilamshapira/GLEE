"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in making this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer of $180 is above my budget of $150, I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and within my budget. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a lower price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $120. Would you be willing to consider it?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $120 is lower than what I can accept given the product's value. I can come down to $160, which I believe is a fair price considering the quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $160 is still above my budget of $150. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $150, I don't see a reason to accept Alice's offer. I'll reject it again and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to meet Alice halfway between my previous offer and her new offer. Since she came down to $160, I'll increase my offer to $140, which is still within my budget of $150.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand that $120 was too low, but I'm still interested in the product. I'd like to propose a new counteroffer of $140. Would you be willing to accept it?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
