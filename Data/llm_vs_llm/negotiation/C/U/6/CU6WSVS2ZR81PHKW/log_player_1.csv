Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $120 is a bit high for me. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $100, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $80? This would be a win-win situation, as I'd save some money and you'd make a sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
