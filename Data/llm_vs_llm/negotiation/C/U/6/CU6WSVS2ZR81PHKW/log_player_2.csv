"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
2. John is offering the same product for $100
3. Alice's offer is $120, which is above both my maximum value and John's price

The logical choice is to:
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: Alice's price ($120) is above both my maximum valuation ($100) and John's alternative offer ($100). It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer below $100, as I can always fall back on John's $100 offer if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $120 is a bit high for me. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $100, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $80? This would be a win-win situation, as I'd save some money and you'd make a sale."", ""product_price"": 80}"
