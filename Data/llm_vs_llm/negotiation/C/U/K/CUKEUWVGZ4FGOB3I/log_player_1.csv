(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm also running out of rounds. Let's assess the situation.

*   **Current Offer:** $1,100,000
*   **My Minimum:** $1,200,000
*   **John's Offer:** $1,200,000
*   **Rounds Remaining:** 2

I could try to get Bob to go higher, but I risk losing the deal entirely and ending up with nothing. Selling to John is guaranteed money. Considering the risk, I believe selling to John is the best choice.
