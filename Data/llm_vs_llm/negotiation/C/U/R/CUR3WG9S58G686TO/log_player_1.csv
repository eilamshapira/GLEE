"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation. I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, which gives me a baseline for my negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum threshold. I'll proceed to the next round and try to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $9,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price that's closer to my desired value while still showing flexibility."
