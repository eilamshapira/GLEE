"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'll reject Alice's offer of $11,000 since it's actually higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's alternative price ($10,000). There's no reason to accept a price higher than what John is offering.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice and I want to save money, I'll start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation. I'll offer $8,500, which gives room for negotiation while still being a reasonable starting point.

{""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's offer of $9,500 is a good price - it's below both my maximum value and John's price of $10,000. Since there's a risk that Alice might increase the price if I try to negotiate further, and her current offer already saves me $500 compared to John's price, I'll accept this offer.
