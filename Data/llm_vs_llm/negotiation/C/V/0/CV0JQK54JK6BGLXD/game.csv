"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $800000, I must point out that this is below my minimum acceptable price. The product has a value of at least $1000000 to me, which is also what another buyer, John, is willing to pay. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can offer you the product for $1200000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. This represents excellent value considering the product's quality and potential.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1200000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1000000? That seems like a fair price considering John is offering you the same amount.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
