While I appreciate your offer of $800,000, I must point out that this is below my minimum acceptable price. The product has a value of at least $1,000,000 to me, which is also what another buyer, John, is willing to pay. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can offer you the product for $1,200,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price.

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1200000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1000000? That seems like a fair price considering John is offering you the same amount.
