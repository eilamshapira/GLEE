Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $800000, I must point out that this is below my minimum acceptable price. The product has a value of at least $1000000 to me, which is also what another buyer, John, is willing to pay. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can offer you the product for $1200000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. This represents excellent value considering the product's quality and potential.
