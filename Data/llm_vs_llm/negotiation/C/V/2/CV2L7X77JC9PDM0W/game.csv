"Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $25000. This is a competitive price for what you're getting. Would you be interested?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $25000 is way beyond my budget for this product. Based on my valuation, I can only offer $9000. Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand my initial offer might have been high, so I'm willing to come down to $21000. This is a substantial reduction that better reflects the product's true market value while still accounting for its quality and features. Would you consider this revised offer?",21000.0,Alice,3,
"Hi Alice, thanks for your revised offer. I understand $21000 might be closer to your valuation, but unfortunately, that number is still far outside my budget. I'm willing to stretch a bit compared to my earlier offerâ€”my best is $11000. Please let me know if that can work for you.",11000.0,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but my budget is really tight. I can stretch up to $11500 for this product. If that works for you, I'd be happy to finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to consider my alternative option.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $11500, and I understand budget constraints. However, I need to be transparent - I have another buyer offering $15000. Given this, I can lower my price to $18000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Would you be able to meet me closer to this range?",18000.0,Alice,5,
