"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $25,000. This is a competitive price for what you're getting. Would you be interested?"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $25000 is way beyond my budget for this product. Based on my valuation, I can only offer $9000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $9,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 (which I can get from John). I want to continue negotiating with Bob as there might be potential to get a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand my initial offer might have been high, so I'm willing to come down to $21,000. This is a substantial reduction that better reflects the product's true market value while still accounting for its quality and features. Would you consider this revised offer?"", ""product_price"": 21000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but my budget is really tight. I can stretch up to $11500 for this product. If that works for you, I'd be happy to finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to consider my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer since $11,500 is still below what I can get from John ($15,000). While Bob is showing some flexibility by increasing his offer, the gap is still too large. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $11,500, and I understand budget constraints. However, I need to be transparent - I have another buyer offering $15,000. Given this, I can lower my price to $18,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Would you be able to meet me closer to this range?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
