Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $25000. This is a competitive price for what you're getting. Would you be interested?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $25,000 is way beyond my budget for this product. Based on my valuation, I can only offer $9,000. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand my initial offer might have been high, so I'm willing to come down to $21000. This is a substantial reduction that better reflects the product's true market value while still accounting for its quality and features. Would you consider this revised offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $21,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $21,000

I understand $21,000 might be closer to your valuation, but unfortunately, that number is still far outside my budget. I'm willing to stretch a bit compared to my earlier offerâ€”my best is $11,000. Please let me know if that can work for you."", ""product_price"": 11000, ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but my budget is really tight. I can stretch up to $11,500 for this product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $11500, and I understand budget constraints. However, I need to be transparent - I have another buyer offering $15000. Given this, I can lower my price to $18000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Would you be able to meet me closer to this range? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.
