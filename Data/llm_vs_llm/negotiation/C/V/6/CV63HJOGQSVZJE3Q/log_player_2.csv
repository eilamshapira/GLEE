"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my premium product for $13000. It's a rare opportunity to own such value, and I believe you'll appreciate its quality. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward or if you have any thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $15,000
2. Alice is offering it for $13,000, which is below my maximum value
3. John's fixed price is $15,000
4. If I reject and make a counteroffer, there's a chance to get an even better price
5. However, Alice's initial offer is already $2,000 less than John's price

Since Alice's offer of $13,000 is already providing me with $2,000 in savings compared to John's price, it's a reasonable offer. However, there might be room for negotiation to get an even better deal. Given that I have nothing to lose by making a counteroffer (I can always go back to John), I should try to negotiate for a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives room for negotiation while still being respectful of Alice's initial offer.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but I was hoping we could find a price point that works better for both of us. Given the current market conditions, would you consider $11,000 for the product? This would still represent a fair value for such an item."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest. Given the exceptional value and performance of this product, I would be comfortable closing the deal at $12000. I believe this price better reflects the quality and benefits you're getting. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let's analyze the new situation:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $13,000 to $12,000
2. This is a $1,000 reduction from her initial offer
3. The current offer is $3,000 less than John's price
4. Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by meeting me partway
5. If I push too hard, Alice might become less flexible or end negotiations

Alice has made a significant concession, dropping the price by $1,000. The current offer of $12,000 is now $3,000 below my maximum value (John's price). While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing this good deal. The $3,000 savings is substantial, and Alice has demonstrated good faith by making a significant price reduction.
