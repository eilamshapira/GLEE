"Hello Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you. This high-quality item is worth $200 in the market, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price of $180. This is an excellent opportunity as the product has many great features and benefits.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you do it for $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $110. The product actually costs me $150, so I can't sell below that price. However, I can offer it to you for $165, which is still a good discount from my initial offer. This is a quality product that will serve you well.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $165 is still beyond what I'm comfortable spending. I could potentially go up to $120, but that's really my limit.  What do you say?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but I simply cannot go below $150 for this product - that's my absolute bottom line as it represents my cost. At this price point, I'm essentially breaking even. I understand if this exceeds your budget, but I hope you can see this is the fairest price I can offer.",150.0,Alice,5,
