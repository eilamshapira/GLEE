"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you. This high-quality item is worth $200 in the market, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price of $180. This is an excellent opportunity as the product has many great features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you do it for $110?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $110. The product actually costs me $150, so I can't sell below that price. However, I can offer it to you for $165, which is still a good discount from my initial offer. This is a quality product that will serve you well. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is still way above my budget. I'll try to bring her down further, but I'm keeping John in mind if this doesn't improve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $165 is still beyond what I'm comfortable spending. I could potentially go up to $120, but that's really my limit.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but I simply cannot go below $150 for this product - that's my absolute bottom line as it represents my cost. At this price point, I'm essentially breaking even. I understand if this exceeds your budget, but I hope you can see this is the fairest price I can offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice won't budge below $150.  It's not worth my time to haggle further when I can get it for $100 from John."
