Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer Bob. I know the following:

1. The product is worth at least $15,000 to me
2. The product is worth $10,000 to Bob
3. If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell to John for $15,000

Since Bob values the product at $10,000, he won't accept any offer above that amount. Since I can sell to John for $15,000, there's no incentive for me to offer Bob a price below $15,000.

Given these constraints, it makes the most sense to sell to John for $15,000 rather than trying to make a deal with Bob that would result in less money for me.
