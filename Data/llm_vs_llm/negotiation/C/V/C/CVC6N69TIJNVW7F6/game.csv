"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $18500. This is a quality product, and I'm confident it will serve your needs well.",18500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8000, considering the product's value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I can't accept $8000 as it's significantly below my product's value. My cost basis is $15000, so I can't go below that price. I can offer it to you for $16500, which is already a reduction from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering the quality and value of the product.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $8000 was a low offer, and I appreciate you coming down to $16500. However, I still think there's room for negotiation. Considering my budget and the product's value to me, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10500. This is a serious offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer of $10500, which shows your serious interest in the product. However, I need to be transparent - the product is worth no less than $15000 to me, which is my absolute minimum. I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at $15000, but I'm giving you the opportunity first. I can come down to $15500 as my final offer, which is just slightly above my minimum threshold. This is as low as I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me.",15500.0,Alice,5,
