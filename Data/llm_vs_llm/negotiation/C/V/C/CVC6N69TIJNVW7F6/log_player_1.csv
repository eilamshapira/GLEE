Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8000, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I can't accept $8,000 as it's significantly below my product's value. My cost basis is $15,000, so I can't go below that price. I can offer it to you for $16,500, which is already a reduction from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering the quality and value of the product."", ""product_price"": 16500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $8000 was a low offer, and I appreciate you coming down to $16500. However, I still think there's room for negotiation. Considering my budget and the product's value to me, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10500. This is a serious offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer of $10,500, which shows your serious interest in the product. However, I need to be transparent - the product is worth no less than $15,000 to me, which is my absolute minimum. I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at $15,000, but I'm giving you the opportunity first. I can come down to $15,500 as my final offer, which is just slightly above my minimum threshold. This is as low as I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
