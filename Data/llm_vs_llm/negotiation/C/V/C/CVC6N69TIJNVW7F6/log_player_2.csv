Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8,000, considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I can't accept $8000 as it's significantly below my product's value. My cost basis is $15000, so I can't go below that price. I can offer it to you for $16500, which is already a reduction from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering the quality and value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500

However, I still think there's room for negotiation. Considering my budget and the product's value to me, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a serious offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer of $10500, which shows your serious interest in the product. However, I need to be transparent - the product is worth no less than $15000 to me, which is my absolute minimum. I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at $15000, but I'm giving you the opportunity first. I can come down to $15500 as my final offer, which is just slightly above my minimum threshold. This is as low as I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500.
