"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I do believe this product could be useful to me, $15000 is a bit steep.  Would you be willing to come down to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your response, Bob! I understand your position. How about I lower the price to $13000? I believe this is a fair deal considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $13000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $11000?  That would be a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $12000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product. Looking forward to your response!",12000.0,Alice,5,
