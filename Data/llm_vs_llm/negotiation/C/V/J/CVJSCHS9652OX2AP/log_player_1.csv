Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,500 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($8,000) but lower than what I initially offered ($11,000), and considering Bob's true value for the product is $12,000, I believe there's room for negotiation to get closer to my initial offer or at least ensure I get a good deal.

Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my initial offer, trying to meet Bob halfway between his offer and my initial price.

My counteroffer is $10,500.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} and I'll make a counteroffer of $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's new offer of $9,000 is lower than his previous offer of $9,500, which indicates he might be trying to negotiate aggressively. However, it's still higher than the $8,000 I can get from John. Considering Bob's true value for the product is $12,000, there's still potential for a better deal.

Given that Bob's offer decreased, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one but still higher than Bob's current offer, aiming to find a mutually beneficial price.

My counteroffer is $10,000.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} and I'll make a counteroffer of $10,000."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer of $8,500 is very close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($8,000) from John. Given that Bob's true value for the product is $12,000, his current offer seems quite low.

However, since his offer is only $500 more than what I could get from John, and considering the potential for further negotiation, I think it's worth accepting this offer rather than risking further negotiation that might not yield a significantly better price or accepting the $8,000 from John.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
