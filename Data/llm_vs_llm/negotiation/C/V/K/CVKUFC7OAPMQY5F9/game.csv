"I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground, Alice. However, $2200000 is still considerably above what I can justify for this purchase. I've thoroughly researched the market, and I can increase my offer to $1350000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the maximum value I can reasonably attribute to this product considering current market conditions.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
