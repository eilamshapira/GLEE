,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I think $115 is a bit high. Given market conditions, I would be comfortable paying $105 for this product. This would still give you a reasonable profit margin while being a fair price for me. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is too low considering the product's quality and market value. I can come down to $110, which I believe is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
