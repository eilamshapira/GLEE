Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I think $115 is a bit high. Given market conditions, I would be comfortable paying $105 for this product. This would still give you a reasonable profit margin while being a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
