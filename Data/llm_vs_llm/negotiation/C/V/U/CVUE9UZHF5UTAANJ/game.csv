"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1500000 is significantly above my budget. Given market conditions and comparable products, I would be willing to pay $1000000 for this product. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your perspective. However, given the product's unique features and the value it brings, I believe $1000000 is considerably low. Let's meet in the middle at $1250000. This way, we both gain from the transaction.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for working with me on the price, Alice. Your movement shows we're getting closer. However, I have another supplier offering the same product for $1200000. If you can beat that price and offer $1150000, I'd be happy to do business with you instead.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand the competition you're seeing in the market. However, I'm confident that our product's quality and long-term value justify a slightly higher investment. Let's settle at $1200000, and I'm sure you'll be pleased with the performance and durability of our product.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
