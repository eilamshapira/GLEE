"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll find our asking price of $1500000 quite reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer because $1,500,000 is above my maximum value of $1,200,000. It's also higher than John's guaranteed price. I can try to negotiate with Alice for a better price, and if unsuccessful, I still have John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. Given market conditions and comparable products, I would be willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your perspective. However, given the product's unique features and the value it brings, I believe $1000000 is considerably low. Let's meet in the middle at $1250000. This way, we both gain from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer since it's still above John's price of $1,200,000. While Alice has come down significantly, I can try one more negotiation to get a better price. If unsuccessful, I can still fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for working with me on the price, Alice. Your movement shows we're getting closer. However, I have another supplier offering the same product for $1,200,000. If you can beat that price and offer $1,150,000, I'd be happy to do business with you instead."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the competition you're seeing in the market. However, I'm confident that our product's quality and long-term value justify a slightly higher investment. Let's settle at $1200000, and I'm sure you'll be pleased with the performance and durability of our product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's price has now matched John's price at $1,200,000, and she seems unwilling to go lower based on her last message, there's no advantage to continuing negotiations. I might as well take John's offer now as it's the same price and will save time. Also, there's a risk that if I try to negotiate further with Alice, she might increase her price again."
