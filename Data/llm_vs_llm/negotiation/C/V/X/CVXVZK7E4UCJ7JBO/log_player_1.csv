"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting with a competitive price, considering the product's worth to me."", ""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is unique, $3000000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $500000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $500,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $3,000,000 might be out of your budget, but $500,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $2000000 is still quite high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. While $1,250,000 is getting closer to a more acceptable range for me, it's still lower than what I can get from John. I'll try to negotiate further to see if Bob is willing to meet or exceed the $1,500,000 threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. Considering the product's value and the fact that I have another interested buyer, I'd like to propose a price of $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 1750000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but that price is still a little high for me. Would you consider $1400000?  That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows I'm serious about purchasing this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. While $1,400,000 is closer to my target, it's still lower than what I can get from John. Since Bob is showing willingness to increase his offer, I'll try to negotiate further to see if he can meet or exceed the $1,500,000 threshold."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the significant jump in your offer to $1,400,000. It shows you're serious about the product.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob's final offer of $1,450,000 is still lower than what I can get from John ($1,500,000), and I've negotiated extensively with Bob without reaching a mutually agreeable price, I've decided to sell the product to John. This ensures I get a price that meets my minimum requirement."
