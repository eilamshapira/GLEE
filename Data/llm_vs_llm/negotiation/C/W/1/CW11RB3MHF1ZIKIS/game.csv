"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I see the value in the product, but I'm looking to invest in the range of $500000.  Would you be open to negotiating a price closer to that figure?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $500000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to consider a price closer to your range. I'm prepared to accept $1200000 for the product. This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the potential of this product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my range. To be completely transparent, my budget caps out at $800000. I could make that work right now, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the market value.  If this works for you, we can close the deal today. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is still significantly below the value I've placed on this product. To demonstrate my willingness to work with you, I'm prepared to come down to $1000000. This is a fair compromise given the market potential of this product, and it's within your stated budget.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
