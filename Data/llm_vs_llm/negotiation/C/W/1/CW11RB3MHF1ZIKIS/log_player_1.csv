Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I see the value in the product, but I'm looking to invest in the range of $500000.  Would you be open to negotiating a price closer to that figure? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $500,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to consider a price closer to your range.

This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the potential of this product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my range. To be completely transparent, my budget caps out at $800000. I could make that work right now, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the market value.  If this works for you, we can close the deal today. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

$800,000 is still too low.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my previous offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is still significantly below the value I've placed on this product.
