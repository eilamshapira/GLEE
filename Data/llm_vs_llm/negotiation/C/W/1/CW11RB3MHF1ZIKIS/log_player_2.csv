# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a unique product with significant value. My initial asking price is $2000000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point given the product's potential. I'm open to discussing this further and exploring your perspective.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $500000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to consider a price closer to your range. I'm prepared to accept $1200000 for the product. This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the potential of this product.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my range. To be completely transparent, my budget caps out at $800,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is still significantly below the value I've placed on this product. To demonstrate my willingness to work with you, I'm prepared to come down to $1000000. This is a fair compromise given the market potential of this product, and it's within your stated budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

It seems Alice is unlikely to go below $1,000,000.  It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed deal with John for $800,000."
