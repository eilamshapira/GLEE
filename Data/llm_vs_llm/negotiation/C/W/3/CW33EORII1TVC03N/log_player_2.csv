"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since the product is worth $800,000 to me and Alice's offer is $1,000,000, which is higher than its worth to me, I will reject Alice's offer. I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since the product is worth $800,000 to me, I'll offer a price that is slightly lower than that.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $900,000 is still higher than the product's worth to me, which is $800,000. However, it's lower than her initial offer of $1,000,000, so she's moving in the right direction.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate a better price. Since Alice has already come down by $100,000 from her initial offer, I'm hoping she'll be willing to come down further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous offer, but still lower than Alice's current offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and meet Alice halfway.

{""product_price"": $775,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $850,000 is getting closer to the product's worth to me, which is $800,000. However, it's still $50,000 higher than what I'm willing to pay.

At this point, I have to consider the alternative option of buying the product from John for $800,000. Since Alice's offer is only $50,000 higher than John's price, I might as well just buy it from John and save the $50,000.
