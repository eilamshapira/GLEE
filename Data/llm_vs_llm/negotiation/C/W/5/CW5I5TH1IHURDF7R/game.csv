"Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000, considering the market value and my budget. I'm looking forward to your response.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $8000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value and market demand.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18000 is still above my budget.

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $15000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering my previous offers and the fact that I can buy the product from John for $12000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11500. This is my highest offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,6,
