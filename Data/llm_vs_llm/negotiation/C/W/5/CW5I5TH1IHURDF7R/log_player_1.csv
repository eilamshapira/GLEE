Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000, considering the market value and my budget. I'm looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $8,000 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer to see if we can meet at a mutually agreeable price. 

My counteroffer is: $18,000. This is slightly lower than my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still reflects the product's value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000, which I believe is a reasonable price considering the product's value and my needs. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $10,000 because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Although Bob has increased his offer from $8,000 to $10,000, it's not enough to meet my requirements.

My next step is to make another counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us. 

My counteroffer is: $15,000. This price is lower than my previous offer of $18,000, showing that I'm willing to continue negotiating and finding a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $15000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering my previous offers and the fact that I can buy the product from John for $12000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11500. This is my highest offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $11,500 because it's still slightly below the price I can get from John, which is $12,000. Since Bob mentioned that $11,500 is his highest offer, I don't think we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement if I accept this price.

My next step is to make another counteroffer, trying to find a price that works for both of us. 

My counteroffer is: $12,500. This price is higher than Bob's offer, but it's still a compromise from my previous offers. I'm hoping Bob will consider this price and we can reach an agreement.
