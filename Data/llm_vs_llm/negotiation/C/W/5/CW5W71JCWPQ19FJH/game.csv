"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1200000 is a serious offer, I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000, considering the product's exceptional features and value.

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I can see that we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. While $1400000 is a good offer, I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $1600000. This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value and my initial asking price. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
