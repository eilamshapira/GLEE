"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this fantastic product for sale. It's truly a top-of-the-line item. I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable. My initial asking price is $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's starting price is equal to John's offer, there's room for negotiation. It's unlikely Alice would start at her absolute lowest price. By rejecting her initial offer, we can gauge her willingness to go lower and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but it leaves room for further negotiation if she's unwilling to go that low. It also allows us to assess how much lower she might be willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm willing to meet you somewhere in the middle. How about $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is negotiating, which is a good sign. While $135 is closer to our budget, we've still got room to haggle and potentially save even more before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $115? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer splits the difference between her last offer ($135) and our previous counteroffer ($100). It keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price well below John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I can come down to $125, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has signaled that $125 is her bottom line. It's a reasonable price, significantly lower than John's offer, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.  It's a good balance between getting a discount and securing the product."
