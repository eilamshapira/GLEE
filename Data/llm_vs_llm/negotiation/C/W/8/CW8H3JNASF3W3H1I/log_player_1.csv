Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate down from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $8,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counteroffer with $12,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it demonstrates a willingness to compromise while staying above my minimum value."
