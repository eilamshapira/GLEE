"Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm interested in purchasing it. However, your initial price of $18000 is above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs and budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. However, $8000 is significantly below the minimum I can accept. The product's value is substantial, and I'm confident it will deliver a great return for you. How about we meet in the middle a bit? I'd be willing to come down to $16000.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price to $16000. However, it's still above my budget. Considering your last offer and my initial counteroffer, I'd like to propose a compromise at $10000. I believe this price is more reasonable and takes into account the product's value and my budget constraints.",10000.0,Bob,4,
