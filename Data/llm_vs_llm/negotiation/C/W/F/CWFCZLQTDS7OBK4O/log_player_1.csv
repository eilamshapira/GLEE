"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $100 is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I have the option to sell to John for $120, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I will also not sell to John immediately, as I want to try to negotiate a better price with Bob.

My decision is to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I will make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

My counteroffer to Bob is: $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $115 is still lower than my desired price, but closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, I will consider my options carefully.

Accepting Bob's offer would mean selling the product for less than I could get from John, so that's not ideal. Selling to John would guarantee me $120, which is my minimum acceptable price. Making another counteroffer to Bob risks him walking away, but it also gives me a chance to get a better price.

Given that Bob's offer is only $5 less than my minimum acceptable price, and I have the option to sell to John for $120, I will reject Bob's offer and sell the product to John.
