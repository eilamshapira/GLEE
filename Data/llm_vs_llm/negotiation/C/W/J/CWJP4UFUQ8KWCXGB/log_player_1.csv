Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially saving you considerable costs and increasing efficiency. I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000.  This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I don't leave too much money on the table.
* **Value proposition:**  Instead of focusing solely on the price, I highlight the product's benefits, appealing to Bob's potential return on investment. 
* **Urgency:**  The limited-time offer aims to encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without excessive negotiation.
* **Backup plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price to John."
