{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'll really like. I'm offering it to you for $120."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $70. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, I can't accept $70. That's below my minimum. I will make a counteroffer.
