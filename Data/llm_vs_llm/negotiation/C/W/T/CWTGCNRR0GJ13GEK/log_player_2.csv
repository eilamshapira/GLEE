"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Since you have the option to buy the product from John for $8,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $10,000. You can save money by going with John."
