"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Given that:
1. The product is worth $150 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $150
3. John is selling it for $150

All three options result in paying $150 for the product. Since there's no price advantage in any option, and the product is worth exactly what I would pay, I could accept Alice's offer.
