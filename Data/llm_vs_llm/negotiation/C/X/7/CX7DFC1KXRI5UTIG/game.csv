"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, I need to be transparent that your asking price is quite a bit higher than what I'm prepared to pay. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me, which is the same price I can get it from another seller. That said, I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $600000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without the need to find another buyer.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your transparency about the product's value to you. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must reiterate that the product is worth significantly more than $600000 to me. Considering your offer and the fact that you mentioned another seller is willing to sell it to you for $800000, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer the product to you for $900000, which is still below my initial asking price but takes into account your concerns.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be clear that I can get this product from John for $800000, which is already the maximum value this product has for me. I would still prefer to purchase from you if we can reach a fair agreement. My counteroffer is $700000. This is below John's price, which gives me some savings, while still providing you with a sale today rather than having to find another buyer.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your continued efforts to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I understand that $800000 is the maximum value you're willing to pay, and I appreciate your honesty. Considering your latest offer of $700000, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $850000. This price is still below my initial expectations, but it reflects my desire to close the deal with you today. If we can't agree on this price, I will have to consider selling to John for $800000, as it's a guaranteed sale.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate you lowering your price to $850000, Alice. However, I think there might be a misunderstanding - John isn't a buyer, he's another seller who's offering me the same product for $800000. Since $800000 is already the maximum value this product has for me, I can't justify paying more than that. My final offer is $750000, which gives you a sale today while saving me some money compared to John's price. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to go with John's offer of $800000.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Hello Bob, I understand your position and the fact that John is another seller offering the product for $800000. I appreciate your final offer of $750000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering your willingness to pay up to $800000, I'm willing to meet you at that price. I can offer the product to you for $800000, which matches John's price and ensures you get the product from me instead. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Alice,7,
