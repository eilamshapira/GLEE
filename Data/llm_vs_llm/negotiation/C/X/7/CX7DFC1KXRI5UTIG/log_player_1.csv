Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, I need to be transparent that your asking price is quite a bit higher than what I'm prepared to pay. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me, which is the same price I can get it from another seller. That said, I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $600000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without the need to find another buyer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $600,000 because it's significantly lower than my initial offer and I believe the product is worth more. I'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to see if we can meet at a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your transparency about the product's value to you. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must reiterate that the product is worth significantly more than $600,000 to me. Considering your offer and the fact that you mentioned another seller is willing to sell it to you for $800,000, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer the product to you for $900,000, which is still below my initial asking price but takes into account your concerns."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be clear that I can get this product from John for $800000, which is already the maximum value this product has for me. I would still prefer to purchase from you if we can reach a fair agreement. My counteroffer is $700000. This is below John's price, which gives me some savings, while still providing you with a sale today rather than having to find another buyer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $700,000 because it's still below the value I'm willing to accept. Since Bob mentioned that $800,000 is the maximum value the product has for him and that he can get it from John for that price, I believe I can try to meet him closer to that price without going below it. I'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your continued efforts to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I understand that $800,000 is the maximum value you're willing to pay, and I appreciate your honesty. Considering your latest offer of $700,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $850,000. This price is still below my initial expectations, but it reflects my desire to close the deal with you today. If we can't agree on this price, I will have to consider selling to John for $800,000, as it's a guaranteed sale."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering your price to $850000, Alice. However, I think there might be a misunderstanding - John isn't a buyer, he's another seller who's offering me the same product for $800000. Since $800000 is already the maximum value this product has for me, I can't justify paying more than that. My final offer is $750000, which gives you a sale today while saving me some money compared to John's price. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to go with John's offer of $800000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I reject Bob's offer of $750,000 because it's still below the price I'm willing to accept. Since Bob has made it clear that $800,000 is the maximum value he's willing to pay and that he'll go with John's offer if we can't agree, I believe I have a better option. I can sell the product to John for $800,000, which is a guaranteed sale and a higher price than Bob's offer. I don't see a need to continue negotiating with Bob when I have a better alternative.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I understand your position and the fact that John is another seller offering the product for $800,000. I appreciate your final offer of $750,000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering your willingness to pay up to $800,000, I'm willing to meet you at that price. I can offer the product to you for $800,000, which matches John's price and ensures you get the product from me instead.
