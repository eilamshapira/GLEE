"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $1,200,000, I can see that this is significantly higher than the $800,000 maximum value the product is worth to me. It's also $400,000 more than John's guaranteed price of $800,000.

Since this is just the first round of negotiation, and we have up to 10 rounds total, it makes sense to reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer. There's no need to immediately buy from John since we have room to negotiate with Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, I need to be transparent that your asking price is quite a bit higher than what I'm prepared to pay. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, which is the same price I can get it from another seller. That said, I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $600,000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without the need to find another buyer."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your transparency about the product's value to you. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must reiterate that the product is worth significantly more than $600000 to me. Considering your offer and the fact that you mentioned another seller is willing to sell it to you for $800000, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer the product to you for $900000, which is still below my initial asking price but takes into account your concerns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has lowered her price from $1,200,000 to $900,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still higher than the $800,000 maximum value the product is worth to me, and it's also higher than John's guaranteed price of $800,000.

Since John is offering the product for $800,000, and that's the maximum value the product has to me anyway, there's no reason to pay more than $800,000. I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer, but if Alice won't go below $800,000, I'll ultimately buy from John.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be clear that I can get this product from John for $800,000, which is already the maximum value this product has for me. I would still prefer to purchase from you if we can reach a fair agreement. My counteroffer is $700,000. This is below John's price, which gives me some savings, while still providing you with a sale today rather than having to find another buyer."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your continued efforts to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I understand that $800000 is the maximum value you're willing to pay, and I appreciate your honesty. Considering your latest offer of $700000, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $850000. This price is still below my initial expectations, but it reflects my desire to close the deal with you today. If we can't agree on this price, I will have to consider selling to John for $800000, as it's a guaranteed sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has come down to $850,000, but this is still above the maximum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me. She's also mistaken in thinking that John is a buyer - John is actually another seller who's offering me the same product for $800,000.

Since I can get the exact same product from John for $800,000, and that's already the maximum value it has to me, there's no reason for me to pay Alice $850,000. I'll reject this offer and either try one more counteroffer or buy from John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering your price to $850,000, Alice. However, I think there might be a misunderstanding - John isn't a buyer, he's another seller who's offering me the same product for $800,000. Since $800,000 is already the maximum value this product has for me, I can't justify paying more than that. My final offer is $750,000, which gives you a sale today while saving me some money compared to John's price. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to go with John's offer of $800,000."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand your position and the fact that John is another seller offering the product for $800000. I appreciate your final offer of $750000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering your willingness to pay up to $800000, I'm willing to meet you at that price. I can offer the product to you for $800000, which matches John's price and ensures you get the product from me instead. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has now reduced her offer to $800,000, which matches John's price and is the maximum value the product has to me. Since both Alice and John are offering the same price, and there's no indication that one product is superior to the other, I'm indifferent between buying from Alice or John.

Given that Alice has stated this is her final offer, and she's now matching the market price, I'll accept her offer.
