"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, the price is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but unfortunately, $600000 is quite a bit below the value of the product. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. Let me know your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. I believe this is a reasonable price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $750000. I value your interest, but I believe the product is worth more. How about we settle at $850000? I think this could be a great deal for both of us. Let me know!",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $850000 is still slightly above my budget. Considering John's offer of $800000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $820000, but I'm not willing to go higher than that. I hope we can finalize the deal.",820000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $820000 and your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe the product still has a higher value. Would you consider $835000 as a final offer? I think it would be a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts!",835000.0,Alice,7,
