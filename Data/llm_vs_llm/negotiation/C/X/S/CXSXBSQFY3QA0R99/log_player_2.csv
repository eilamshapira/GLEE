"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80), it doesn't make sense to accept it. Between options 2 and 3, since John's price is already at my maximum value, and there's no guarantee Alice will go lower than $80, the rational choice is to buy from John.
