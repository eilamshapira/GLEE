"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's price ($15,000), and this is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, there's no advantage in choosing one over the other. However, since Alice made the first offer and we're already in communication, I might as well accept her offer rather than going through the process of finding John.
