Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Targeting the Value:** I know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob. I want to capture as much of that value as possible, but also make the deal attractive enough for him to accept.
*   **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Asking for the full $15,000 upfront might be too aggressive and lead to a quick rejection. Starting slightly lower leaves room for potential counter-offers and a feeling of winning for Bob if we settle closer to $14,000.
*   **Above My Minimum:** $14,000 is well above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, ensuring a profitable sale.
*   **Psychological Pricing:** $14,000 feels significantly less than $15,000"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed better outcome than accepting Bob's offer. However, there's still potential to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a higher price than $12,000. Therefore, I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Anchoring Higher:** Bob's initial offer was surprisingly low. I need to adjust his expectations and re-anchor the negotiation at a higher price point.
*   **Still Below Bob's Value:** $13,500 is still significantly below the $15,000 value Bob places on the product. This gives him an incentive to continue negotiating, as he's still getting a good deal if he accepts.
*   **Protecting My Profit:** This price is comfortably above my minimum of $12,000 and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. I am aiming for a price between 13000 and 14000. This counteroffer leaves room for Bob to come up a little.
*   **Avoiding a Standoff:** A small decrease from my original $14,000 shows I'm willing to negotiate in good faith, preventing a potential standoff where Bob walks away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $12,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I initially aimed for a higher price, securing $12,500 is still a good outcome. The potential gain from further negotiation is likely minimal, and there's a risk Bob might walk away or lower his offer in the next round. Accepting now guarantees a profit. Also the difference between 12000 and 12500 is big enough to accept Bob's offer instead of selling to John."
