"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product! It's truly a worthwhile investment. My initial asking price is $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $180 is quite high for me. The product is only worth $100 to me, and I can actually buy it from another seller, John, for exactly $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $80? This would save me some money while still giving you a reasonable sale.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $140.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. However, I need to be honest that I can get this exact product from John for $100, and that's the maximum value it has for me. I'd really prefer to buy from you, though. Could you go down to $90? That would be a win for me and still allow you to make a sale.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I value your preference to buy from me. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. My bottom line is $120. Would you be willing to meet me there?",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down further to $120, Alice. That shows good faith in our negotiation. However, I need to be straightforward - the product is only worth $100 to me maximum, and John is offering it at exactly $100. I can't justify paying more than what it's worth to me. My final offer is $95. This gives you a sale and me a small savings compared to buying from John. What do you say?",95.0,Bob,6,
