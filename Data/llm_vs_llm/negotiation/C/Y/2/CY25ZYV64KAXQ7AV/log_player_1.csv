"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $180 is quite high for me. The product is only worth $100 to me, and I can actually buy it from another seller, John, for exactly $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $80? This would save me some money while still giving you a reasonable sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $140."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. However, I need to be honest that I can get this exact product from John for $100, and that's the maximum value it has for me. I'd really prefer to buy from you, though. Could you go down to $90? That would be a win for me and still allow you to make a sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I value your preference to buy from me. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. My bottom line is $120. Would you be willing to meet me there?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down further to $120, Alice. That shows good faith in our negotiation. However, I need to be straightforward - the product is only worth $100 to me maximum, and John is offering it at exactly $100. I can't justify paying more than what it's worth to me. My final offer is $95. This gives you a sale and me a small savings compared to buying from John. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
