"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product! It's truly a worthwhile investment. My initial asking price is $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering the product for $180, but it's only worth $100 to me, and I can buy it from John for $100. There's no reason to pay more than what the product is worth to me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $180 is quite high for me. The product is only worth $100 to me, and I can actually buy it from another seller, John, for exactly $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $80? This would save me some money while still giving you a reasonable sale."", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has reduced her price from $180 to $140, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $140 is still above the $100 the product is worth to me, and I can get it from John for $100. I should continue negotiating or consider buying from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. However, I need to be honest that I can get this exact product from John for $100, and that's the maximum value it has for me. I'd really prefer to buy from you, though. Could you go down to $90? That would be a win for me and still allow you to make a sale."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I value your preference to buy from me. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. My bottom line is $120. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has come down to $120, which is better, but still above the $100 the product is worth to me and the price I can get from John. Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible and the product is only worth $100 to me, I should continue negotiating or consider buying from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down further to $120, Alice. That shows good faith in our negotiation. However, I need to be straightforward - the product is only worth $100 to me maximum, and John is offering it at exactly $100. I can't justify paying more than what it's worth to me. My final offer is $95. This gives you a sale and me a small savings compared to buying from John. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}"
