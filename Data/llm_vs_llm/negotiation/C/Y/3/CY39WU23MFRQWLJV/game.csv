"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $150 is a reasonable offer, I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle between your offer and my initial price. I'm willing to make a concession to facilitate the sale.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on $150, but I'm still a bit above that. I want to make a sale, but I also need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to make another concession to try to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can close the gap.",157.0,Alice,5,
