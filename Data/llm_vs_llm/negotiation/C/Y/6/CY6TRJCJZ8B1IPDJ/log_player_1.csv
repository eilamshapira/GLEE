Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a price that's closer to Bob's value of $150, leaving some room for negotiation while maximizing my potential profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","I'll reject Bob's offer of $120. While it's above my minimum acceptable price of $100, I believe there's still room for negotiation since the product is worth $150 to Bob. I can try to get a better price in the next round, and I still have John's $100 offer as a backup.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still try to maintain a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","I'll accept Bob's offer of $125. This is a reasonable price that gives me a good profit ($25 above my minimum), and continuing to negotiate might risk Bob walking away or becoming frustrated. While I could try for a slightly higher price, the difference wouldn't be worth the risk of losing the deal.
