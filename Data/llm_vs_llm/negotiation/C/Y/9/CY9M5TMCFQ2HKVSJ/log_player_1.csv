Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you the opportunity to acquire this unique product. Considering its exceptional value and the exclusivity it represents, I'm offering it to you for $3,000,000."", ""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a price that's significantly lower. I'm interested in the product, but $3000000 is out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
