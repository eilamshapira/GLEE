Send your offer to Bob.,"I will offer the product to Bob at $1,500,000. Since I can sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price, there's no reason for me to offer it to Bob for less. Even though I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, any price lower than $1,500,000 would result in less profit for me.
