"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand $200 might be beyond your budget, $120 is a bit low considering the product's quality and market value. I can offer it to you for $170. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, reflecting my willingness to work with you.",170.0,Alice,3,
