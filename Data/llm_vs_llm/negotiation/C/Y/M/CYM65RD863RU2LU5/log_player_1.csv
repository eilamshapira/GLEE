Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product to offer you today. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $200. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 200}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but $200 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $120 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will reject Bob's offer of $120 and make a counteroffer. While it's higher than John's $100, I believe we can reach a better agreement. Bob's willingness to negotiate from $200 to $120 shows there might be room for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand $200 might be beyond your budget, $120 is a bit low considering the product's quality and market value. I can offer it to you for $170. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, reflecting my willingness to work with you."", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for considering my offer, Alice. I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $130? I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $130 and make another counteroffer. While Bob has increased his offer slightly from $120 to $130, there still seems to be room for negotiation. Since Bob is willing to increase his price, we might be able to meet at a more favorable point between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer of $130. You're showing good faith in our negotiation, and I'd like to continue working towards a mutually beneficial agreement. Given the product's value, I can come down to $150. This represents a significant discount from my initial price and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 150}"
