"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. $250 is too steep for me. How about we settle at $60? I'm ready to buy right away if that works for you.",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is significantly below the product's value. The quality and features make it worth at least $220. I'd be happy to work with you on the price, but I need to stay closer to its fair market value. Can you consider $220?",220.0,Alice,3,
