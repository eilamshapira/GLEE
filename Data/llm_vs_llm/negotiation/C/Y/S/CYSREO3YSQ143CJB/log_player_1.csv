You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is significantly below the product's value. The quality and features make it worth at least $220. I'd be happy to work with you on the price, but I need to stay closer to its fair market value. Can you consider $220?"", ""product_price"": 220}"
