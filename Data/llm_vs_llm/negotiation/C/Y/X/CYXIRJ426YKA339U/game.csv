"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about the product's market value, but I'm aiming to spend a bit less.  How about $105?  I think that's a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $105 is a bit too low considering the product's quality and value. I can come down to $115, which is already a good discount from my initial offer. This price reflects the true value of what you're getting.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $115 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference and settle at $110. This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to close the deal quickly. ",110.0,Bob,4,
