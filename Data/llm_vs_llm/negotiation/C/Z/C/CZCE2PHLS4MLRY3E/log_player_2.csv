"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($10,000), and I can get the same product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in accepting Alice's offer immediately. However, I also don't want to give up the potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer, hoping to negotiate a lower price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable considering the product's value to me. Since I know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, I'll start by offering a price that is lower than that, to leave room for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $9,500 is closer to my target price, but I still think I can negotiate a better deal. Since Alice rejected my previous offer of $6,000 and came back with a price of $9,500, it suggests that she is willing to negotiate but is not willing to go as low as I initially offered. I'll try to meet her halfway between my previous offer and her new offer.

My next counteroffer will be $7,750. This price is higher than my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise, but still lower than Alice's current offer, indicating that I'm looking for a better deal.
