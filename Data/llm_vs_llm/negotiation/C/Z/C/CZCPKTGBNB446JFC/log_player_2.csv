"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given that the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me and John is willing to sell it for exactly $1,000,000, Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is not reasonable. It's double the maximum I'm willing to pay and double what I can get it for elsewhere.
