"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to consider this offer carefully:

Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is exactly the amount it's worth to her. This is also $400,000 more than my maximum value for the product ($800,000).

I have the option to buy from John for $800,000, which matches my maximum value but doesn't save me any money.

Since Alice is starting with her maximum value, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This gives me the opportunity to negotiate a better price than what John is offering.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives us room to negotiate:

{""product_price"": $600,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her price from $1,200,000 to $1,150,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still $350,000 above my maximum value of $800,000.

Since John is offering the product at $800,000, and Alice's current offer is significantly higher than that, I should continue negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a better price than John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly but still aim for a price better than John's:

{""product_price"": $650,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has lowered her price again to $1,100,000, continuing to show willingness to negotiate. She's now reduced her price by $100,000 total from her initial offer.

However, her current offer is still $300,000 above my maximum value and $300,000 more than John's offer of $800,000. At this rate of negotiation, it's unlikely we'll reach a price below John's offer within the remaining rounds.

I should continue negotiating to see if we can make more progress.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer again to show good faith in the negotiation, but still aim to get a better price than John's:

{""product_price"": $700,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her price to $1,050,000, which is another $50,000 reduction. While this shows continued willingness to negotiate, her offer is still $250,000 above John's price of $800,000.

We only have a few rounds left, and at the current pace of negotiation (about $50,000 reduction per round), it's unlikely Alice will offer a price below John's $800,000 in the remaining rounds.

Given this situation, I should continue negotiating once more to see if Alice will make a significant concession.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make one more significant increase in my offer to signal that I'm approaching my limit, but still aiming for a price below John's:

{""product_price"": $750,000}"
