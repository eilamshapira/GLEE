"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a limited-time deal on this outstanding product. For you, I'm setting the price at $149. It's an exclusive opportunity to own something truly valuable, so let me know if you're in! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $149. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $149
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is very close to your maximum budget. By rejecting it, you're hoping she'll come back with a lower price, closer to the product's value to her. You're willing to risk buying from John at $150 if she doesn't budge."
