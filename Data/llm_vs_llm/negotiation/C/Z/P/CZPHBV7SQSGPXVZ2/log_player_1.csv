"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! Considering its quality, I'm selling it for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","This is a tough spot. Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I need to make a profit.

Considering my options, I will **Reject Bob's offer** and see if I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're working with a budget, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell the product for $175."", ""product_price"": 175}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $175 is still above what I'm looking to spend. Could you consider $85? Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","This is getting frustrating. Bob is still very far from my minimum price. I need to consider whether I keep negotiating or cut my losses.

Selling to John for $150 is looking more and more appealing. I still have some rounds left, but Bob's offers are not getting closer to my desired price.

I'll **Reject Bob's offer** one more time, but I'm starting to lean towards selling to John if Bob's next offer isn't much better.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer. I'm going to try a slightly different tactic this time, emphasizing the value of the product:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand. However, considering the product's quality and the benefits it offers, I believe it's worth more. I'm willing to come down to $160, but that's my final offer. This is a great deal for a product like this!"", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $160 is still too high for me. How about we try $90? I really want to find a middle ground that works for us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","This is the point where I have to seriously consider selling to John. Bob's offers are consistently far below my minimum profit. I only have a few rounds left.

I've been patient, but I can't keep negotiating with someone who is so far from my price. I'm going to **Sell to John**.
