"Hello Bob, I'm offering a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm willing to sell it for $25000. This is a competitive price given the product's features and benefits. Let me know if you're interested.",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. Considering the product's features and benefits, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal if we can meet at this point.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $8000 is significantly below what I can accept. The product has substantial value, and my minimum acceptable price is $15000, which is what I've been offered elsewhere. Given the quality and benefits of this product, I believe a fair price would be $20000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I cannot go below my minimum threshold of $15000.",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your understanding and for sharing your minimum acceptable price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $20000 is still above my budget. Considering your minimum threshold of $15000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your minimum acceptable price.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I understand budget constraints can be challenging. However, I need to be clear that my absolute minimum is $15000, which is what I've been offered elsewhere. Your offer of $10000 is still significantly below this threshold. I'm willing to come down from my previous offer to $17500, which I believe is fair considering the product's value. If we can't reach an agreement closer to my minimum, I'll need to accept the other offer available to me.",17500.0,Alice,5,
