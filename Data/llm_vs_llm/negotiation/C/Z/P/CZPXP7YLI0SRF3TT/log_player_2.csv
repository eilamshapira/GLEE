Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $8000 is significantly below what I can accept. The product has substantial value, and my minimum acceptable price is $15000, which is what I've been offered elsewhere. Given the quality and benefits of this product, I believe a fair price would be $20000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I cannot go below my minimum threshold of $15000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand budget constraints can be challenging. However, I need to be clear that my absolute minimum is $15000, which is what I've been offered elsewhere. Your offer of $10000 is still significantly below this threshold. I'm willing to come down from my previous offer to $17500, which I believe is fair considering the product's value. If we can't reach an agreement closer to my minimum, I'll need to accept the other offer available to me.
