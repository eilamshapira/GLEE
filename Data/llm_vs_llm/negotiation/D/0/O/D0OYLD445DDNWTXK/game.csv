"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity. Given its immense value and the benefits it will bring to you, I'm proposing a price of $1750000. I believe this reflects the unique nature of the product and the significant return you'll see on your investment.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1750000 is a bit higher than my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1400000. This is a fair price that reflects the benefits I expect to receive from the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget considerations. While $1750000 truly reflects the product's exceptional qualities, I am willing to come down a bit. However, $1400000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1650000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1650000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1550000. This price is fair and allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
