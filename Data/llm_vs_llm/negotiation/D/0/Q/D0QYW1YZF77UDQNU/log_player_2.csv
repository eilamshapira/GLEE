"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $2,500,000 is significantly higher than the maximum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me. It's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $1,000,000. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 500000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $500,000, which is half of John's price. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to John's offer. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground that's below $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $2,000,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000). While Alice has reduced the price by $500,000, it's still not a competitive offer. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a price point below $1,000,000. If we can't reach an agreement soon, buying from John remains a viable backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'm increasing my offer to $700,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer of $500,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and move toward a middle ground, while still keeping the price well below John's offer of $1,000,000. This gives Alice room to make a profit while potentially saving me money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John for $1,000,000. Here's my reasoning:
1. Alice's latest offer ($1,800,000) is still well above both my maximum value and John's price
2. While Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate by reducing her price, the reductions have been relatively small
3. We've gone through 5 rounds already, and we're still $800,000 above John's price
4. Given the pace of negotiations and Alice's high counter-offers, it seems unlikely we'll reach a price below $1,000,000
5. To avoid wasting more time and risking ending up with no deal, it's best to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000"
