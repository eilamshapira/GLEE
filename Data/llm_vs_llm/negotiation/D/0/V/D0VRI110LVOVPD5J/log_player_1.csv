"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This price reflects the product's true worth while still providing you with room for value."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $11500 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you consider $10500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer. The price of $10,500 is too close to my minimum acceptable price, and I know the product is worth more to Bob. Let me try to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot go that low. The product's quality and market value justify a higher price. I can reduce my initial asking price to $11,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value, but my budget is a concern. How about we meet in the middle at $10750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $10,750. While it's lower than my initial target, it's still $750 more than John's guaranteed offer, and we've reached a reasonable middle ground after multiple rounds of negotiation. Further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether, and the current offer provides a fair profit margin."
