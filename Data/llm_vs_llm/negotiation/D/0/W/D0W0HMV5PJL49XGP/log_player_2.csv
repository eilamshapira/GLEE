{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth exploring if I can get a better price from Alice.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get closer to my $1,500,000 limit."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to start by making a bold counteroffer at $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and will test her willingness to negotiate."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. While $1,140,000 is a better price than her initial offer, I'm still not convinced it's the best I can get. I'll try to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $1,050,000. This shows that I'm serious about buying, but still trying to get a good deal."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

$1,090,000 is a good price considering my budget and the fact that we're getting close to the end of the negotiation.  It's worth accepting this offer and moving forward."
