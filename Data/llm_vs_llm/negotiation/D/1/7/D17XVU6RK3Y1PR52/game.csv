"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $5000000 is out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I believe it's worth $1000000 to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer to purchase it at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, the value of this product to me is significantly higher than $1000000.
