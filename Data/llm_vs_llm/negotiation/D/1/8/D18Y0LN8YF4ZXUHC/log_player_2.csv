"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a great product for you. I believe it will be highly valuable and beneficial. Would you like to purchase it for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's initial offer of $120 is below my maximum budget of $150, I'm willing to consider it. However, I also want to try to save as much money as possible. Given that this is the first round and I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, I'll choose to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, to test the waters and see how flexible she is on the price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest. The product is quite valuable, and I'd like to offer it to you for $110. I believe this is a fair price given its benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $110 is still below my maximum budget of $150, but it's also higher than my previous counteroffer of $90. Since Alice rejected my previous offer, I'll try to meet her halfway and make another counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one.

However, before making a counteroffer, I'll consider accepting Alice's offer of $110. It's a reasonable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by making too many counteroffers.

But, I'll still try to negotiate a bit more. I'll reject Alice's offer and make a new counteroffer of $100, which is closer to my target price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll send a counteroffer to Alice, trying to find a mutually beneficial price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your revised offer. I'm still very interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $100 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering my budget and the product's value. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}"
