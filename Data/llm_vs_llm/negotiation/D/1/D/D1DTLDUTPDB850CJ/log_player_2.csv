"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $100, but it's only worth $80 to me at most. Meanwhile, John is offering the same product for $80, which exactly matches my maximum value for it.

While I could reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, there's a simpler solution available. Since John's price matches my maximum value, and Alice's price exceeds my maximum value, the logical choice is to buy from John.
