Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000}

Rationale: I'm choosing to offer the product at $1,200,000 because:
1. I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $1,000,000
3. By asking for $1,200,000, I create room for potential negotiation while still maintaining a strong position
4. If Bob accepts, I make an additional $200,000 over my guaranteed minimum
5. If Bob rejects, I still get my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 from John
This is a low-risk strategy that gives me the opportunity to maximize my profit while having a secure fallback option."
