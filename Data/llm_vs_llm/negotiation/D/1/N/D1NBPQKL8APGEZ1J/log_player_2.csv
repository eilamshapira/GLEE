"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","The offer from Alice is $300, which is significantly higher than the product's worth to me ($120) and also higher than John's price ($120). It doesn't make sense for me to accept this offer.

Since John is offering the product at exactly the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($120), I could just buy from him. However, I might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice first.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice that gives us room to negotiate but is also fair.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $280.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $280
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has only slightly reduced her price from $300 to $280, which is still more than double what the product is worth to me ($120) and more than John's price. This offer doesn't make economic sense for me to accept.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has only come down slightly from her initial offer, so I need to move my counteroffer up a bit to show good faith while still aiming for a price better than John's $120.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $250.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice is still offering a price ($250) that's more than twice John's price of $120. Since the product is only worth $120 to me at maximum, this offer doesn't make economic sense.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice is gradually lowering her price, but it's still much higher than my maximum value and John's price. I'll increase my offer slightly to show I'm negotiating in good faith.
