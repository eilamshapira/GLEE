"Hello Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $1500000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something of great value. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is far beyond my budget. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me, and I actually have another seller offering it at that price. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can offer $700000 for the product. This would allow you to make a quick sale while giving me some room in my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $700000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to lower my initial offer to $1300000, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1250000, which is a fair compromise. This is the best I can do while still maintaining the integrity of the product's worth. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $1250000 is still well above what I can justify spending. I want to be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $800000, which is my absolute maximum budget for this purchase. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I can raise my offer to $750000, which would give you a quick sale. If we can't get closer to this range, I'll unfortunately need to go with the other seller.",750000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your transparency and your desire to work with us. However, $750000 is still below our minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product at $1225000. This is a significant reduction from our initial price and reflects our willingness to make this deal work. Please consider this offer carefully.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand the pressure you're under with the other offer. To show our commitment to working with you, I'm willing to lower the price further to $1210000. This is our final offer before we consider other options. I hope you can see the value in this proposal.",1210000.0,Alice,5,
