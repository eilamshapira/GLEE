"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something of great value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is far beyond my budget. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me, and I actually have another seller offering it at that price. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can offer $700000 for the product. This would allow you to make a quick sale while giving me some room in my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $700,000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to lower my initial offer to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a fair compromise. This is the best I can do while still maintaining the integrity of the product's worth. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $1250000 is still well above what I can justify spending. I want to be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $800000, which is my absolute maximum budget for this purchase. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I can raise my offer to $750000, which would give you a quick sale. If we can't get closer to this range, I'll unfortunately need to go with the other seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your transparency and your desire to work with us. However, $750,000 is still below our minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product at $1,225,000. This is a significant reduction from our initial price and reflects our willingness to make this deal work. Please consider this offer carefully.""}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand the pressure you're under with the other offer.
