"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $1500000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something of great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value ($800,000) and also much higher than John's alternative offer ($800,000). It's best to reject this offer and make a counteroffer that's more reasonable, or potentially buy from John if negotiations with Alice don't improve significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is far beyond my budget. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and I actually have another seller offering it at that price. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can offer $700,000 for the product. This would allow you to make a quick sale while giving me some room in my budget."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1250000, which is a fair compromise. This is the best I can do while still maintaining the integrity of the product's worth. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,250,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's alternative offer ($800,000). While Alice has reduced the price, it's still not in an acceptable range. I should continue negotiating or consider buying from John if Alice remains inflexible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $1,250,000 is still well above what I can justify spending. I want to be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $800,000, which is my absolute maximum budget for this purchase. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I can raise my offer to $750,000, which would give you a quick sale. If we can't get closer to this range, I'll unfortunately need to go with the other seller."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the pressure you're under with the other offer. To show our commitment to working with you, I'm willing to lower the price further to $1210000. This is our final offer before we consider other options. I hope you can see the value in this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,210,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,210,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price near my maximum budget of $800,000. She's only made minimal reductions from $1,500,000 to $1,250,000 to $1,210,000, and remains far above both my maximum value and John's offer. Since we're halfway through the negotiation rounds and the gap is still over $400,000, it's best to take John's offer of $800,000 rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to reach an acceptable price."
