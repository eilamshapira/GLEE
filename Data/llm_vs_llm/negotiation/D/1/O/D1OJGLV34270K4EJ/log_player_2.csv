"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($1,200,000) and John's alternative price ($1,200,000). It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer when I have the option to either negotiate for a better price or buy from John at a lower price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 900000}

Rationale: I'll start with a counteroffer of $900,000, which is significantly below both John's price and Alice's cost ($1,200,000). This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to save money. If Alice rejects this offer, we can work towards finding a middle ground. Since Alice's cost is $1,200,000, any price above that would be profitable for her, but I want to start low to maximize my potential savings. If the negotiation doesn't progress favorably, I still have the option to buy from John at $1,200,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: Alice has reduced her price from $1,500,000 to $1,400,000, showing some willingness to negotiate. However, this price is still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000. Since I know John's price is my fallback option and matches my maximum valuation, there's no reason to accept a price above $1,200,000. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, trying to get a better price from Alice. If we can't reach an agreement below $1,200,000, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

Rationale: I'll increase my previous offer from $900,000 to $1,000,000. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate and move towards a middle ground, while still keeping the price well below both John's price and Alice's cost. The $100,000 increase from my previous offer shows good faith in the negotiation, but still leaves room for further negotiation. If Alice rejects this offer, I can continue to gradually increase my offers while staying below $1,200,000, or ultimately choose to buy from John if we can't reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
