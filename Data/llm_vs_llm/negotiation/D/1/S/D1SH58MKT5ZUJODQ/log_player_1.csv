Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $50 is significantly lower than the minimum value of $150 that I have for the product, I will not accept it. Additionally, selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed option, but I want to try to negotiate a better price with Bob first.

So, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

My counteroffer is: $180

Let's see how Bob responds to this.
