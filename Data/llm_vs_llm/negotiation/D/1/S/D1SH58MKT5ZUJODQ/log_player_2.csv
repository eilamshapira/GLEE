"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer of $200 is much higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80), it wouldn't make sense to accept it. Between options 2 and 3, since John's price equals my maximum value, it might be worth making a counteroffer to Alice first to try getting a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably lower than Alice's $200 but still gives room for negotiation. Since my maximum value is $80 and John's price is $80, I'll start with a lower offer to see if we can reach a better deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $180 is still significantly higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). While Alice has reduced the price from $200 to $180, it's still not close to a price I would accept. I can either make another counteroffer or buy from John. Since Alice's price is still more than double what I'm willing to pay, and she only made a modest reduction, it's probably best to go with John's guaranteed price of $80.
