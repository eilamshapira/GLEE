"Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000, considering the market value and my budget. I'm looking forward to your response.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $8000. I'm willing to compromise and lower my price. Let's meet in the middle and discuss the details.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and lower the price. However, $18000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
