"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000, considering the market value and my budget. I'm looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $8,000 because it's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle. My next offer will be $18,000, which is slightly lower than my initial offer, to show that I'm willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $8,000. I'm willing to compromise and lower my price. Let's meet in the middle and discuss the details."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and lower the price. However, $18000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $10,000 matches the minimum price I'm willing to accept and also matches the price John is offering, I might as well accept Bob's offer and close the deal with him. Rejecting Bob's offer and trying to negotiate further may risk losing both Bob and John as potential buyers."
