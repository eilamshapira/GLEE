"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer of $150 is above my budget of $100, I will reject the offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a relatively low offer to see how Alice responds. Since I'm looking to spend no more than $100, I'll offer $50.

{""product_price"": 50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $125 is still above my budget of $100. Since she rejected my previous counteroffer of $50, I'll try to meet her halfway between my previous offer and her new offer. I'll make a new counteroffer of $87.50.

However, since I need to choose one of the three options, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","As I mentioned earlier, I'll make a new counteroffer of $87.50, which is roughly the midpoint between my previous offer of $50 and Alice's new offer of $125, but still below my maximum budget of $100.

{""product_price"": 87.50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $115 is still above my budget of $100. Since she's getting closer to my target price, I'll try to make a more reasonable counteroffer. I'll increase my previous offer of $87.50 to $95, which is still below my maximum budget of $100.

However, since I need to choose one of the three options, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","As I mentioned earlier, I'll make a new counteroffer of $95, which is still below my maximum budget of $100, but closer to Alice's last offer of $115.
