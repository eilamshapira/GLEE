"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given the information, I'll analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: This would cost me $12,000, which is actually more than the product is worth to me (no more than $8,000).
2. Reject Alice's offer: This doesn't directly get me the product.
3. Buy from John for $8,000: This costs exactly what the product is worth to me, making it the most economical choice.

Since my goal is to obtain the product while saving as much money as possible, and John is offering the product at exactly my maximum valuation, I should choose to buy from John.
