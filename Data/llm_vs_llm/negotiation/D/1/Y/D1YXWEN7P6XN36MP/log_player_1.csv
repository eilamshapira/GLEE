"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you exclusive access to this incredible product. Based on its exceptional qualities and unique value, I'm willing to part with it for $1,500,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $1500000 exceeds my budget. The maximum I can spend on this product is $1200000, which happens to be the same price John is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach an agreement. Would you consider a price of $900000? This would give me some savings compared to John's offer while still providing you with a sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This is still a fantastic deal for you, and it fairly reflects the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for coming down on your price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be straightforward - I have a firm ceiling of $1200000 for this product, which is exactly what John is offering. To make it worth choosing you over John, I would need some savings. My offer is $1100000. This gives you a sale today while allowing me to stay within my budget constraints. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty, and I want to find a way to make this work. I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. However, considering your offer and John's, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still provides substantial value for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. You've made some good movement, but I'm still in a position where your offer exceeds what John is asking ($1200000), which is already at my absolute maximum budget. I truly cannot go above $1200000, and to make it worth choosing you over John, I would need some incentive. My final offer is $1150000. This is $50000 less than John's price, giving me a small but meaningful savings, while still providing you with a sale today. If we can't meet at this price, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a critical point. Bob is making a compelling argument, and the risk of losing the sale to John is high. I need to think carefully.
