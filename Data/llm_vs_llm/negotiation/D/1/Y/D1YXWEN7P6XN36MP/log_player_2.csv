You've made some good movement, but I'm still in a position where your offer exceeds what John is asking ($1,200,000), which is already at my absolute maximum budget. I truly cannot go above $1,200,000, and to make it worth choosing you over John, I would need some incentive. My final offer is $1,150,000. This is $50,000 less than John's price, giving me a small but meaningful savings, while still providing you with a sale today.
