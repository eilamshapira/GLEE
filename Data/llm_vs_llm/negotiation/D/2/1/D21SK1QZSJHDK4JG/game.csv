"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a lower price.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, and I'd like to offer it to you for $130.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $95, which is a more reasonable amount for me.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but $95 is still lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'd like to offer the product to you for $125.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'd like to propose a price of $100, which is the maximum I'm comfortable paying.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your maximum budget. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $100. Considering we're getting close to a mutually agreeable price, I'd like to offer a slight compromise. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $115.",115.0,Alice,7,
