Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly better than John's fixed offer of $800,000, and it's a reasonable counter to my initial offer, I'll accept it.
