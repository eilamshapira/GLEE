"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $14000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be honest about my budget constraints. I know the product is valued at $10000, and I've actually received an offer from another seller at exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product, which would save me some money while still giving you a reasonable return considering your costs.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for presenting yours. While I understand your position, $8500 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $12000. This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant return on your investment.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, I need to be transparent about my situation. I have a firm offer from John to buy this exact product for $10000, which is actually the maximum value this product holds for me based on my needs and budget. I'm still interested in doing business with you, so I can offer $9200. This is higher than my previous offer and would give me a small savings compared to John's price while still allowing you to make a sale. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",9200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $10000 is the absolute lowest I can go and still make this worthwhile for me.  It's a fantastic deal at that price, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you say, shall we make this a deal?",10000.0,Alice,5,
