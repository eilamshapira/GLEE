Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be honest about my budget constraints. I know the product is valued at $10000, and I've actually received an offer from another seller at exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product, which would save me some money while still giving you a reasonable return considering your costs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, I need to be transparent about my situation. I have a firm offer from John to buy this exact product for $10000, which is actually the maximum value this product holds for me based on my needs and budget. I'm still interested in doing business with you, so I can offer $9200. This is higher than my previous offer and would give me a small savings compared to John's price while still allowing you to make a sale. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200

It's a fantastic deal at that price, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you say, shall we make this a deal?"",
