"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $14000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $14,000, which is $4,000 more than John's price of $10,000. Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $10,000, it doesn't make sense to accept Alice's current offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be honest about my budget constraints. I know the product is valued at $10,000, and I've actually received an offer from another seller at exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product, which would save me some money while still giving you a reasonable return considering your costs."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for presenting yours. While I understand your position, $8500 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $12000. This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $12,000, which is still $2,000 more than John's price of $10,000. Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and I can buy it from John for exactly $10,000, it still doesn't make sense to accept Alice's current offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, I need to be transparent about my situation. I have a firm offer from John to buy this exact product for $10,000, which is actually the maximum value this product holds for me based on my needs and budget. I'm still interested in doing business with you, so I can offer $9,200. This is higher than my previous offer and would give me a small savings compared to John's price while still allowing you to make a sale. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9200}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $10000 is the absolute lowest I can go and still make this worthwhile for me.  It's a fantastic deal at that price, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you say, shall we make this a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has now reduced her offer to $10,000, which is exactly the same as John's price. Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and both sellers are now offering the same price, I could buy from either one.

There's no advantage to continuing the negotiation since Alice has stated this is her absolute lowest price, and it matches what I can get elsewhere. I might as well accept her offer.
