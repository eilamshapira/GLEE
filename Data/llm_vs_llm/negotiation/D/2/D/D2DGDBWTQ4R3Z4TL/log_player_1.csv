Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my initial offer to Bob. The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I have John who will pay exactly that amount. Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so he won't pay more than that.

Given that I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, there's no reason for me to sell to Bob for less than that amount. If I start negotiations with Bob, I should begin with my best possible outcome.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob has rejected my initial offer of $1,500,000 and countered with $800,000, it's clear we're quite far apart. However, I have no incentive to sell to Bob for less than my guaranteed alternative of $1,500,000 from John.
