"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $14000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, but that's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $10000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I can see that we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to make a small concession to meet you closer to your target price, but I still believe the product is worth a bit more than $11000.",11500.0,Alice,5,
