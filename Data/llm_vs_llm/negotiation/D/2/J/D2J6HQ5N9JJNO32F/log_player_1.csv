Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $700,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, I will reject his offer. I will not sell to John yet, as I still have a chance to negotiate a higher price with Bob.

My counteroffer to Bob will be $900,000.
