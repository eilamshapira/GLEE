"Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $16,000 is higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($12,000), it doesn't make sense for me to accept this offer. Additionally, buying from John for $12,000 is an option, but I'd like to try to negotiate with Alice first to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and closer to my target price. Since I'm willing to pay up to $12,000, I'll make an initial counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still shows that I'm interested in negotiating.
