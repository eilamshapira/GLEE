Send your offer to Bob.,"Since I know the product is worth $100 to Bob and $120 to me, I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","I will reject Bob's offer of $80 since it's well below my minimum value of $120. Since I can guarantee $120 from John and Bob's first counteroffer is quite low ($80), it makes more sense to sell to John rather than continue negotiating with Bob, as he's starting from a very low position and is unlikely to reach an acceptable price above $120.
