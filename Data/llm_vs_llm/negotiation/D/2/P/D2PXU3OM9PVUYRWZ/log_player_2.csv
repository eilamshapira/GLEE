"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's offer to see if it makes financial sense for me.

Alice is offering the product for $120. This product is worth no more than $120 to me.

My options:
1. Accept Alice's offer: Pay $120
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: Pay $120

Since Alice is offering the product at exactly the same price as John ($120), and this equals the maximum I'm willing to pay, there's no financial advantage to accepting Alice's offer over buying from John, or vice versa.

However, since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price, especially since I know the product is only worth $80 to her. There's potential for a better deal.
