"Hello Bob! I have a quality product that I'd like to offer you. It's a unique item that I value at $150, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a special price. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $150? If this doesn't work for you, I completely understand, as I have another buyer who is ready to purchase it at this price.",150.0,Alice,1,
