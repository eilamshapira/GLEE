"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to consider the options carefully. Alice is offering the product for $14,000, which is less than John's price of $15,000. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible while buying the product, I should try to negotiate with Alice for a better price rather than immediately accepting her first offer or buying from John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives me room to negotiate while still being fair, considering the product is worth $10,000 to Alice.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price from $14,000 to $13,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is moving in the right direction, but I still have room to negotiate for a better price since I know the product is worth $10,000 to her. The current offer of $13,000 is already better than John's price of $15,000, but I should try to get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down by $1,000 from her initial offer, I'll also adjust my offer upward to show good faith in the negotiation. I'll split the difference between my previous offer and her latest offer.

Round 5

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down to $12,800, which is getting closer to a fair price. She's showing continued willingness to negotiate by reducing her price further. Since we're in round 5 out of 10 possible rounds, I still have time to negotiate for a better price, and her current offer is still well below John's price of $15,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has moved from $13,000 to $12,800, reducing her price by $200. I'll continue to narrow the gap by increasing my offer by a similar amount. This shows I'm negotiating in good faith while still trying to get a better price.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","We're making progress - Alice has reduced her offer to $12,700, which is just $100 lower than her previous offer of $12,800. We're getting very close to an agreement. Since we're now in round 7 of 10, and the difference between our positions is narrowing, I'll accept this offer rather than risk prolonging the negotiation for minimal additional savings.
