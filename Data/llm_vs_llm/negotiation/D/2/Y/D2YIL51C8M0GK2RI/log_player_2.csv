"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that Alice's offer ($12,000) is higher than John's fixed price ($10,000), and the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, I should not accept Alice's current offer. Since John is willing to sell the product for $10,000, there's no reason to pay more than that.

I can either reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, or simply buy from John now. Since I have the option to buy from John at any time, I'll try negotiating with Alice first to see if I can get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably lower than John's price to give Alice a chance to beat the alternative while still giving me a good deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has now offered to sell the product for $10,000, which is the same price that John is offering. Since both sellers are offering the same price, I have no reason to reject Alice's offer or buy from John instead.
