"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer is the same as John's price ($15,000), and this equals my maximum value for the product, I should reject and try to negotiate a better price with Alice. Given that the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, there is room for negotiation to reach a lower price that benefits both parties.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's above Alice's cost ($12,000) but significantly below her initial offer of $15,000. This gives room for negotiation while still allowing Alice to make a profit.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price from $15,000 to $14,000, which is a significant improvement and $1,000 less than John's price. While we might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice could become frustrated and withdraw from negotiations. Since $14,000 gives me $1,000 in savings compared to my alternative option (buying from John), I'll accept this offer.
