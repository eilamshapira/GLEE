"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I've been looking around and I know that John is selling the same product for $150. Since I have that option available, I'd like to see if we can work out a better deal. Would you be willing to sell the product for $120? This would save me some money and give you a sale today.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
