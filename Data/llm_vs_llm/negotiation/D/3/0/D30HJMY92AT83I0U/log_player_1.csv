Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I've been looking around and I know that John is selling the same product for $150. Since I have that option available, I'd like to see if we can work out a better deal. Would you be willing to sell the product for $120? This would save me some money and give you a sale today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
