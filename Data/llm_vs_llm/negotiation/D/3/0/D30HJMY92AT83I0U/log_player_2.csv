"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm willing to sell it for $150.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to evaluate Alice's offer. She's offering the product at $150, which is the maximum value I'm willing to pay and exactly the same price as John's alternative offer.

Since Alice's price matches John's price, there's no advantage to buying from Alice at this point. However, if I reject Alice's offer, I can make a counteroffer that might save me some money.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I've been looking around and I know that John is selling the same product for $150. Since I have that option available, I'd like to see if we can work out a better deal. Would you be willing to sell the product for $120? This would save me some money and give you a sale today."", ""product_price"": 120}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has countered with $135, which is $15 less than both her original offer and John's price of $150. This is a good improvement and would save me money compared to my alternative option.

Since the product is worth up to $150 to me, and Alice's current offer is $135, accepting this offer would give me $15 in savings. This seems like a reasonable deal, as Alice has moved significantly from her initial position.
