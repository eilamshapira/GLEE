"Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer compared to my alternatives.

Alice is offering the product for $16,000, which is $4,000 more than the maximum value of $12,000 that the product is worth to me.

John is offering the same product for $12,000, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me.

Since I want to save as much money as possible while still acquiring the product, and John's offer is $4,000 less than Alice's, the logical choice is to buy from John.
