"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it for $18500. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value. Would you like to proceed with the purchase?",18500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $18500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I must inform you that $8000 is significantly below the product's value. Given its quality and market worth, I cannot go below $14500. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. Would you consider this price?",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming back with a revised price. I appreciate the reduction, but $14500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
