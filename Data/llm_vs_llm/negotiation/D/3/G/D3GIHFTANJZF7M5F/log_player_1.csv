Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it for $18,500. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value. Would you like to proceed with the purchase?"", ""product_price"": 18500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $18500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer because:
1. Bob's offer of $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000
2. Since Bob is still engaging in negotiation and showed interest, there's room to negotiate a better price
3. While I have John's guaranteed $10,000 as a backup, I can still try to get a better price from Bob before considering that option

I'll proceed with making a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I must inform you that $8,000 is significantly below the product's value. Given its quality and market worth, I cannot go below $14,500. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. Would you consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming back with a revised price. I appreciate the reduction, but $14500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John because:
1. Bob's offer is exactly the same as John's guaranteed offer ($10,000)
2. Given Bob's negotiation pattern (starting at $8,000 and moving up to just $10,000), it seems unlikely he'll go significantly higher
3. There's a risk that if I continue negotiating, Bob might lose interest or revert to a lower offer
4. Since both offers are identical, it's more efficient to take the guaranteed sale with John rather than continue negotiations with uncertainty"
