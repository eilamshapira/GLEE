"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $130 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I should mention that I've found the same product elsewhere for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider $85 for the product? This would give me a reason to buy from you rather than your competitor.",85.0,Bob,2,
