Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. I believe it provides great value for that price."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $130 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I should mention that I've found the same product elsewhere for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider $85 for the product? This would give me a reason to buy from you rather than your competitor. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
