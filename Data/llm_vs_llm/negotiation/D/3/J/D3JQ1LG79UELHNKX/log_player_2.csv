"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. I believe it provides great value for that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is pricing the product at $130, which is more than its value to me ($100) and also more than I could pay to buy it from John ($100). Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, accepting this offer wouldn't make sense.

Between options 2 and 3, I could try negotiating with Alice by making a counteroffer, or I could immediately buy from John for $100. Since John's price equals the maximum I'm willing to pay, and Alice is starting much higher than that, it would be reasonable to make a counteroffer first to see if I can get a better deal from Alice.

I should mention that I've found the same product elsewhere for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider $85 for the product? This would give me a reason to buy from you rather than your competitor."", ""product_price"": 85}"
