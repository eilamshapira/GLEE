I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

$75 is way too low for me.  I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price."

I'm coming down a bit, but still keeping the price above my minimum.  Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair offer."

While $87 is closer to what I want, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer."

This is my final offer. It's still a bit above my minimum but  hopefully, Bob will see the value of the product and accept."
