"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Based on its value to you and its rarity, I'm offering it to you for:"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $10000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Given Bob's counteroffer, I have to make a strategic decision. $10,000 is below what the product is worth to me ($15,000). However, it's only Round 2, so I have plenty of time to negotiate. Let's see if we can move towards my target.

Therefore:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, let's try to get closer to a price that works for me.

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints. However, considering the product's exceptional quality, I can't go that low. How about this: "", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $11000, which is the maximum I can afford. Please let me know if you can accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a tricky situation. $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. However, I'm starting to worry I might not get a better offer from Bob. I'm also using up rounds, and I don't want to end up with nothing. I think I'll go with a counteroffer, but I'll be aggressive and try to close the deal in the next round.

Therefore:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, time to try to close this deal.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you a bit closer. I can offer the product for: "", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for coming down on the price. However, $16000 is still out of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $11500 as my final offer. If this works for you, let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is not looking good. Bob's final offer is still well below what I need to make. I'm not getting anywhere with this negotiation. I can either reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further or sell the product to John. It's round 6, I have 4 rounds left. I can reject Bob's offer and take a chance in the next round and make a counteroffer, or I can sell it to John for $15,000. I think I should sell it to John.

Therefore:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
