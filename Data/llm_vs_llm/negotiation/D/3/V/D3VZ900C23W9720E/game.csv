"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your asking price is significantly higher than I had in mind.  I'd be willing to pay $5000 for it. Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5000 is too low. I’m countering with an offer of $20000. Let me know your thoughts.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you have a budget in mind but given the premium quality and features of this product, $5000 doesn’t reflect its true value. I’m prepared to offer it for $20000, which I believe is fair and competitive. Let me know your thoughts on this offer.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for coming down, however, the price is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $7000? I think that's a fair offer reflecting both the product's value and my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob's offer doesn't meet my minimum requirement. I have a guaranteed buyer, John, for $12000, so I'll sell it to him.",,Alice,4,SellToJhon
