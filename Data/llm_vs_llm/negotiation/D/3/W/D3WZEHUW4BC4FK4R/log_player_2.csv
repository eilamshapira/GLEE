"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident you'd be very happy with it. I'm offering it to you for $10500, which is a fair price considering its worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth $10,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $10,500
3. John is willing to sell it for $10,000

Since:
- Alice's offer ($10,500) is above my maximum value ($10,000)
- John's price ($10,000) matches my maximum value
- There's no benefit in paying $500 more to Alice

The logical choice is to buy from John, who offers the same product at a lower price that matches my maximum value.
