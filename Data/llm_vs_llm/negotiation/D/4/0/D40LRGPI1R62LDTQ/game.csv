,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $50 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",50.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. However, $50 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to lower my price to $125, considering your budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",125.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 was too high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $125. This is a good deal considering the value of the product. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. While $125 is better, it's still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $60?",60.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is still below my minimum price. I can go as low as $110, which is a significant discount from my original price. Let me know if this works for you.",110.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower the price further to $110. This is the best I can do while still valuing the product appropriately. Let me know if you can meet me at this price.",110.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate you continuing to work with me, Alice. I'm still a ways off at $110.  I could go up to $70.  Does that work for you?",70.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. However, $70 is still not enough for me to part with the product. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is very close to my bottom line. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",105.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I need to stick to my minimum value. I can offer the product for $105, which is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Okay, Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $75?  This is my final offer.",75.0,Bob,8,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but $75 is still below what I can accept. My last offer stands at $105, which is the lowest I can go. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider selling to another buyer. Let me know your decision.",105.0,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're at a critical point. My offer of $105 is my absolute bottom line. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to consider other options. Please let me know if you can meet me at this price.",105.0,Alice,9,
