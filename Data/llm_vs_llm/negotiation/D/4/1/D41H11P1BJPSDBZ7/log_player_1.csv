Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider the situation carefully. 

I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, which is exactly the same as my minimum acceptable value. If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell to John for $1,500,000, so I don't lose anything by making a higher offer to Bob.

Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, he would be indifferent between accepting and rejecting at exactly that price. To make it slightly favorable for him to accept, I could offer a small discount, but there's no real incentive for me to do so since I have a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price.

I'll offer Bob the product at $1,500,000, which is fair given the product's value to him.
