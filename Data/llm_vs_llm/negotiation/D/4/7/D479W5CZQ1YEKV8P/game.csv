"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, $180 is above my budget. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $150, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you be willing to sell it for $120? This would save me a bit of money and still provide you with a sale today.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and candid response. Since you mentioned you can get the product elsewhere for $150, I can offer you a better price than that. Would you consider $145? This is a fair discount from my initial offer and still saves you money compared to other sellers.",145.0,Alice,3,
