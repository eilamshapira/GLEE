Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, $180 is above my budget. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $150, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you be willing to sell it for $120? This would save me a bit of money and still provide you with a sale today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer to Bob. While his offer matches John's price, I believe there's room for negotiation since he mentioned he can get it elsewhere for $150. This suggests he values the product at least at that price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and candid response. Since you mentioned you can get the product elsewhere for $150, I can offer you a better price than that. Would you consider $145? This is a fair discount from my initial offer and still saves you money compared to other sellers."", ""product_price"": 145}"
