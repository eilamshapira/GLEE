"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $180. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to analyze this situation carefully. Alice is offering the product for $180, but the product is only worth up to $150 to me. Since John is willing to sell the same product for $150, there's no reason for me to pay more than that to Alice.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This gives me a chance to potentially get the product for less than $150 from Alice, while knowing I always have the $150 option with John as a backup.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, $180 is above my budget. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $150, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you be willing to sell it for $120? This would save me a bit of money and still provide you with a sale today."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and candid response. Since you mentioned you can get the product elsewhere for $150, I can offer you a better price than that. Would you consider $145? This is a fair discount from my initial offer and still saves you money compared to other sellers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has countered with $145, which is a good improvement from her initial $180 offer and is $5 less than John's price of $150. Since the product is worth up to $150 to me, and Alice is now offering it for less than what I could get elsewhere, this is a good deal.

I'll accept Alice's offer and purchase the product for $145, saving $5 compared to buying from John.
