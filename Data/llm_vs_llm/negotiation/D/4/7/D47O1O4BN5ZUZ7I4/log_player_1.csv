(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, let's analyze.

*   **Accepting $90:** This is better than selling to John for $80.
*   **Rejecting and Counteroffering:** Bob is willing to pay more than $90. I can try to get closer to his value ($150). I also know I can sell to John if negotiations go too far.

Considering my profit goal, I will **reject** Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.
