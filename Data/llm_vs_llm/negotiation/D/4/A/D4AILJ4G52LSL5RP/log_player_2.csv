"Alice's offer: The product price will be $199. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $199
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and Alice's offer is $199, which is significantly higher than my maximum budget, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $80.
