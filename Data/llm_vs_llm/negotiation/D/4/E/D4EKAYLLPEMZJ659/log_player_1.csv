Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm willing to make a deal with you. Let's start with a price that I think is fair."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  That price is a little steep for me though. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $60 is below my minimum threshold of $80, and I have the option to sell to John for $80, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I will also not sell to John immediately, as there is a possibility that Bob may be willing to increase his offer. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $100 might be a bit steep, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $75 is still below my desired price, but closer to my minimum threshold of $80, I will consider my options carefully. Accepting Bob's offer would mean selling the product for less than I could get from John, which doesn't make sense. Rejecting Bob's offer and making another counteroffer might lead to a better price, but it also risks Bob walking away from the deal. Selling to John for $80 is still an option, and it's a price that I know I can get.

In this case, I think the best option is to sell the product to John for $80, since it's a guaranteed price that is higher than Bob's current offer.
