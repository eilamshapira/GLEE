"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $75 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $140. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with at the moment.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $140 is still above what I'm willing to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $85 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $130. This is a significant reduction from my original price, and I believe it's a fair value considering the product's quality.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $130, but it's still a bit high for me. Let's try to close the gap further. How about $90? I think this could be a good compromise for both of us.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle and offer the product to you for $120. This is a significant concession from my original price, and I believe it's a fair value considering the product's quality and our negotiations so far.",120.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price to $120, but I'm still hoping we can find a better deal. How about $95? This is close to my maximum budget, and I think it's a fair price given our negotiations.",95.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, and I'm willing to make one more concession to try to close the deal. I'll offer the product to you for $110. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and our negotiations. If this doesn't work for you, I may need to explore other options.",110.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $110 is just above what I'm willing to spend. Let's make this work at $100. It's the maximum I can go, and I believe it's a fair price given our negotiations and the value of the product to me.",100.0,Bob,10,
