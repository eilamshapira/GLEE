Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price. However, Bob might value it higher, so I should aim above $800,000. Setting it too high risks rejection, but setting it too low leaves money on the table. I'll set a price with a reasonable markup.
