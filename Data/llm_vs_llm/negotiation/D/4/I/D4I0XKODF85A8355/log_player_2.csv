"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a incredible offer for you that I think you'll find very interesting. I'm willing to sell my premium product to you for $2000000. This product is highly valuable, and I'm confident that it will meet and exceed your expectations. If you accept the offer please let me know. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,200,000
2. Alice is offering to sell me the product for $2,000,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $1,200,000

Alice's price ($2,000,000) is significantly higher than my maximum value ($1,200,000) and higher than John's offer ($1,200,000). It makes no economic sense to accept Alice's offer when I can get the same product from John at a lower price that matches my maximum value.
