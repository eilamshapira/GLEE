"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe the value is more than worth the price. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since the offered price of $1,500,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,200,000, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of negotiating a better price.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is reasonable and within my budget. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start by offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still shows that I'm interested in the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1000000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1300000 to show my commitment to finding a deal, but I can't go any lower than that.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's new offer of $1,300,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000, I will reject Alice's offer again. Buying from John for $1,200,000 is starting to look like a more attractive option, but I'll try to negotiate with Alice a bit more to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer that is closer to my maximum budget, but still tries to save some money. Since Alice has already come down from $1,500,000 to $1,300,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between her last offer and my maximum budget.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is really my top limit, and I'd be willing to make a deal at this price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
