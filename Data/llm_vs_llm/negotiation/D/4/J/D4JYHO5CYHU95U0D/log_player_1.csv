Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $4,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value of $15,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have 8 more rounds to negotiate, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

My counteroffer will be $19,000.

Although the negotiation is halfway through, I don't see a significant increase in Bob's offers, and I'm starting to consider the guaranteed sale to John.

However, I'll give Bob another chance to increase his offer. My next counteroffer will be slightly lower, at $17,000, to see if Bob is willing to meet me closer to my target price.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $7,000 is still far below the minimum value of $15,000 that the product is worth to me. With only 2 rounds left, I'm starting to lose hope that Bob will meet my target price.

Considering the low increase in Bob's offers and the limited number of rounds left, I think it's time to consider the guaranteed sale to John. Selling to John for $15,000 is a more attractive option than continuing to negotiate with Bob, who may not be willing to pay a fair price.
