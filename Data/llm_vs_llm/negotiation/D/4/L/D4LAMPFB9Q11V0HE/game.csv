"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must be transparent - I cannot accept anything below $15000 for this product as that's its minimum value to me. I understand this might be above your initial budget, but I can come down to $16000 from my initial offer. This is the best I can do while still maintaining a fair margin.",16000.0,Alice,3,
