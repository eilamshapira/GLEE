"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and benefits."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. After some thought, I'm willing to raise my offer to $5500. I believe this is a fair price given my budget and the market conditions. How does this work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $5,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but if we can't get closer to my minimum price, I'll have to consider John's guaranteed offer of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must be transparent - I cannot accept anything below $15,000 for this product as that's its minimum value to me. I understand this might be above your initial budget, but I can come down to $16,000 from my initial offer. This is the best I can do while still maintaining a fair margin."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your patience, Alice. I want to work with you on this. How about I raise my offer to $6500? This is moving closer to your valuation while still being feasible for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John. Bob's offers are still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and he's only making small incremental increases. Since the product is worth no less than $15,000 to me, and Bob's latest offer of $6,500 is still less than half of that, it makes more sense to accept John's guaranteed offer of $15,000 rather than continue negotiations that seem unlikely to reach my minimum price point."
