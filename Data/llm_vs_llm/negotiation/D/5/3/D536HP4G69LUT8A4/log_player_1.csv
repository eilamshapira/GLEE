Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what price I should offer to Bob that maximizes my profit while still having a reasonable chance of acceptance. Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I need to make a strategic decision.

If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell to John for $80, which is my guaranteed minimum. However, I should try to get more than this from Bob if possible.

I'll offer a price that provides a reasonable premium over my minimum value, but not so high that Bob is likely to reject it outright.
