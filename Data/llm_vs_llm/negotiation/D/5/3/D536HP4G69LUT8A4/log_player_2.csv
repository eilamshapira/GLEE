"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer ($120) is higher than my maximum valuation ($100) and higher than John's price ($100), it would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. Given that John's offer is exactly at my maximum valuation, I'll buy from John.
