Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I really like the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I can offer $70, which I think is fair given the market rates. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
