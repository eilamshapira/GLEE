"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product today. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $13500. This represents excellent value considering its features and benefits. I look forward to your response.",13500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, I believe $13500 is rather steep. Given current market conditions and similar products available, I would be willing to pay $9800 for it. This is a fair price that would still provide you with a good return. I look forward to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",9800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter offer. However, $9800 is significantly below the true value of this product. Given its quality, features, and current market value, I can come down to $12200. This is already a substantial discount from my initial offer and represents excellent value for you while still allowing me a reasonable return. I hope we can find middle ground that works for both of us.",12200.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I've done my market research, and considering comparable products available, I can offer $10800. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and would provide you with a solid profit margin while still being a fair price for the product's value. I hope we can find agreement at this price point.",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your willingness to negotiate. You're moving in the right direction, but I'm still not able to go as low as $10800 given what this product is worth. I can come down to $11500, which I believe represents a fair compromise between our positions. This price gives you excellent value while still allowing me a reasonable return. I hope we can finalize our deal at this price point.",11500.0,Alice,5,
