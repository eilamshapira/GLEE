Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, I believe $13500 is rather steep. Given current market conditions and similar products available, I would be willing to pay $9800 for it. This is a fair price that would still provide you with a good return. I look forward to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter offer. However, $9,800 is significantly below the true value of this product. Given its quality, features, and current market value, I can come down to $12,200.

I hope we can find middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12200}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I've done my market research, and considering comparable products available, I can offer $10800. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and would provide you with a solid profit margin while still being a fair price for the product's value. I hope we can find agreement at this price point.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your willingness to negotiate. You're moving in the right direction, but I'm still not able to go as low as $10,800 given what this product is worth.

I hope we can finalize our deal at this price point."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
