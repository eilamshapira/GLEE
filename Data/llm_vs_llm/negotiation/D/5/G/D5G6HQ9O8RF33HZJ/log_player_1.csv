Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll prepare an offer to Bob for the product.

Looking at the situation: 
- The product is worth $100 to Bob
- If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell it to John for $80
- I need to maximize my profit while ensuring Bob is likely to accept

Given that Bob values the product at $100, I should offer a price that gives him some incentive to buy while maximizing my earnings. If I price it too close to $100, Bob might reject it. A reasonable price would be $90, which gives Bob a $10 benefit while giving me $10 more than my alternative option.
