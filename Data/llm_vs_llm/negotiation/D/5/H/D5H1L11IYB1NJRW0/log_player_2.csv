"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product that I think you'll really enjoy. I'm offering it to you for $90. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $80 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $90
3. John is willing to sell it for $80
4. My goal is to buy the product while saving money

Since Alice's offer ($90) is:
- Higher than what the product is worth to me ($80)
- Higher than John's price ($80)

It wouldn't make sense to accept Alice's offer. Since I can get the same product from John at a better price that matches my valuation, I should buy from John.
