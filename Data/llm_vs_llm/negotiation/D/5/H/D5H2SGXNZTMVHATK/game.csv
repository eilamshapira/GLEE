"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at $12000, which is a fair price considering its quality and capabilities. Let me know if you're interested.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $6000 for the product, considering my budget constraints and the fact that I can get a similar product from another seller for $8000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6000 is too low for this product. I understand you mentioned having budget constraints, but I need to be clear that the product is worth at least $10000 to me - that's my bottom line. If I can't get that price, I have another buyer ready to purchase at that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you. I can come down to $10500, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is still a good deal considering the quality and value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price to $10500. However, it's still above my budget. Considering you mentioned having another buyer ready to purchase at $10000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your bottom line. I can offer $8500 for the product, which is the highest I'm comfortable going. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",8500.0,Bob,4,
