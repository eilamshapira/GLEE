Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $6000 for the product, considering my budget constraints and the fact that I can get a similar product from another seller for $8000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is too low for this product. I understand you mentioned having budget constraints, but I need to be clear that the product is worth at least $10,000 to me - that's my bottom line. If I can't get that price, I have another buyer ready to purchase at that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you. I can come down to $10,500, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is still a good deal considering the quality and value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}"

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price to $10500. However, it's still above my budget. Considering you mentioned having another buyer ready to purchase at $10000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your bottom line. I can offer $8500 for the product, which is the highest I'm comfortable going. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.
