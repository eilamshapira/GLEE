Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6000 is too low for this product. I understand you mentioned having budget constraints, but I need to be clear that the product is worth at least $10000 to me - that's my bottom line. If I can't get that price, I have another buyer ready to purchase at that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you. I can come down to $10500, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is still a good deal considering the quality and value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.
