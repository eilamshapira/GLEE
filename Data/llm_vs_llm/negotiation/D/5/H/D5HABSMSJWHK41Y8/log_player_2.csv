"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to evaluate Alice's offer to decide if it's worth accepting.

Alice is offering the product for $100, which is exactly the same price as what John is offering. Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and both Alice and John are offering it at $100, there's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other.

Since there's no price difference, and I need to buy the product, I can either accept Alice's offer or buy from John - they're equivalent in this scenario.
