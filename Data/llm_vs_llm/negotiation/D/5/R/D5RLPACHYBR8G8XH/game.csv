,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $4000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering my needs. Let me know what you think!",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $4000 is significantly below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial price. How about $15000?  Let's try to find a middle ground.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $15000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $5500. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering we're both trying to find a middle ground. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",5500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $5500 is still far too low. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to be closer to my initial price.  How about $12500?  I'm feeling this is a fair offer that allows us both to make a deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to lower the price. However, $12500 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $6500. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",6500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $6500 just isn't enough for me to let this product go.  I'm trying to be fair here, but I'm also trying to make sure I get a reasonable price for something I value highly. How about $10000? This is a significant drop from my initial offer and a fair price for us both. Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your latest offer, and I can see that you're trying to meet me in the middle. However, $10000 is still a bit above what I'm willing to pay. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $7500. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",7500.0,Bob,8,
