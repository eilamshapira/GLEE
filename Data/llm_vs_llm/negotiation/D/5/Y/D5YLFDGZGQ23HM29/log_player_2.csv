"Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $16,000 is higher than both:
1. My maximum valuation ($12,000)
2. John's alternative offer ($12,000)

It would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. The best option is to buy from John at $12,000, which matches my maximum valuation and saves me $4,000 compared to Alice's offer.
