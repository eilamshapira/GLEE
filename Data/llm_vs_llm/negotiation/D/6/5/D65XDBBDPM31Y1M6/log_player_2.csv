"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000, and knowing that the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there might be room for negotiation to get an even better price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I'll start with a relatively low offer but not so low as to be insulting. I'll offer $900,000, which gives Alice a $100,000 profit while still saving me significantly compared to both Alice's initial offer and John's price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her price by $100,000 from her initial offer, showing she's willing to negotiate. The current offer of $1,100,000 is still $400,000 less than John's price. While we might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk that pushing too hard could make Alice less willing to negotiate. Given that this is a significant reduction from both the initial offer and John's price, I'll accept this offer.
