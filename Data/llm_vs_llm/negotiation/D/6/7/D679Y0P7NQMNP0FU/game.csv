,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13000, which still leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $13000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. I believe this is a reasonable price, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While $9500 is closer, it's still below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to go down to $11000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering your offer of $11000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. If we can't meet at this price, I may need to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other options.",10500.0,Alice,7,
