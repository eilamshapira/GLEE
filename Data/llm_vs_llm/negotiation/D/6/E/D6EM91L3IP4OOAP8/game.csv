"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product sounds interesting, but the price is a bit high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $850000 for it.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept $850000. This product delivers exceptional value at $950000, which is already a discount from its full market value of $1000000. However, I'm willing to meet you part way. I can offer it to you for $920000, which I believe is fair considering the product's quality and the value it will bring to your business. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I still feel that's a bit too high. Would you consider $880000? That's my final offer.",880000.0,Bob,4,
