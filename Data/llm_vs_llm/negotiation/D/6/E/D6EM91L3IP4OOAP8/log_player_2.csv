Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept $850000. This product delivers exceptional value at $950000, which is already a discount from its full market value of $1000000. However, I'm willing to meet you part way. I can offer it to you for $920000, which I believe is fair considering the product's quality and the value it will bring to your business. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.
