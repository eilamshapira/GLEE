"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $160. This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering you a fair price.",160.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe the product is of great value, but the price of $160 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, considering its quality and market value.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $100 is below what I can accept for it. The product is worth at least $120 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I can come down on my initial offer though - how about $140? This is still a fair price considering the product's quality.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that $100 was a bit low, but $140 is still higher than I'm comfortable paying. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'd like to propose a price of $110. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest. While I appreciate your offer of $110, I must remind you that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $120 for this product. That's the minimum value I can accept. If you can match $125, which is still a good deal compared to my initial offer, we can close this deal now. Otherwise, I may need to sell to John instead.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand that you have another buyer willing to pay $120, but I'm not willing to pay $125. I'm still interested in the product, and I'd like to propose a price of $115. This is closer to your minimum acceptable value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. If we can't agree on this price, I may need to consider buying from John at $120.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your offer of $115. However, as I mentioned, I already have John willing to pay $120, which is my minimum acceptable price. I'd like to be fair to you, but I also need to make a rational business decision. Since we're now in round 7 of our negotiation and John's offer is still available, I must insist on at least $120 - the same as John's offer - if we're to make a deal. At this point, I'm willing to sell to you at $120, which gives you the product at its fair value.",120.0,Alice,7,
