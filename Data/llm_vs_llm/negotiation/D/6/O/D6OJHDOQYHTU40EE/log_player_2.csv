Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe the product is of great value, but the price of $160 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, considering its quality and market value."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $100 is below what I can accept for it. The product is worth at least $120 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I can come down on my initial offer though - how about $140? This is still a fair price considering the product's quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest. While I appreciate your offer of $110, I must remind you that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $120 for this product. That's the minimum value I can accept. If you can match $125, which is still a good deal compared to my initial offer, we can close this deal now. Otherwise, I may need to sell to John instead. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

Round 6

I'm still interested in the product, and I'd like to propose a price of $115. This is closer to your minimum acceptable value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. If we can't agree on this price, I may need to consider buying from John at $120."", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your offer of $115. However, as I mentioned, I already have John willing to pay $120, which is my minimum acceptable price. I'd like to be fair to you, but I also need to make a rational business decision. Since we're now in round 7 of our negotiation and John's offer is still available, I must insist on at least $120 - the same as John's offer - if we're to make a deal. At this point, I'm willing to sell to you at $120, which gives you the product at its fair value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
