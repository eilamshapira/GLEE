"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to evaluate my best option here:

1. Accept Alice's offer of $20,000: This exceeds the $15,000 maximum value the product is worth to me, so this isn't a good choice.

2. Reject and make a counteroffer: This could potentially get me a better price than John's $15,000, but there's no guarantee.

3. Buy from John for $15,000: This is guaranteed, matches my maximum valuation, and saves me $5,000 compared to Alice's offer.

Since Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum valuation and John's guaranteed price, the most rational decision is to go with option 3.
