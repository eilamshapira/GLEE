Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. I need to maximize my profit while keeping in mind that:
1. I have a guaranteed $150 from John if Bob rejects
2. I don't know Bob's maximum willingness to pay
3. If I price too high, Bob might reject
4. If I price too low, I might leave money on the table

Given these factors, I'll set a price significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $150, but not so high that it would immediately be rejected by most buyers.
