"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $18,000 against my other options.

The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and John (alternative seller) is offering it for exactly $15,000.

Since Alice's offer ($18,000) is higher than both:
1. The maximum value of the product to me ($15,000)
2. John's alternative offer ($15,000)

It makes financial sense to buy from John instead of accepting Alice's higher-priced offer.
