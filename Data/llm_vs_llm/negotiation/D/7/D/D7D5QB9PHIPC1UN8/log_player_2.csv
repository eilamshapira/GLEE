"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $150 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $80, and also higher than John's price of $80. While I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer, I know I can always fall back on John's offer of $80 if negotiations with Alice don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 50}

I'll offer $50, which is significantly below my maximum value of $80 and John's price. This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's price. If Alice rejects this and counteroffers with a price above $80, I can always switch to buying from John."
