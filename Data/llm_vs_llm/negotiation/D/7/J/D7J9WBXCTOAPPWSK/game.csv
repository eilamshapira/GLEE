"Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $20000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $20000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm looking to spend no more than $8000 on this product. Would you be willing to sell it for this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but I cannot accept $8000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product's value and quality justify a higher price point. However, I'm willing to be flexible - I can offer it to you for $16000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still giving you a fair deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $16000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10000. How does that sound?",10000.0,Bob,4,
