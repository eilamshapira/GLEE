"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $20,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $20000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm looking to spend no more than $8000 on this product. Would you be willing to sell it for this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer in the next round as $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Perhaps we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but I cannot accept $8,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product's value and quality justify a higher price point. However, I'm willing to be flexible - I can offer it to you for $16,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still giving you a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $16000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10000. How does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and his incremental increase suggests he's unlikely to reach my minimum price point, I'll take John's guaranteed offer of $12,000."
