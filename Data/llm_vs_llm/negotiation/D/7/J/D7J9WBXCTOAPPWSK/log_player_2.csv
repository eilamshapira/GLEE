"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $20000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $20,000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm looking to spend no more than $8,000 on this product. Would you be willing to sell it for this price?"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob, but I cannot accept $8000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product's value and quality justify a higher price point. However, I'm willing to be flexible - I can offer it to you for $16000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still giving you a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $16,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10,000. How does that sound?"
