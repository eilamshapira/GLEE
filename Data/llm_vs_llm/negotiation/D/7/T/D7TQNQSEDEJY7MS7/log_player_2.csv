"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $30,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $30,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","The price Alice is offering ($30,000) is way above the product's value to me, which is no more than $12,000. It's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $12,000. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer that's below John's price, or at least consider buying from John directly.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
