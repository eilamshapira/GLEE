"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm setting the price at $12000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its quality and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000, and it's also higher than John's price of $8,000. It would not be rational to accept this offer as it would result in a loss for me. Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value point ($8,000), and Alice's initial offer is too high, the best decision would be to buy from John rather than continue negotiations with Alice.
