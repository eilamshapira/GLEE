"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price offered by Alice ($120) is higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). It would be rational to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations with Alice don't lead to a better price, I can always fall back on John's offer of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $120, but not so low as to be insulting. Since my maximum value is $100 and I want to save money, I'll start with a lower price to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 80}

This counteroffer of $80 leaves room for negotiation while still being a reasonable starting point. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground, and I still have John's $100 offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $100 because:
1. It matches my maximum value ($100)
2. It's equal to John's price ($100)
3. There's no guarantee that Alice would accept a lower price
4. Further negotiation might lead to Alice increasing the price again
5. We've already seen Alice reduce her price significantly from $120 to $100

Since we've reached a price that equals both my maximum value and the alternative option (John's price), it's rational to accept this offer now rather than risk further negotiations."
