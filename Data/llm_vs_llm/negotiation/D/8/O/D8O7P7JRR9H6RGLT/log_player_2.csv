"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,500,000
2. Alice's initial offer is $1,200,000
3. I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice
4. I have 10 rounds to negotiate
5. John's fixed price of $1,500,000 is my backup option

Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is already better than John's price, but there's room for negotiation since I know Alice's cost is $1,000,000. It's reasonable to try to negotiate for a better price, and I still have 9 rounds left after this one. If negotiations fail, I can always go back to John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's cost is $1,000,000 and her initial offer was $1,200,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's still profitable for her but better for me. I'll start with a price closer to her cost to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 1050000}

This offer would still give Alice a $50,000 profit while saving me a significant amount compared to both her initial offer and John's price. If she rejects this, we can likely meet somewhere in the middle between $1,050,000 and $1,200,000 in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze the updated situation:

1. The negotiation has progressed well:
   - Alice's first offer: $1,200,000
   - My counteroffer: $1,050,000
   - Alice's new offer: $1,150,000

2. Alice has moved down $50,000 from her initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
3. $1,150,000 is significantly better than John's price of $1,500,000
4. While there might be room for further negotiation, the current offer is quite reasonable:
   - It's $350,000 less than John's price
   - It gives Alice a $150,000 profit margin
   - We still have 7 rounds left, but pushing too hard might risk the deal

Given that this is a fair middle ground and represents a good savings compared to my maximum price, I'll accept this offer.
