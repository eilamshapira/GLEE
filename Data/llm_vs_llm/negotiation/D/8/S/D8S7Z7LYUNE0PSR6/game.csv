"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $25000. This is a competitive price for the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $25000 is a bit out of my budget range. I can offer $10000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $10000 is too low for this product. Given its value and quality, I can come down to $22000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. Would you be interested in this revised offer?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand where you're coming from. However, I have a limited budget for this product. I am willing to increase my offer to $12500. I hope we can find a price that works for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
