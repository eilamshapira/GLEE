Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $25,000. This is a competitive price for the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $25000 is a bit out of my budget range. I can offer $10000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Even John is offering more than this, so there's no reason to accept such a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is too low for this product. Given its value and quality, I can come down to $22,000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. Would you be interested in this revised offer?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand where you're coming from. However, I have a limited budget for this product. I am willing to increase my offer to $12500. I hope we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer is still below John's guaranteed offer of $15,000, and Bob's incremental increase suggests he may not be willing to go much higher, it's best to take the sure deal with John rather than continue negotiations that might not reach my minimum acceptable price."
