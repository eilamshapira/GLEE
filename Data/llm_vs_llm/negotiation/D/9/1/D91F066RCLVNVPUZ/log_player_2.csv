"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $9,500 is close to my maximum budget of $10,000, but I still have room to negotiate and potentially save some money, I'll choose to reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, I'll start by offering a price that is slightly higher than that, to leave room for further negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $9,200 is a slight decrease from her initial offer, but it's still close to my maximum budget. Since I know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to make a more reasonable counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 2, I offered $8,500, which was rejected by Alice. Now, I'll try to meet Alice halfway between my previous offer and her new offer of $9,200. I'll make a counteroffer of $8,800, which is slightly higher than my previous offer, but still lower than Alice's current offer.

{""product_price"": 8800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $9,000 is getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since I've already invested time in negotiating with Alice, I'll try to reject her offer again and make another counteroffer. However, I'll keep in mind that I don't want to overplay my hand and risk losing the deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 5, Alice's offer was $9,000, and my previous counteroffer was $8,800. To try to meet Alice halfway, I'll increase my counteroffer by $100, making it $8,900. This is a small concession on my part, and I hope it will be enough to persuade Alice to accept my offer.

{""product_price"": 8900}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,995. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,995
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $8,995 is very close to my maximum budget of $10,000, and it's also close to the price I was hoping to pay. Considering that Alice's initial offer was $9,500 and we've been negotiating for several rounds, I think $8,995 is a reasonable price. I'll accept Alice's offer, as it's only $5 more than my previous counteroffer of $8,990 (which I didn't make, but would have been my next step) and $1,005 less than John's offer.
