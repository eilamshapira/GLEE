# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality and unique features of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000.
