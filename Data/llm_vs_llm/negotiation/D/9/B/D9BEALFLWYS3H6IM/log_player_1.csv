Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer, considering that Bob values the product at $10,000 and I can always fall back to John's $8,000 offer.

{""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,500 is better than John's $8,000, and considering we might risk losing Bob if we push too hard, I'll continue negotiating but with a lower counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll now make a counteroffer of $9,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still gives me a good profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 9000}"
