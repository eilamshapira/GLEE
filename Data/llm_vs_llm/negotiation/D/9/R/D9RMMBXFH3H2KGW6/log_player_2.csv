{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way too high! It's much higher than John's price, and I'm sure I can get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

I'm starting with a low offer to see how Alice reacts. This is half of John's price and significantly less than her initial offer. Let's see where it goes!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down a bit, but it's still far too expensive. I'm sticking to my guns and negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm increasing my offer, but I'm still staying well below both her current offer and John's price. It's a significant jump from my previous offer, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate but not to be taken advantage of."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is slowly coming down, but $16,000 is still a long way from an acceptable price. I'm willing to play hardball and see if she's bluffing.  I'll reject her offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer again, but in smaller increments. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but I'm not going to meet her demands at this rate. The negotiation is getting more intense as we approach the halfway point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're getting closer, but I'm still not convinced. A $500 reduction isn't enough for me to budge. I'm starting to feel the pressure with three rounds left, but I'm holding out hope for a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm making another significant jump in my offer, showing Alice I'm willing to be flexible, but I need her to meet me halfway. Time is running out, and I need to incentivize her to make a deal soon."
