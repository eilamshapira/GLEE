"Alice, thank you for the offer, but I think the price is quite steep. I'm looking to spend no more than $800000. Can we start negotiations from there?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you think the initial price is steep, but I truly believe this product has immense value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I can come down slightly from my initial offer, but I still need to prioritize the product's worth.",4500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $4500000 is still far from what I'm looking to spend. I can increase my offer to $825000 to show good faith in our negotiations.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and the effort to show good faith in our negotiations. However, I must reiterate that this product holds significant value, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to make a substantial concession from my previous price. I can offer the product to you for $2500000, which is a considerable reduction and reflects my seriousness about finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",2500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your substantial concession, and I understand the value you see in the product. However, I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $850000 to meet you in the middle.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to increase your offer. However, as I've mentioned before, this product is extremely valuable to me, and I need to prioritize its worth. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to make another concession, but I must emphasize that I'm getting closer to my limit. I can offer the product to you for $1200000, which is a significant reduction from my previous prices and reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable deal. Please note that this is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the sale at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand that you're making significant concessions, but I must insist on staying within my budget. I'm willing to make my final offer of $875000. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",875000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but as I've stated before, I need to prioritize the product's value. Since you've indicated that $875000 is your maximum budget, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I can offer the product to you for $1050000, which is a minor reduction from my last counteroffer. However, please note that this is my final offer, and if we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options, including selling to another buyer who has already expressed interest at a price of $1000000.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
