"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but I think the price is quite steep. I'm looking to spend no more than $800000. Can we start negotiations from there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $800,000 is below my target price, and I believe the product is worth more. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is an option, but I'd like to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you think the initial price is steep, but I truly believe this product has immense value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $4500000 is still far from what I'm looking to spend. I can increase my offer to $825000 to show good faith in our negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's increased offer to $825,000 shows he's interested, but it's still significantly lower than my initial price and what I believe the product is worth. Since $825,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, I'll continue to negotiate with Bob to see if we can meet at a higher price point. I'll make another counteroffer in the hopes of finding a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and the effort to show good faith in our negotiations. However, I must reiterate that this product holds significant value, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to make a substantial concession from my previous price. I can offer the product to you for $2,500,000, which is a considerable reduction and reflects my seriousness about finding a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 2500000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your substantial concession, and I understand the value you see in the product. However, I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $850000 to meet you in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and significantly lower than my last counteroffer of $2,500,000. While I appreciate his efforts to meet in the middle, the gap between our prices is substantial. Given that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer, I'll continue to negotiate with Bob to see if he's willing to increase his offer further. I'll make another counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to increase your offer. However, as I've mentioned before, this product is extremely valuable to me, and I need to prioritize its worth. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to make another concession, but I must emphasize that I'm getting closer to my limit. I can offer the product to you for $1,200,000, which is a significant reduction from my previous prices and reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable deal. Please note that this is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the sale at this price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's final offer of $875,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Given that this is his final offer and he's unwilling to budge further, I don't see a point in continuing to negotiate at a price that's not favorable to me. Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's final offer, I'll consider ending the negotiation with Bob and exploring the option with John. However, I'll make one last attempt to negotiate with Bob before making a final decision."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but as I've stated before, I need to prioritize the product's value. Since you've indicated that $875,000 is your maximum budget, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I can offer the product to you for $1,050,000, which is a minor reduction from my last counteroffer. However, please note that this is my final offer, and if we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options, including selling to another buyer who has already expressed interest at a price of $1,000,000."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
