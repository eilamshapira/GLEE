Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value you place on this product, I have a limited budget. I'm willing to offer $900000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $900,000 is lower than I'm willing to accept, and I believe the product is worth more. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is an option, but I'd like to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you have a budget in mind, but I still believe the product is worth more than $900,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering a reduction, Alice. To move closer to a deal within my budget constraints, I can offer $1000000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the same price I can get from John, but I still believe the product is worth more. Since I have the option to sell to John for the same price, I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer immediately. I'll make another counteroffer to see if Bob is willing to increase his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid to $1,000,000. However, I'm still convinced that the product's value exceeds this amount. I'm willing to make a significant concession to facilitate a deal, but I need to see a bit more movement from your side. I'll reduce my price, but not to $1,000,000 just yet."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, Alice. To try and reach common ground, I'd like to offer $1100000. I'm very committed to making this purchase while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is an improvement, but it's still below my target price. Since I've already reduced my offer significantly in the previous rounds, I'd like to see if Bob is willing to meet me closer to my desired price. I'll make another counteroffer to try and bridge the gap. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is still an option, but I'm willing to take a bit more risk to try and get a better price from Bob."
