"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product.  Given its unique features, I'm initially offering it at $20000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point, but I'm open to discussing what's important to you.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the unique features of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $12000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $16000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $16000 is still a bit above my budget. Considering your previous offer and my initial counteroffer, I'd like to propose a compromise at $13500. I believe this is a reasonable price that takes into account both our perspectives.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on finding a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $13500 is cutting it too close. Would you consider $14500? I believe this reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to work with me on the price. $14500 is closer to my budget, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle between your current offer and my previous one. Would you consider $14000? I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and my budget constraints.",14000.0,Bob,6,
