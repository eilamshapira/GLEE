"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase this product, but I need a more reasonable price. I'm offering $750000, which I believe is a fair value for this asset.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, but $750000 is significantly below its inherent value. While I can't accept that, I'm willing to come down. How about $2250000?",2250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $2250000 is still above what I'm willing to pay. I'm serious about purchasing this product and willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer isn't feasible, but I can increase my offer. I'm offering $900000, which I believe is a more reasonable price for this asset.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer. I am also serious about selling this product to you. However, I cannot accept $900000. My absolute lowest offer would be $2000000. I am confident that this price reflects the true value of the asset and the opportunity it presents.",2000000.0,Alice,5,
