Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. 

Since I know I have a guaranteed $800,000 from John if Bob rejects my offer, I can be relatively aggressive with my pricing to Bob. I want to price it high enough to maximize my potential profit, but not so high that Bob will definitely reject it.

Given that I don't know Bob's valuation, but I know he's interested enough to consider purchasing, I'll aim significantly higher than my minimum price of $800,000, but not so extreme as to be unreasonable.
