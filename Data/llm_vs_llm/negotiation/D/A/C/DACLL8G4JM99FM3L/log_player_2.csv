"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12000. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with the purchase! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer of $12,000 is below my maximum budget of $15,000, I have room to potentially negotiate a better price. However, $12,000 is also a reasonable price, and I don't know if Alice will be willing to lower it further. Given that I have the option to buy from John for $15,000, which is my maximum budget, I'll try to negotiate with Alice to see if I can get a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable, to see if she's willing to negotiate. Since I don't know the minimum price Alice is willing to accept, I'll start by offering a price that is $1,000 lower than her initial offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I can meet you halfway. How about $11500? Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has made a counteroffer of $11,500, which is still below my maximum budget of $15,000. However, I was hoping to get a better deal, and $11,500 is only $500 lower than her previous offer. Since I've already made one counteroffer, I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer that is lower than Alice's current offer, but still reasonable. Since Alice met me halfway last time, I'll try to split the difference again. The difference between my previous offer of $11,000 and Alice's current offer of $11,500 is $500. I'll offer $11,250, which is $250 above my previous offer and $250 below Alice's current offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,250. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 11250}"
