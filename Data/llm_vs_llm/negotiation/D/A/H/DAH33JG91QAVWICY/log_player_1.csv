Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think of my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate that you're open to negotiation. While the product looks great, I've seen similar items selling for less. Would you consider $90 for the product? This would be a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price. My counteroffer will be $100. This price is still lower than my initial offer, but higher than Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate while trying to get a better deal. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your point about similar items selling for less, but I believe my product has some unique features that make it more valuable. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?""}"
