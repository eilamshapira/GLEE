Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but my budget is a bit lower. How about a counteroffer of $7000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, trying to find a mutually beneficial price. Since the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, I'll aim to get closer to my initial offer while still being open to negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that my initial price might have been a bit steep, but I still believe the product's value lies closer to my first offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a slight adjustment.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since he's increasing his offer, it shows he's interested in the product. I'll try to meet him closer to the middle but still aim to get a price that's more favorable to me. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer of $9,000, which is a bit lower than my previous offer but still reflects the product's value to me."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I see you're serious about acquiring the product, and I appreciate your persistence.
