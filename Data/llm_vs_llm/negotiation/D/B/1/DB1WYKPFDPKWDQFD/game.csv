"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would need to be a steal for me to consider going above my budget. I'm willing to offer $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I must emphasize that this product's value far exceeds $80. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Here's a revised offer.",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a firm budget.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $220 is still much higher than I'm willing to spend.  If you can come down closer to my range, I'm interested in finding a deal.  How about $95?",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm starting to understand your budget constraints, but I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to make another compromise to meet you halfway. Here's a revised offer.",200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $200 is still much too high for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer. Would you consider $105?",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see that we're making progress, and I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, I still believe the product's value exceeds $105. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Here's a revised offer.",180.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to think we might not find common ground here.  $180 is still significantly higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $115, which is a big jump from my previous offer.  Let me know if that works for you, otherwise I might need to explore other options.",115.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate the significant increase in your offer. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $115. I'm willing to make one more compromise to try to find common ground. Here's a revised offer.",165.0,Alice,9,
