"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. While I have another buyer interested at $120, I wanted to give you the first opportunity. I can offer it to you for $100, which would give you a good value while still being fair to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
