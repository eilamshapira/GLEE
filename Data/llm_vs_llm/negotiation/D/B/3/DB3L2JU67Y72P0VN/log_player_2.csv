"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,500,000), and I don't know the value of the product to Alice, I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, to test the waters and see how flexible she is on the price.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the market value of similar products."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
