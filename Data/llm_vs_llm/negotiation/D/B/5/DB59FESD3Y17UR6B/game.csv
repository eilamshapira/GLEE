"Hello Alice, thank you for offering this product. While I appreciate the value it holds, your asking price is a bit higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1000000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a price that reflects its true value. I'd be willing to consider a serious offer, but $1000000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can offer you a price of $1650000, which I believe is more reasonable.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. Meeting in the middle is a good idea, but I was thinking more along the lines of meeting closer to my original price. I can offer you a price of $1600000, which I believe is a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, but $1600000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $1250000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair offer considering your next best option.",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. I understand that $1600000 is still a bit out of your range. Considering your offer of $1250000, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. I can offer you a price of $1550000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
