"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to consider that?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to lower the price to $160. This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you lowering the price to $160, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable paying that much. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer of $100 and your new offer of $160. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
