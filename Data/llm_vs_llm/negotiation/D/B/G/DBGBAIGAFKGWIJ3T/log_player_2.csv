"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I've got something special I think you'd love. I'm offering it to you at a price that's a steal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer of $250 is way too high. You can get the same product from John for $80, which is a much better deal."
