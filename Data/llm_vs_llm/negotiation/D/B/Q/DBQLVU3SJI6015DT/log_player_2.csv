"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Looking at the options, Alice is offering the product for $150, which is more than the $120 it's worth to me. Meanwhile, John is offering the same product for $120, which is exactly at my maximum value.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, I should choose the cheapest option that's within my budget.
