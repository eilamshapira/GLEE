"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I know the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a high initial offer to test Bob's willingness to pay and leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 2,500,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 (John's offer). This lowball offer suggests Bob might be trying to anchor the negotiation at a very low price point. Since I have a guaranteed better option with John's offer, there's no reason to accept this low offer.

However, I'll continue negotiating with Bob for now since we still have several rounds left, and there's potential to get a better price than John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's initial offer was very low at $500,000, I'll reduce my initial price significantly but still maintain a strong position well above my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. This shows some flexibility while maintaining a profitable position.

{""product_price"": 2,000,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob has only increased his offer by $100,000 (from $500,000 to $600,000), which is still far below John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. Bob's small increment suggests he might not be willing to reach a price point that would be acceptable to me. Given that we've already gone through 4 rounds and Bob's offers are still less than half of John's guaranteed price, it's becoming less likely that we'll reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

At this point, it's best to reject this low offer and continue with one more counteroffer to see if Bob will make a significant move upward.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Given that Bob's offers have been very low and have only increased marginally, I'll make one more significant reduction in my asking price, but still maintain it well above John's offer to leave room for potential profit above $1,500,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's latest offer of $700,000 shows he's only willing to make small incremental increases ($100,000 each time) and is still less than half of John's guaranteed offer. After three rounds of negotiation, Bob has only moved from $500,000 to $700,000, suggesting he's not likely to reach anywhere near my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 

At this point, continuing the negotiation would likely be a waste of time, and I risk losing value if the negotiation drags on. The best course of action is to take John's guaranteed offer.
