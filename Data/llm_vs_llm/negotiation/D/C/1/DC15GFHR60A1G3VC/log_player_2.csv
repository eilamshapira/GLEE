"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $100. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $80
2. Alice is offering the product for $100
3. John is offering the product for $80

Since Alice's price ($100) is higher than both:
- my maximum value ($80)
- John's alternative price ($80)

It makes the most sense to buy from John. I'll save $20 compared to Alice's offer, and get the product at exactly my maximum value.
