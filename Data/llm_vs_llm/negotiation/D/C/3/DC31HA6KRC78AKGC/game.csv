"Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $8000 is too low for this product's value. I can come down from my initial price, but I would need $10500 for this product. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it better reflects the true value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
