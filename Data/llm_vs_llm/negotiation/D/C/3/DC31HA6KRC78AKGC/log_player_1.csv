Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it for $12,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob is showing interest and willing to negotiate, I'll make a counteroffer. The fact that he's starting at $8,000 (which is my minimum acceptable price) suggests there might be room for negotiation upward. It's better to continue negotiating with Bob for potentially higher profit than immediately settling for $8,000 (whether from Bob or John)."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $8,000 is too low for this product's value. I can come down from my initial price, but I would need $10,500 for this product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the reduction, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $9,500. This is a good price that's significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 (and John's standing offer). Bob has shown good faith in negotiations by making a substantial increase from his initial offer, and there's a risk that pushing too hard might cause him to walk away, leaving me with only John's $8,000 offer. A profit of $9,500 is a satisfactory outcome."
