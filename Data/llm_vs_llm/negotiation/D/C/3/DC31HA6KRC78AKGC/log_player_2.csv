"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it for $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's initial offer is $12,000, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and I also have the option to buy the product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in accepting Alice's offer immediately without trying to negotiate a better price.

Therefore, my decision is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send Alice a counteroffer, hoping to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, to see how she reacts and to leave room for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $8000 is too low for this product's value. I can come down from my initial price, but I would need $10500 for this product. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it better reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has come down from her initial price of $12,000 to $10,500, which is a significant reduction. However, I'm still hoping to get a better deal.

Since Alice has already reduced the price by $1,500, I'm going to try to negotiate further. I'll make another counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one, but still lower than Alice's current offer.

My decision is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send Alice a counteroffer of $9,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(Note: I'll send the counteroffer in the next message)
