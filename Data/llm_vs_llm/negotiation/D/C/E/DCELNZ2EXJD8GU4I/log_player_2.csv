"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product at $250. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think about this logically:

1. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
2. Alice's offer is $250, which is way above my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $120, which is exactly my maximum value
4. Even if I make a counteroffer to Alice, I already know I can get it for $120 from John
5. There's no point in accepting Alice's $250 offer as it's more than double my maximum value

Since Alice's initial offer is so high ($250), and I can definitely get the product from John for $120, which matches my maximum value, there's no reason to even continue negotiating with Alice.
