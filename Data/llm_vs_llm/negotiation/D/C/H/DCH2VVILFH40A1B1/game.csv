"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $2300000 is significantly above my budget. Given that I can get the same product elsewhere for much less, I'd like to offer $800000. This is a fair price that would allow both of us to benefit from this transaction.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I must be candid, $800000 is considerably below the market value of this product.  I've done my research, and its unique features and potential justify a higher price point. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1900000. This offer represents a significant discount from my initial ask and reflects my genuine interest in finding a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you reducing your price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $1000000. Given this market reality, I'm willing to increase my offer to $850000. This is still a premium over what I could pay elsewhere, reflecting my interest in doing business with you specifically. However, I cannot justify paying nearly double what another seller is offering.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have other options, but I believe comparing solely on price overlooks the unique value my product offers.  To find a solution, I'm willing to consider a significant compromise.  How about we settle at $1500000? This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I can go while ensuring a fair deal.  ",1500000.0,Alice,5,
