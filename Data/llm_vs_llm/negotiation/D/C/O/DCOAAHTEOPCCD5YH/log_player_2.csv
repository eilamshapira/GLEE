"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $80. Let me know if you're interested in purchasing it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($80), and I can get the same product from John for the same price, I don't see any benefit in accepting Alice's offer immediately. I'll try to negotiate or explore other options.
