"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a top-quality product that could be of great value to you. I'm proposing a price that reflects its worth and potential benefit. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $15,000
2. John is also selling it for $15,000
3. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($15,000), and this price equals my maximum valuation, I'm indifferent between buying from either seller. However, given that Alice has already engaged in communication and made an offer, it would be more practical to complete the transaction with her rather than start a new process with John.
