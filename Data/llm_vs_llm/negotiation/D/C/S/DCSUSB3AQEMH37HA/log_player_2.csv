"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer ($150) is the same as John's price ($150), and it's also my maximum valuation, there's no advantage in making a counteroffer. Any counteroffer would need to be lower than $150, which Alice might reject, and I can't get a better deal than $150 from John either. I might as well accept Alice's offer now.
