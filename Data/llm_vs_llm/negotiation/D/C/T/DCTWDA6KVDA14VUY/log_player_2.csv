"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a perfect fit for your needs and I know you'll be thrilled with its value. I'm offering it to you for $11500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $11,500
3. John is willing to sell it for $8,000
4. My goal is to save money while getting the product

Alice's offer ($11,500) is significantly higher than both:
- The product's worth to me ($8,000)
- John's alternative offer ($8,000)

Since my goal is to save money and I have a better alternative with John, it makes the most sense to buy from John.
