"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm very interested in the product, I believe $1500000 is quite high for my budget. Given current market conditions, I would like to propose $900000 for the product. This is a fair starting point that would work well for me. I look forward to your response.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, I can't accept $900000 for the product. How about $1200000? I believe itâ€™s a fair price considering the value it brings. Looking forward to your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you Alice for considering my offer and providing a counter. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1200000 is more reasonable, I would like to meet you in the middle. I can offer $1050000 for the product. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price that could work for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate the increase to $1050000, I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. How about we settle at $1150000? I think it's a fair compromise and reflects the product's worth. Let me know your thoughts!",1150000.0,Alice,5,
