"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget and the guaranteed price from John. It makes strategic sense to negotiate down from this point rather than accepting such a high initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $5,000} 

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, aiming to establish a lower baseline for the negotiation. It leaves room to negotiate upwards while still being significantly below my maximum budget."
