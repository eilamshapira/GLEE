"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $7000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $7000 is significantly below the product's value. I can offer it to you for $15000, which is a considerable reduction from my initial offer. Let me know if this works for you.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. $15000 is still too high for me. I understand the product has value, but my maximum budget is $8500. Could you meet me there?",8500.0,Bob,4,
