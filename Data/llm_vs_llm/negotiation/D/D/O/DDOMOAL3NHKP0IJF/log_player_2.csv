{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you know the product is worth to John.  It makes sense to negotiate down significantly."

{
 ""product_price"": 725000

}

We're increasing the offer again, but staying firm below $800,000. This signals to Alice that we're serious about the price ceiling and running out of room to negotiate.  It's a final attempt to see if she's willing to come down significantly."
