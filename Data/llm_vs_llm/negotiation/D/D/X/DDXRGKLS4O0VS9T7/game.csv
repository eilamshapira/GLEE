"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. Although I'm interested in the product, I find $25000 to be a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10000, considering the market value and my own financial constraints.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $10000 is lower than I can accept. I understand budget constraints, but the product's value is significant. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower the price to $22500.",22500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and lower the price to $22500. However, it's still a bit out of my reach. Considering my budget and the fact that I have alternative options, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $12000. This is the highest I'm comfortable paying, and I believe it's a fair price given the market conditions.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your continued interest and counteroffer. While $12000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to continue negotiating. I can come down a bit more. How about $20000?",20000.0,Alice,5,
