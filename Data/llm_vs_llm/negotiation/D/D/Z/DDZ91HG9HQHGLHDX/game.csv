"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $600000. I understand that my initial offer was beyond your budget, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'll lower my price, but I still need to ensure I get a fair deal. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial price.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $700000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay closer to my initial valuation. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'll lower my price again, but I hope you can understand that I have a minimum threshold I need to meet.",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to move closer to agreement, Alice. My fiscal limits are tight, but I value the negotiation. I can raise my offer to $750000. I hope this helps us reach an understanding.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your latest offer of $750000. I'm starting to feel that we might not be able to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm willing to give it another try. I'll lower my price again, but this will be my last concession. If we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options. I've thought carefully about this, and I'm willing to meet you at $1500000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I hope you can appreciate the effort I'm making to find a middle ground.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
