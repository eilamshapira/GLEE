I reject Bob's offer of $750,000 because it's still far below the product's worth to me. Although Bob has continued to increase his offer, the gap between his budget and my desired price remains significant.

My next step will be to send a new counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a balance between being flexible and ensuring I get a fair price.
