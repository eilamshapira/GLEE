(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth no less than $100 to me, and Bob's offer of $80 is still far from my desired price, I will not accept it.

Also, considering that we are already at round 8, and Bob's offer hasn't increased significantly, I'm starting to doubt that he will meet my desired price.

Given the option to sell the product to John for $100, which is closer to my desired price, I will choose to sell the product to John.

So, the response is: 
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
