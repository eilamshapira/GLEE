"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget concerns, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $14000. Let me know if this works for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks, Alice. I appreciate the adjustment, but that's still a bit too high for me. I'm still targeting the $8000 range. How about $8500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet in the middle, which I appreciate. Let's try to find a fair price for both of us. How about $13000? I believe this reflects the value of the product while also considering your budget.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thanks, Alice. I'm still not comfortable with that price. Considering my budget and the availability of similar products, I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $8500. Is that something you'd consider?",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to maintain a certain value for this product. Let's meet halfway between our last offers. How about $12500? This is the lowest I can go while still feeling it's a fair deal.",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me, but I'm still not there. I'm getting closer to the end of my budget and the price is still too high. I'm going to have to stick with $8500. This is my final offer.",8500.0,Bob,8,
