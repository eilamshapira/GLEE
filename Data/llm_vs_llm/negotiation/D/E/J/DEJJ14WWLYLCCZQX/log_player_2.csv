"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to consider my options carefully here. Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than my maximum valuation of $10,000. In fact, it's $8,000 more than what I'm willing to pay. John is offering the product at exactly my maximum valuation of $10,000.

Since Alice's initial offer is so high, I should reject it and make a counteroffer. There's potential to negotiate a better price than John's $10,000 offer, which I can always fall back on if negotiations with Alice don't go well.

Since Alice's offer is still higher than the guaranteed alternative from John, I should continue negotiating.
