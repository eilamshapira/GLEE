"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price point that is a bit lower. How about we settle for $900000? This way, both of us can walk away from the deal feeling satisfied.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's value to both of us, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $1100000, which is still a competitive price. I'm open to further negotiations, but I believe this price is more in line with the product's worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice. However, I think we can still find a middle ground that works for both of us. What about settling for $975000? This price considers your valuation while also allowing me to make a sensible purchase.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I still believe that $975000 is slightly below the product's true value. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $1075000. This price is closer to the middle ground we're both seeking, and I'm confident that it's a fair deal for both parties.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"We're getting closer to an agreement, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. To bridge the gap, how about we settle for $1000000? This price acknowledges the product's value to you while also meeting my budget constraints.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I see we're very close to an agreement, Bob. While $1000000 is a reasonable offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to the product's true value. Considering we're already at this price point, I'm willing to make a small compromise and offer it to you for $1050000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to finalize the deal at this amount.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
