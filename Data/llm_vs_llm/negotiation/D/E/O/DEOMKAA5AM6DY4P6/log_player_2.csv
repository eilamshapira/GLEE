"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given the information, Alice's offer of $200 is significantly higher than both:
1. The maximum value of the product to me ($120)
2. John's fixed offer of $120

Since I can get the product from John for $120, and this matches the maximum value the product has to me, there's no reason to accept Alice's higher offer or continue negotiating.
