"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'll get from the product.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I can't sell for $90 as that's below my minimum threshold. I have another buyer willing to pay $100, but I'd prefer to work with you. I can come down to $120, which is still a great value considering the product is worth $150 to you.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for being transparent about your minimum threshold. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking we could meet in the middle between your minimum threshold of $100 and your current offer of $120. I'd like to propose $110 as a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
