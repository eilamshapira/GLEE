Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider the best price to offer Bob, balancing between maximizing my profit and ensuring the sale isn't rejected.

Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price, I don't want to go below that amount. However, I also want to try to get more from Bob if possible.

Given that I don't know how much the product is worth to Bob, I'll set a price that gives me a reasonable premium over my minimum acceptable value, but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected.
