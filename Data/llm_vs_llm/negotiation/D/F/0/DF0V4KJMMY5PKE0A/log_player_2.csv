"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll analyze this situation:

- The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me (Bob)
- Alice is offering to sell it to me for $1,950,000
- John is offering to sell the same product for $1,200,000

Since Alice's offer ($1,950,000) is significantly higher than the product's worth to me ($1,200,000) and also higher than John's offer ($1,200,000), it makes the most economic sense to buy from John instead.
