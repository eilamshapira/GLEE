"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 180} 

This is a starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential for negotiation. It's significantly higher than my minimum and his perceived value, leaving room for bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  We're still far from finding a compromise. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 160}

I'm coming down from my initial offer, but still aiming for a price that is significantly above Bob's valuation. This shows a willingness to negotiate but also emphasizes the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's still too far below my minimum. I need to show him I'm willing to walk away to secure a better price.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 145}

This offer is a calculated risk. I'm getting closer to my minimum but leaving a small margin for error. This signals to Bob that I'm serious about selling but not desperate enough to accept a lowball offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob is not moving significantly towards a price that's worthwhile for me. It's becoming clear that reaching a mutually agreeable price with him is unlikely. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
