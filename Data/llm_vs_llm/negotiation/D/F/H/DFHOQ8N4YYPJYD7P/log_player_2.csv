"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than the product's worth to me (no more than $1,500,000) and also higher than John's guaranteed price of $1,500,000. It would not make financial sense to accept this offer.

I could reject and make a counteroffer, but since John is already willing to sell the product at exactly my maximum value ($1,500,000), and Alice values the product at $1,500,000 as well, it's unlikely we could negotiate a deal that would be better than John's offer.
