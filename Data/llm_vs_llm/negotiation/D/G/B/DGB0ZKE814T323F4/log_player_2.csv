"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer ($175) is higher than both my maximum value ($150) and John's price ($150), there's no reason to accept this offer. Also, since I can always buy from John at $150, I should try to negotiate with Alice for a better price first.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's cost is $150 and that's also my maximum value, I'll start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation, but not too low to be unreasonable.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's offer of $160 is still above both my maximum value ($150) and John's price ($150). There's no reason to accept this offer when I can get it cheaper from John. However, I'll try one more negotiation round since Alice has shown willingness to lower the price significantly.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has moved down from $175 to $160, showing willingness to negotiate, and since her cost is $150, I'll make a slightly higher offer than my previous one but still below John's price.
