"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I certainly understand Bob's perspective, but I believe the product's value is higher than that.

**My counteroffer:**
{""product_price"": 13000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 13000}

Bob, I understand that you see the value of the product at $10,000, but I believe it's worth more. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product for $13,000. This way, we both get a good deal."
