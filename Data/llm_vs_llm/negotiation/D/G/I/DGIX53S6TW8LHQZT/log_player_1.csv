Send your offer to Bob.,"Analyzing the situation:

1. The product is worth at least $15,000 to me (Alice)
2. The product is worth $8,000 to Bob
3. If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000
4. Bob will only accept if the price is less than or equal to what it's worth to him ($8,000)

Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 (which matches my minimum value), and Bob values it less than that, there's no rational reason for me to offer Bob a price below $15,000.
