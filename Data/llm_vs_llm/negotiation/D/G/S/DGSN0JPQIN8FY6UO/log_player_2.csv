"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an exclusive offer for you on this exceptional product. Its value is immense, and I'm offering it to you for just $10000. This product is a great investment and can offer you substantial benefits. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $10,000
2. John is also offering the product for $10,000
3. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($10,000), and this equals my maximum valuation, I'm indifferent between the two sellers. However, since there's an option to reject and the deal doesn't seem particularly advantageous (I'm paying my maximum value), I should reject and try to negotiate for a better price.
