"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $90 compared to my alternatives.

The product is worth at most $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $90, which exceeds its value to me. John is willing to sell the same product for $80, which matches the maximum I'm willing to pay.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and John's offer is $10 cheaper than Alice's, the rational choice is clear.
