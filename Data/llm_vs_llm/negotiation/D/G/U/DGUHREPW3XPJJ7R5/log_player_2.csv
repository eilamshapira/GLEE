"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in purchasing the product. I believe it's a valuable investment and am willing to sell it to you. Given the market value and potential benefits, I'd like to offer it to you for $1400000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's guaranteed price ($800,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. While I could make a counteroffer, since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value, and there's no guarantee Alice would go below this price (given that the product is worth $1,200,000 to her), the most rational decision is to buy from John.
