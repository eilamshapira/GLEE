"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $20000 is far beyond my budget and the value I see. Considering my alternatives, I'm prepared to offer $9000 for the product. Please let me know if this works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest, but $9000 undervalues the quality and uniqueness of this product. Considering its merits, I'm willing to make a counteroffer at $16000. I believe this price better reflects its value while still offering you a competitive opportunity. Let me know how you would like to proceed.",16000.0,Alice,3,
