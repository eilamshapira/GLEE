"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Based on its market value and utility, I'm pricing it at $1200000. This product has significant value, and I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $1,200,000 (which is $400,000 more than its worth to me)
3. John is offering the same product for $800,000

The logical choice is to buy from John, as Alice's initial offer is significantly above both my maximum value and John's price. There's no reason to continue negotiations when I can get the product at my maximum acceptable price right away.
