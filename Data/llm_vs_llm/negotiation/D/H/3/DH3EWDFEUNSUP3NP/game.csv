"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I must point out that I can purchase the same product from another seller for $10000. While I'd prefer to do business with you, your price of $25000 is significantly above market value. I'd be willing to pay $8000 for the product, which I believe is fair considering the alternatives available to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your transparency about the alternative option, but I must clarify that the product I'm offering is of superior quality and condition compared to what you'd find elsewhere. Considering this, I'm willing to revisit my initial price and offer a discount. I can let the product go for $22000, which I believe is a fair price given its exceptional value.",22000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price and explaining the superior quality of your product. However, I need to be clear that this product is worth no more than $10000 to me, which happens to be exactly what John is charging. While I understand your product may have additional features or better quality, I cannot justify paying more than double what it's worth to me. I could go up to $9000 as a courtesy for the superior quality you've mentioned, but that's really my ceiling for this purchase.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your honesty about the product's value to you. However, I must consider the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product. Given the significant difference between your offer and my minimum price, I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and John's offer. I can let the product go for $12000, which I believe is a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,5,
