"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","$25,000 is significantly higher than the $10,000 maximum value this product is worth to me. It's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $10,000. Since Alice's price is more than double what I can get elsewhere, I should reject this offer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your transparency about the alternative option, but I must clarify that the product I'm offering is of superior quality and condition compared to what you'd find elsewhere. Considering this, I'm willing to revisit my initial price and offer a discount. I can let the product go for $22000, which I believe is a fair price given its exceptional value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her price, but $22,000 is still more than double what the product is worth to me (maximum $10,000) and much higher than John's price of $10,000. Even if the product is of superior quality as Alice claims, the price difference is too significant to justify.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price and explaining the superior quality of your product. However, I need to be clear that this product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, which happens to be exactly what John is charging. While I understand your product may have additional features or better quality, I cannot justify paying more than double what it's worth to me. I could go up to $9,000 as a courtesy for the superior quality you've mentioned, but that's really my ceiling for this purchase."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your honesty about the product's value to you. However, I must consider the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product. Given the significant difference between your offer and my minimum price, I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and John's offer. I can let the product go for $12000, which I believe is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, but at $12,000, her price is still 20% higher than John's price of $10,000 and exceeds what the product is worth to me. Since I can get the exact same product from John for $10,000, and that price aligns with the maximum value to me, it makes more financial sense to go with John's offer.
