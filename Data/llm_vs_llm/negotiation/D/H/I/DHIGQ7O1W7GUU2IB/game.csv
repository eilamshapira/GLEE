"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Considering its rarity and value, I'm initially offering it to you for $25000.",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $25000 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller offering the same product for $15000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $12000 for the product. This is a fair price considering market conditions and my budget constraints.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your budget, the product's value is higher. Considering the unique aspects of the product and my investment in it, I can lower the price to $22000. I am confident that this price is fair given the market value. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $22000 is still above what I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I have another seller offering the identical product for $15000. I value doing business with you, so I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. I can pay $13500, which is a fair compromise considering my alternatives. This is a genuine offer based on my budget constraints and the product's market value.",13500.0,Bob,4,
