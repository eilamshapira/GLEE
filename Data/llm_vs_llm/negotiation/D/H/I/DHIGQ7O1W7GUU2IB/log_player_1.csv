Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Considering its rarity and value, I'm initially offering it to you for $25,000."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $25000 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller offering the same product for $15000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $12000 for the product. This is a fair price considering market conditions and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $12,000, and my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, I need to reject his offer. I will proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your budget, the product's value is higher. Considering the unique aspects of the product and my investment in it, I can lower the price to $22,000. I am confident that this price is fair given the market value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $22000 is still above what I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I have another seller offering the identical product for $15000. I value doing business with you, so I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. I can pay $13500, which is a fair compromise considering my alternatives. This is a genuine offer based on my budget constraints and the product's market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is still below my minimum of $15,000. I could try to negotiate further, but I am starting to feel that Bob might not be willing to pay a price I can accept. I can guarantee $15,000 by selling to John, and that seems like a more secure option at this point.
