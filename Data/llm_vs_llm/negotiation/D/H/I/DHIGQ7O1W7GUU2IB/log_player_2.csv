"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Considering its rarity and value, I'm initially offering it to you for $25000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer of $25,000 exceeds the maximum value of $15,000 that the product is worth to you, and John is willing to sell the same product for exactly $15,000, it would not be financially prudent to accept Alice's current offer. The best option is to either make a counteroffer to Alice or buy from John immediately.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice that is reasonable but still gives me some room to negotiate.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $25,000 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller offering the same product for $15,000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering market conditions and my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your budget, the product's value is higher. Considering the unique aspects of the product and my investment in it, I can lower the price to $22000. I am confident that this price is fair given the market value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price from $25,000 to $22,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still above the $15,000 that the product is worth to me, and John is offering it for exactly $15,000. Since Alice's current offer exceeds the maximum value I'm willing to pay, I should not accept it.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $22,000 is still above what I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I have another seller offering the identical product for $15,000. I value doing business with you, so I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. I can pay $13,500, which is a fair compromise considering my alternatives. This is a genuine offer based on my budget constraints and the product's market value."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
