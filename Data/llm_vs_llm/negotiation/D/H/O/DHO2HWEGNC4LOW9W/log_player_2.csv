"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this exclusive product. After careful consideration of its value, I'm willing to sell it to you at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision that maximizes my value.

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $2,000,000, which exceeds my valuation by a significant amount. Meanwhile, John is willing to sell me the same product for $800,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is much higher than both my valuation and John's price, I should buy from John.
