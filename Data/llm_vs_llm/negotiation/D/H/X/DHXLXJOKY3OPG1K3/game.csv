"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the premium product. I'm interested in the product, but the price of $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6000, considering the market value and my budget. Looking forward to your response.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your counteroffer. However, $6000 is significantly below the product's value. The quality and features of this product justify a higher price point. I understand budget constraints, so I'm willing to reduce my initial offer to $15000. This represents a substantial discount from my original price while still reflecting the true value of the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and reduce the price to $15000. However, it's still above my budget. I'm looking for a more reasonable price. Considering my previous offer and your counteroffer, I'd like to propose a compromise at $7500. This price reflects a serious commitment to purchasing the product while being mindful of my financial constraints. I hope we can meet at this price.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your continued interest and for increasing your offer to $7500. I do appreciate your effort to meet me partway, but I must point out that the product has a minimum value of $10000 to me, which is what I could sell it for to another interested party. Given our negotiation so far, I'm willing to offer you the product at $12500, which is a significant reduction from my previous offers. This price represents excellent value considering the product's quality and market worth.",12500.0,Alice,5,
