Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your counteroffer. However, $6000 is significantly below the product's value. The quality and features of this product justify a higher price point. I understand budget constraints, so I'm willing to reduce my initial offer to $15000. This represents a substantial discount from my original price while still reflecting the true value of the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your continued interest and for increasing your offer to $7500. I do appreciate your effort to meet me partway, but I must point out that the product has a minimum value of $10000 to me, which is what I could sell it for to another interested party. Given our negotiation so far, I'm willing to offer you the product at $12500, which is a significant reduction from my previous offers. This price represents excellent value considering the product's quality and market worth.
