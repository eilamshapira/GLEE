"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","$100 is a reasonable offer as it's well above my minimum threshold of $80. While I could try to negotiate for a bit more, there's always the risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Since this is a solid offer that gives me a good profit, I'll accept it.
