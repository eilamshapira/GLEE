Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{
  ""product_price"": 950000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Considering my options and the goal of maximizing profit, I'll go with option 2:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

```json
{
  ""product_price"": 930000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","This is getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I need to weigh the risk of getting a higher offer against the certainty of selling to John for $800,000. Given that Bob's offer is still above my minimum, I'll try one more counteroffer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","This is a tough decision. Bob's offer is only $50,000 above what I know I can get from John. The risk of further negotiation is that Bob will offer less, or that the negotiation will fail completely, and I'll be forced to sell to John anyway. I think it's time to secure the sale, even if it isn't the absolute highest price.
