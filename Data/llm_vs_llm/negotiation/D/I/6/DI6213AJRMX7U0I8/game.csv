"Hi Alice, I appreciate your interest in making this deal happen. I'm prepared to make you an offer of $1000000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you or if you would like to discuss further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $1000000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm countering with an offer of $2200000. Let me know if this works for you.",2200000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to lower my previous offer to $2000000. This is still a significant investment, but I'm confident it will be worth it for you. Please let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your revised offer. I understand your position, but I still believe the product should come at a more economical price. How about we settle at $1150000? This is my best offer given the market alternatives I have on hand. Looking forward to your thoughts.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your position, $1150000 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $1800000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product. Please let me know if this works for you.",1800000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're still apart on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway by lowering my offer to $1700000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
