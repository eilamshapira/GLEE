"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'll be very interested in. Based on its rarity and significance, I'm willing to offer it to you for a price of: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Based on the information provided, I can see that Alice is offering the product for $25,000, which exceeds the $10,000 maximum value that the product is worth to me. Additionally, John is offering the same product for $10,000, which is exactly at my maximum valuation.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and John's offer is significantly better ($15,000 less than Alice's offer), the rational choice would be to buy from John.
