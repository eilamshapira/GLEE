"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I've got a great product I think you'll be really interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for a special price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer of $100 is less than my maximum budget of $120, it's a good deal for me. I don't want to risk losing this opportunity and having to pay more to John.
