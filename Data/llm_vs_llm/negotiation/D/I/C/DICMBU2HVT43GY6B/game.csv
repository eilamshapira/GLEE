"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is quite high for this product. Given that I can get the same product from John at that price, I'd like to work out a better deal with you. I'm willing to offer $9500, which would still give you a good profit margin while providing me with a better value.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from. I can lower the price a bit for you. How about we settle at $10500? I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value it offers.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for lowering the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10500 is better, I think we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. I can offer $10000, which gives you a solid profit while giving me a reasonable discount compared to John's price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
