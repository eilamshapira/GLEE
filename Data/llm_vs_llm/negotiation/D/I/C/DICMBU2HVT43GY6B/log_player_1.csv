Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is quite high for this product. Given that I can get the same product from John at that price, I'd like to work out a better deal with you. I'm willing to offer $9500, which would still give you a good profit margin while providing me with a better value.
