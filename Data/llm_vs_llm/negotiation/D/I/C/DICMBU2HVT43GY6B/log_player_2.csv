"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand the value this product can bring to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000, which I believe is a fair price given its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth up to $12,000 to me (my maximum value)
2. The product is worth $8,000 to Alice (her cost)
3. Alice is offering the product at $12,000
4. John's price is also $12,000

Alice's offer is at my maximum willingness to pay, and it's equal to John's price. Since Alice's cost is $8,000, there should be room for negotiation to get a better price. It would be better to reject this offer and make a counteroffer that's lower than $12,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's above Alice's cost but significantly below her initial offer, leaving room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is quite high for this product. Given that I can get the same product from John at that price, I'd like to work out a better deal with you. I'm willing to offer $9,500, which would still give you a good profit margin while providing me with a better value."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from. I can lower the price a bit for you. How about we settle at $10500? I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this updated situation:

1. Alice has come down from $12,000 to $10,500
2. This is a $1,500 reduction from her initial offer
3. It's still $2,500 above her cost of $8,000
4. It's $1,500 less than John's price

This is a significant improvement from the initial offer and shows Alice is willing to negotiate. However, there might still be room for a better price. Given that we started at $9,500 and Alice came down to $10,500, we might be able to meet somewhere in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll propose a price that moves closer to Alice's last offer while still trying to get a better deal.

{""message"": ""Thank you for lowering the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,500 is better, I think we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. I can offer $10,000, which gives you a solid profit while giving me a reasonable discount compared to John's price."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
