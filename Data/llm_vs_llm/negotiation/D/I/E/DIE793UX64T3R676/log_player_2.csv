"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The rational choice here is to buy from John for $15,000 because:
1. Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than what the product is worth to me ($15,000)
2. Even if I make a counteroffer, Alice is unlikely to go below $15,000 since that's what the product is worth to her
3. John's price ($15,000) matches my maximum valuation, and while it doesn't save me money, it's better than paying $20,000 to Alice"
