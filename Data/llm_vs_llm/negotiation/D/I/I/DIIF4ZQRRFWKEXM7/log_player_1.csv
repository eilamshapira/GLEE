"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product is valuable, I'm aiming to get the best possible price. How about $1200000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Considering the value I place on the product ($1,000,000) and Bob's valuation ($1,500,000), $1,200,000 is a reasonable price. I'd rather sell to Bob and make more money than to John.
