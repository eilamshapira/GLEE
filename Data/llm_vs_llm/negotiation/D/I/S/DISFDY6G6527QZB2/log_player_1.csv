"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $90 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($80), but lower than my initial offer ($110), I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be $100.

So, the decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 100}"
