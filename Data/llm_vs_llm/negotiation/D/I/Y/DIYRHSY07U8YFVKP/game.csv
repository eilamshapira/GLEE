"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 might be too high for you. However, I believe the value of the product is worth more than $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and lower my price to $120. This is a great deal. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $120 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my offer of $100.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.",100.0,Bob,4,
