Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider this situation carefully. 

I'm selling a product that's worth at least $120 to me, and I know Bob values it at $100. If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell to John for $120, which is already my minimum acceptable value.

Since Bob only values the product at $100, he won't accept any offer above that amount. If I offer a price above $100, Bob will reject it, and I'll sell to John for $120, which is fine for me.

If I offer exactly $100, Bob might accept, but I'd be selling below my minimum value of $120, which would be a loss for me.

Therefore, my best strategy is to make an offer that I know Bob will reject, so I can sell to John for $120.
