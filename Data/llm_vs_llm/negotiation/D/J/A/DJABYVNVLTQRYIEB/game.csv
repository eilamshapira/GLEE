"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product sounds great, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. How about we settle at $175? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks, Alice. While I appreciate the compromise, $175 is still above my budget. How about $120? That's my final offer.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer of $120. I'm trying to be flexible here. I can offer you $140, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going. If you're interested, let me know.",140.0,Alice,5,
