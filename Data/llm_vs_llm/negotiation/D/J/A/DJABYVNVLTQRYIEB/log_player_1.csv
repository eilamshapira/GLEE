"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $200, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product sounds great, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $100 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob or sell it to John for $150 if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. How about we settle at $175? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 175}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks, Alice. While I appreciate the compromise, $175 is still above my budget. How about $120? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Since Bob said $120 is his final offer, I'll try to meet him closer to his budget while still getting a better price than selling to John. I'll offer $140, which is higher than John's offer but lower than my previous offer, to see if Bob is willing to budge a bit more. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer of $120. I'm trying to be flexible here. I can offer you $140, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going. If you're interested, let me know."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
