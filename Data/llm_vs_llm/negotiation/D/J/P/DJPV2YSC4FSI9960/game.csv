"Hello Bob, I have a quality product that I believe would be of value to you. I'm offering it to you for $200. This is a fair price considering the quality and benefits of the product. Would you like to purchase it at this price?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your product, but $200 is too high for me. I can offer you $100. Would you be willing to sell it for this price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand $200 might seem high to you, I cannot accept $100 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I can offer you the product for $180. This is still a good value considering the quality and benefits you'll receive. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $180 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I can increase my offer to $110. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but $110 is still below what I can accept for this product. I need to be transparent with you - I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $120 for this item. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $160 which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. Does this work for you?",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the discount and for being transparent with me. I appreciate it. However, $160 is still a bit high for me. I am willing to offer $125 for the product. Would you consider this price?",125.0,Bob,6,
