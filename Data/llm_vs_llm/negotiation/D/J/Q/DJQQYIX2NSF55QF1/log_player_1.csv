Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, and it's a fair starting point considering the product is worth at least $80 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 
 
I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $90. This is a compromise, and it's still above my minimum price of $80. I hope Bob will find it reasonable and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not the ideal price, it's better than selling to John for $80. It's also a fair compromise considering the back-and-forth negotiation."
