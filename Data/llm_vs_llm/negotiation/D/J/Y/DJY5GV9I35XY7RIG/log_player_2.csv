"Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Looking at the options:

1. Alice's offer: $119
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John for $120

Since the product is worth up to $120 to me, and Alice's offer ($119) is $1 less than John's price ($120), accepting Alice's offer would save me money compared to buying from John.
