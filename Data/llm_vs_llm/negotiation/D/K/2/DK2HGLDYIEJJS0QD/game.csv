"Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. Considering the market and my budget, I'd like to propose a price of $900000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I need to be transparent that $900000 is significantly below what this product is worth. My absolute minimum is $1500000, which is the current market value. I actually have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at this price. However, I'd like to give you the opportunity to match this offer if you're interested in the product.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your transparency about the market value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1500000. Considering you mentioned another buyer, John, is willing to buy it for the same price I can get it from him, I'd like to propose a price of $950000. If we can meet in the middle, I'm willing to make a deal today.",950000.0,Bob,4,
