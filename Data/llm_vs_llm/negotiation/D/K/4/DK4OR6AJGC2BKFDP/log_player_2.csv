"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product, and I believe it will be a valuable addition to your collection. Considering its rarity and quality, I'm willing to let it go for $1199999. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,199,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,199,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Looking at this situation:

1. The product is worth at most $1,000,000 to me
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $1,199,999
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $1,000,000

If I accept Alice's offer, I would be paying $199,999 more than the product is worth to me, which doesn't make financial sense.

If I buy from John, I'd pay $1,000,000, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me.

The logical choice is to buy from John and save $199,999.
