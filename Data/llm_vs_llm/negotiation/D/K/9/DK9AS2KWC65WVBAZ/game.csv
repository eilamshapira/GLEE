"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $200 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $60 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be out of your budget, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. How about we meet in the middle at $180? I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair offer.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $180 is still too high for me. I can go up to $70, which is a bit higher than my initial offer but still within my budget. Let me know if this works for you.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid to $70. However, I still have a significant gap between your offer and my desired price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for the product. How about we try $150? It's a more reasonable price, considering the product's worth.",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your latest offer. I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but $150 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $75, which is the highest I can go while still keeping it within my financial limits. Let me know if this works for you.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $75. I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make a significant concession. I'll offer the product to you for $120, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. If you're unable to meet this price, I'll have to explore other options.",120.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price to $120, but it's still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $80, which is my absolute maximum. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider buying from another seller. Let me know your thoughts.",80.0,Bob,8,
