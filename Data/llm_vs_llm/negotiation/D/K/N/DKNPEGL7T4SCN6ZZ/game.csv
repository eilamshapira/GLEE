,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $10000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18000 might be out of your budget, but $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and lower the price. Let's meet in the middle.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17000 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. How about we settle at $11000? I think this is a fair price considering my budget constraints.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to lower the price again, but not as low as $11000. How about we meet at $16000?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $16000, but it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11500. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. What do you say?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make a small concession, but not as low as $11500. I'll meet you in the middle of my previous offer and the alternative I have, which is $15500. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, $15500 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $11800. This is my final offer within my budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",11800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer of $11800, but unfortunately, it's still not meeting my minimum requirements. I've thought about it, and I'm willing to make a last concession. I'll sell the product to you for $15000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll have to consider other options.",15000.0,Alice,9,
