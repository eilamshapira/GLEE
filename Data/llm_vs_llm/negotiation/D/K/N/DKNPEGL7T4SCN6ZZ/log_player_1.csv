Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $16000, but it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11500. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. What do you say?

I reject Bob's offer of $11,500 because it's still lower than the product's value to me and also lower than the alternative offer from John. I'd like to make another counteroffer to try to reach a mutually beneficial price. My next offer will be $15,500, which is closer to the alternative offer, but still gives Bob a chance to get the product."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, $15500 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $11800. This is my final offer within my budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.

I reject Bob's offer of $11,800 because it's still lower than the product's value to me and also lower than the alternative offer from John. Since Bob mentioned this is his final offer within his budget constraints, I don't see much room for further negotiation that would meet my minimum price requirement. However, I'll make one last attempt to reach a mutually beneficial price before considering the alternative offer from John. My next offer will be $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept."

I've thought about it, and I'm willing to make a last concession. I'll sell the product to you for $15,000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
