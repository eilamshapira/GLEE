"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for $1150000. I believe it will be a great addition to your portfolio and I'm confident you'll find immense value in it. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is below this threshold, it's a good deal. Additionally, buying from Alice is cheaper than buying from John. Therefore, I will accept Alice's offer.
