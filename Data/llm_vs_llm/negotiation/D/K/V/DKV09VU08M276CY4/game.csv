"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out with this opportunity. While I am interested in the product, $1150000 is a bit high for my budget. I've done some market research, and considering the current market conditions, I would like to counter with an offer of $900000. This represents a significant profit for you while allowing me some room in my budget. I'm looking forward to doing business with you.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm confident in the quality and exclusivity of the product, and I believe it's worth more than $900000. With that in mind, I'm prepared to lower my price to $1000000. Let me know if we can move forward at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thanks for lowering your price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your product definitely has value, but I'm working within certain budget constraints. I can go up to $950000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer and would give you a substantial profit margin. This price would allow me to move forward with the purchase immediately. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,
