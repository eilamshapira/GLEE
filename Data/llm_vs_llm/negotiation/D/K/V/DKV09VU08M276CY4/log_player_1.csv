Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out with this opportunity. While I am interested in the product, $1150000 is a bit high for my budget. I've done some market research, and considering the current market conditions, I would like to counter with an offer of $900000. This represents a significant profit for you while allowing me some room in my budget. I'm looking forward to doing business with you.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for lowering your price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your product definitely has value, but I'm working within certain budget constraints.
