"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, I'm ready to make my first offer to Bob. Here's the initial offer:

```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $1,200,000, and knowing my minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000, I have to carefully consider my options. I have 8 rounds left to negotiate. I want to make the most profit.

I could:

*   **Accept the offer:** This guarantees a sale at my minimum, but I lose potential for a higher price.
*   **Reject and Counter:** This risks losing the deal altogether, but gives me a chance to get a higher price, especially since it's still early in the negotiation.
*   **Sell to John:** This guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price.

Considering I have 8 rounds remaining, I'll **reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer**.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a good offer from Bob! $1,400,000 is significantly above my minimum acceptable price. I have 6 rounds left.

I have the following options:

*   **Accept the offer:** Secure a profit of $200,000.
*   **Reject and Counter:** Risk losing the deal, but potentially increase the profit.
*   **Sell to John:** Guarantee a sale at my minimum acceptable price.

Given the profit margin and the remaining rounds, it makes sense to accept the offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```"
