"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $225. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $225
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given the information provided, Alice's offer of $225 is significantly higher than what the product is worth to me ($100) and also higher than John's offering price of $100.

Since I can buy the product from John for $100, which is exactly what the product is worth to me, there's no reason to accept Alice's much higher offer. I could try to negotiate with Alice, but even if we reached a compromise, it likely wouldn't be better than $100.

Therefore, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
