"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable for your business. I understand you may not know the full potential of this product, so I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its potential. I'm asking for $1500000. This is a substantial discount from the true value I believe it holds, and I am confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. Please let me know your decision.  If you decline, I will be selling it to John for $1000000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
