"Alice's offer: The product price will be $799,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $799,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $799,999 is less than my maximum budget of $800,000, and it's only $1 less than what I'm willing to pay, it's a good deal for me.
