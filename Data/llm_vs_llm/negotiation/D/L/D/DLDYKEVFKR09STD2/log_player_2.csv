# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product. It's a great deal! I'm offering it to you for $175. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer is much higher than your maximum price and what John is offering.  It makes the most sense to buy from John for $80."
