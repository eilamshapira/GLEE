"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is higher than the minimum value of $10,000 that I have for the product, and I don't know if I can get a better offer from him, I will reject his offer and try to negotiate further.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $12,000. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000, considering the product's unique features and value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $13000. This is the best I can do within my budget. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's new offer of $13,000 is still below my desired price, but getting closer, and he mentioned it's the best he can do within his budget, I'll consider accepting it. However, I'll think about the fact that I can sell it to John for $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. Given that Bob's offer is $3,000 higher than John's, I'll accept Bob's offer to maximize my earnings.
