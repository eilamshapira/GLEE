"Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you at a price of $14000. I believe this is a fair price given its worth and the benefits you'll receive.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $14000 is quite close to what I could pay elsewhere. The market value for this product is closer to $10000, and I'd be willing to pay $9500 for it. This gives you a good profit margin while providing me with some savings compared to other options. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but given the product's uniqueness and the value it provides, I'd be willing to go as low as $12000. I believe this is a mutually beneficial price.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've researched similar products and know that $12000 is still on the higher end. I can increase my offer to $10500, which would give you a substantial profit while still being reasonable for me. This represents a fair middle ground between our positions. What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,4,
