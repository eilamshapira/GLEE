Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $14000 is quite close to what I could pay elsewhere. The market value for this product is closer to $10000, and I'd be willing to pay $9500 for it. This gives you a good profit margin while providing me with some savings compared to other options. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've researched similar products and know that $12000 is still on the higher end. I can increase my offer to $10500, which would give you a substantial profit while still being reasonable for me. This represents a fair middle ground between our positions. What do you say?
