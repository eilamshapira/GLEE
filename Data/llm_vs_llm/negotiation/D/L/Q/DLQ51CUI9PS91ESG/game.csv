"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $75 as it's significantly below the product's value. Given the quality and market value of the product, I can offer it to you for $200. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair offer for what you're getting.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $200 is still beyond what I'm willing to spend. I can go up to $90. Let me know if that works for you.",90.0,Bob,4,
