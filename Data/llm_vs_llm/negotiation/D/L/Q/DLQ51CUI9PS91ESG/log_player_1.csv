Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it for $250. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let me explain my reasoning: Bob's offer of $75 is significantly below my minimum value of $150. Since I have John willing to buy at $150, accepting an offer below this price would be a loss. I'll reject and make a new counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a price point that could work for both of us, but if we can't reach an agreement, I always have the $150 option with John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $75 as it's significantly below the product's value. Given the quality and market value of the product, I can offer it to you for $200. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair offer for what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $200 is still beyond what I'm willing to spend. I can go up to $90. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Let me explain my reasoning: Bob's second offer of $90 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and his small increase from $75 to $90 suggests he's not likely to reach a price point that would be profitable for me. Since he's still so far from my minimum acceptable price, and has only increased his offer by a small amount, it's best to take the guaranteed $150 from John rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to reach an acceptable price point."
