"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","In this situation, both Alice and John are offering the product for $12,000, which is exactly at my maximum valuation. Since both offers are identical, there's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other. However, since Alice made the offer first and we're already in negotiation with her, it makes sense to accept her offer rather than reject it or switch to John.
