Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","I have to make a decision. Considering my options:

*   **Sell to John:** Guarantees me $100.
*   **Accept Bob's offer:** Only gives me $90.
*   **Reject and Counteroffer:** Could potentially get me more than $100 (though I'm at risk of getting less).

Since the product is worth at least $100 to me, and I believe I can get more than that, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","I need to decide what to do.

*   **Sell to John:** Guarantees $100.
*   **Accept Bob's offer:** Only gives me $95.
*   **Reject and Counteroffer:** Still a chance for more, but risky.

Given the previous offers, it seems unlikely Bob will go higher. I'm also getting close to John's offer.
