"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11800 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending at this time. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will reject Bob's offer of $11,000 and make a counteroffer. Since Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product, I believe I can negotiate a better price.

My counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $11,000. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,600. This is still a competitive price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 11600}"
