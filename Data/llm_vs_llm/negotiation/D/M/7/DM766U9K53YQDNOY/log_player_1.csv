```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, considering Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below my minimum of $150, I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""product_price"": 180}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","This is getting frustrating. $115 is still below my minimum. However, I'm starting to think Bob might not be willing to go much higher, and I don't want to lose out on the sale entirely. Given I can sell to John for $150, I'll cut my losses here.
