"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but I cannot accept $800000 as it's below the product's minimum value. However, I'm willing to work with you. Given that I have another interested buyer at $1000000, I can offer you the product for $1200000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
