Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its market value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I find the price a bit high. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Given that I know I can get $1,000,000 from John, and the product is worth at least that much to me, I cannot accept Bob's offer of $800,000 as it would result in a loss. I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer, giving Bob another chance to reach a more favorable agreement before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but I cannot accept $800,000 as it's below the product's minimum value. However, I'm willing to work with you. Given that I have another interested buyer at $1,000,000, I can offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I still find the price too high. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000, and Bob seems unlikely to raise his offer above $1,000,000 given his negotiation pattern, the most profitable decision is to sell to John. This ensures I receive the minimum acceptable value for the product without risking further negotiation time that might not lead to a better outcome."
