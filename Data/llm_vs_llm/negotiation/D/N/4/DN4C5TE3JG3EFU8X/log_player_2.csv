"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer. She's offering the product for $20,000, but the product is only worth $8,000 to me at most. Additionally, I already have the option to buy from John for $8,000. Alice's offer is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice that reflects the product's value to me but gives room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": $5,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price from $20,000 to $18,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $18,000 is still significantly higher than both the product's maximum value to me ($8,000) and John's offer ($8,000). There's no reason to accept this offer when I can get the same product for less elsewhere.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'll still stay well below my maximum value since I have John's offer as a backup.

{""product_price"": $6,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price again to $16,000, which indicates she's willing to continue negotiating. However, this price is still double what I can pay John ($8,000), and it exceeds the maximum value of the product to me. There's no reason to accept this offer when I have a better alternative.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly again to show continued good faith in the negotiation, but I'm still maintaining a significant buffer below John's price.

{""product_price"": $6,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice is continuing to lower her price, now at $15,000, but it's still almost double John's price of $8,000. Since we're now in round 7 of 10, and Alice's offers remain far above my alternative option, it makes sense to consider my backup plan more seriously.
