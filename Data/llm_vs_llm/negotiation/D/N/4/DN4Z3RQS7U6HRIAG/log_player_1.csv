"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Let me start with a high initial offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get a good price.

{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even below what the product is worth to him ($12,000), I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's previous offer was quite low, I'll lower my initial price but still keep it above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 16500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's new offer of $11,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Given that I have a guaranteed offer from John at $15,000, and Bob's offers are still far from my minimum price, I'll choose to sell to John rather than continue this negotiation which doesn't seem to be approaching my target price.
