"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. Since Bob's offer of $95 is below my minimum acceptable value of $120, and I have a guaranteed offer from John at $120, it doesn't make sense to accept Bob's offer.
