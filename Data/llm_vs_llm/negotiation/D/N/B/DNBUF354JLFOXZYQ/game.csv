"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $600000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest. However, I can't go as low as $600000. The best I can offer is $900000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $750000. This is as high as I'm comfortable going, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
