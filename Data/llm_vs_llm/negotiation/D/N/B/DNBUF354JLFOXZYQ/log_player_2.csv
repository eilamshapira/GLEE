"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have an exceptional product that I believe could be of great value to you. I am willing to sell it to you for $1000000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since the offered price of $1,000,000 is above my maximum budget of $800,000, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. This will give us room to negotiate and potentially find a mutually acceptable price.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $600,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 600000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest. However, I can't go as low as $600000. The best I can offer is $900000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's new offer of $900,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000, I'll reject it and try to negotiate further. I'm hoping to find a price that works for both of us.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one, but still below Alice's latest offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and meet her halfway.

{""message"": ""Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. This is as high as I'm comfortable going, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
