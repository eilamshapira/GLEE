"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $10000 is too high for me. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $8000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $7000? This would be a win-win situation for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly above $7000. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $8500?  This price reflects the quality and value you're getting.",8500.0,Alice,3,
