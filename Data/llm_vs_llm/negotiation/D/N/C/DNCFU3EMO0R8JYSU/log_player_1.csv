Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $10000 is too high for me. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $8000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $7000? This would be a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
