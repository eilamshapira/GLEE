"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I believe a price of $10000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $10,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative price ($8,000). There's no reason to accept this offer when I can either negotiate for a better price or buy from John at $8,000. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $10,000 is too high for me. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $8,000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $7,000? This would be a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly above $7000. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $8500?  This price reflects the quality and value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer of $8,500 is still above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000), it makes the most economic sense to buy from John. Alice seems unlikely to go below $8,000 given her response that the product value is ""truly above $7,000"" and her counteroffer is only dropping by small increments. Rather than continue negotiating, I'll take the guaranteed $8,000 price from John."
