"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get well above my minimum value of $15,000.

{""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","I'll reject Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Since John is willing to pay $15,000, I would never accept anything lower than that amount.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a new counteroffer in the next round, lowering my initial price somewhat but still maintaining a good margin above $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial $25,000, but still keep it well above my minimum to leave room for negotiation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $13,500 since it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Bob's second offer shows some movement upward from $12,000 to $13,500, but it's still not enough. Since I can always sell to John for $15,000, there's no reason to accept anything lower.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob has shown willingness to increase his price significantly (from $12,000 to $13,500), I'll reduce my price further but still maintain it well above my minimum of $15,000.

{""product_price"": 18500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob is now offering $15,000, which is exactly the same as John's guaranteed offer. Since we've gone through several rounds of negotiation and Bob hasn't shown willingness to go higher than $15,000, and we're already in round 6 out of 10, I'll choose to accept Bob's offer. There's no advantage to continuing negotiation or selling to John at this point since the price is the same.
