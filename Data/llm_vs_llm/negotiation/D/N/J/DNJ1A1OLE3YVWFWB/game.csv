"Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I'm offering for sale. Given its quality and market value, I'm listing it at $15000. I believe this is a fair price for what you're getting, but I'm open to discussion if you have a different perspective.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. $15000 is well above my budget. I can only go as high as $4000 for this premium product. Let me know if this works for you.",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $4000 is significantly below what I can accept for this product. Its value to me is at least $8000, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Could you consider a price of $12000? This is already a substantial reduction from my initial offer.",12000.0,Alice,3,
