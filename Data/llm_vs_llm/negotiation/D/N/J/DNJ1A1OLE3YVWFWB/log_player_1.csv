Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I'm offering for sale. Given its quality and market value, I'm listing it at $15,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. $15000 is well above my budget. I can only go as high as $4000 for this premium product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $4,000 is significantly below what I can accept for this product. Its value to me is at least $8,000, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Could you consider a price of $12,000? This is already a substantial reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
