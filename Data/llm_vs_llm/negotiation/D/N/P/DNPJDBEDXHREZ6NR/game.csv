"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I believe it's a fair price considering I can also buy it from John for $120.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. Considering your interest in the product and the price you mentioned you'd pay to John, I'd like to propose a price that's closer to my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle!",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet in the middle. However, $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer, but not that much. How about we split the difference between my initial offer and your new offer? I'd be willing to pay $110 for the product.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise and meet in the middle. Splitting the difference between your initial offer and my previous offer is a reasonable approach. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Considering your new offer of $110, I'd like to propose a price of $125, which is closer to the middle ground between our last two offers. Let me know if this works for you!",125.0,Alice,5,
