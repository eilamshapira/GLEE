Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I believe it's a fair price considering I can also buy it from John for $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price. Since Bob mentioned he's willing to pay $120 for the product from John, I'll try to meet him halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. 

My counteroffer: $140"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet in the middle. However, $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer, but not that much. How about we split the difference between my initial offer and your new offer? I'd be willing to pay $110 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since he's willing to pay $110, which is higher than his initial offer, I'll try to meet him closer to the middle of my last offer ($140) and his new offer ($110). 

My counteroffer: $125"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise and meet in the middle. Splitting the difference between your initial offer and my previous offer is a reasonable approach. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.
