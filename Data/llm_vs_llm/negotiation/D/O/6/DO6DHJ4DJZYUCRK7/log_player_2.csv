"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll analyze the situation:

- Alice is offering the product for $150
- The product is worth no more than $150 to me
- I can buy from John for $150 at any time
- This is just the first round, so I have room to negotiate with Alice

Since Alice's offer is the same as John's price, there's no advantage to accepting it right now. I should try to negotiate with Alice for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice. Since this is the beginning of the negotiation, I'll start with a reasonably low offer to leave room for potential movement in future rounds.

{""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I see that Alice has reduced her price from $150 to $130, which is a good sign. She's willing to negotiate and has already offered a better price than John's $150. Since we still have several rounds left in the negotiation, I'll continue by rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer to see if I can get an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has come down from $150 to $130, which is a $20 reduction. I came up from $90 initially, so I should move up as well to show good faith in the negotiation. I'll split the difference between my last offer ($90) and her current offer ($130).
