"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, let's analyze. Bob offered $75, and I know John will pay $80. I have to choose between:

*   **Accepting Bob's offer:** Profit of $75.
*   **Rejecting and continuing negotiations:** Could potentially get a higher price from Bob, but risk getting less or even nothing. I also risk wasting time.
*   **Selling to John:** Guaranteed profit of $80.

Given that John offers $80, and I know the product is worth at least $80 to me, the best decision is to:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```"
