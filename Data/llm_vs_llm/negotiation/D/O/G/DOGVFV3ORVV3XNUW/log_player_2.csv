"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to evaluate this offer based on my constraints. The product is worth no more than $80 to me, and I have a guaranteed option to buy it from John for $80.

Alice's offer is $150, which exceeds the value of the product to me ($80) and is higher than John's alternative offer ($80).

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer since it's significantly more expensive than both my valuation and the alternative.
