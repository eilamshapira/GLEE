"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $180 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $60 for the product. Let me know what you think.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $60 is significantly lower than I'm willing to sell for. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you a better price, but it's still above your initial offer.",150.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, $75 is still below my target price. I'm willing to make another concession to try to find a mutually agreeable price.",130.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $130 is still too high for me. I can go up to $80, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Let me know if this works for you.",80.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is your maximum offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. Considering we're close to the end of our negotiation, I'm willing to make one more compromise. This is likely as low as I'm willing to go.",125.0,Alice,9,
