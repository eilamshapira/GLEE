Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my offer to Bob. I know my product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I can definitely sell it to John for that amount. Bob values it at $1,000,000, which is less than my minimum acceptable value.

Since Bob values the product less than my reservation price, there's no zone of possible agreement between us. Any price I offer Bob would either be rejected (if above $1,000,000) or would be less than what I can get from John (if at or below $1,000,000).

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in my product. After careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. This is a fair price based on the product's market value and its worth to me. I understand you may need time to consider this offer, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have about the product's features and benefits."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
