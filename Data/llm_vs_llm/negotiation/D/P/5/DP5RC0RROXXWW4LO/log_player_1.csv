Round 2
Bob's offer:

Since I have more rounds to negotiate and Bob is showing willingness to increase his offer, I'll reject his current offer and try to get an even better price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price.

Considering that Bob's offer is only $1,000 less than what I can get from John, and I've already invested time and effort into negotiating with Bob, I think it's reasonable to accept his offer.
