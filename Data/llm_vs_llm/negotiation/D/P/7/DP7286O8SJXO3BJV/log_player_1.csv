"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $800,000 is lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,500,000) and also lower than what I initially aimed for, I will reject his offer to see if we can negotiate a better price.

My counteroffer will be $1,800,000, trying to meet somewhere in the middle but still aiming high.

However, according to the format, my response for this round should reflect my decision to reject Bob's offer and proceed with a counteroffer, which I will do in the next step.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Since there's a potential to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is my minimum value, and Bob's offer is significantly lower, I will reject Bob's offer again.

However, instead of making another counteroffer, I will consider selling the product to John, as Bob's offers have not been close enough to my target, and the negotiation does not seem to be moving in a favorable direction.
