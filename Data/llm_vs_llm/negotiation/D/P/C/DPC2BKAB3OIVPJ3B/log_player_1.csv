Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my strategy carefully. Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, that's the maximum he would be willing to pay. I already have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $120, so I don't risk anything by making an offer to Bob at or above that amount.

Given that Bob can only accept or reject my offer, and I have a guaranteed alternative, I should offer Bob exactly the product's value to him.
