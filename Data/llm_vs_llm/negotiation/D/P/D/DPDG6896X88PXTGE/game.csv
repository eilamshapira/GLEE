"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is above what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can get the same product from another seller for $12000, so I would need a better price from you to make this work. I'm willing to offer $9500 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to the other seller.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I need to maintain a certain value for this product. I can go down to $14000, which is a significant discount from my original offer but still reflects the product's worth. Let me know if this works for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. However, $14000 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I have another seller offering the same product for $12000. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer $10000. This would save me from having to go with the other seller and would give you a sale today.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to keep the price at a level that reflects the product's value. I can come down to $13000, which is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price, Alice. $13000 is getting closer, but I still need to be practical about this purchase. As I mentioned, I have a firm offer of $12000 from another seller. To close this deal with you today, I'm willing to offer $11000. This gives you $1000 more than I would need to spend elsewhere, which I think is fair for concluding our negotiation now.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your situation, but I need to maintain a minimum value for this product. I can offer it to you for $12500, which is a fair compromise considering my costs and the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",12500.0,Alice,7,
