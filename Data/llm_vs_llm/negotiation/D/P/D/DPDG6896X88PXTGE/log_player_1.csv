Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is above what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can get the same product from another seller for $12000, so I would need a better price from you to make this work. I'm willing to offer $9500 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to the other seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. However, $14000 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I have another seller offering the same product for $12000. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer $10000. This would save me from having to go with the other seller and would give you a sale today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price, Alice. $13000 is getting closer, but I still need to be practical about this purchase. As I mentioned, I have a firm offer of $12000 from another seller. To close this deal with you today, I'm willing to offer $11000. This gives you $1000 more than I would need to spend elsewhere, which I think is fair for concluding our negotiation now.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
