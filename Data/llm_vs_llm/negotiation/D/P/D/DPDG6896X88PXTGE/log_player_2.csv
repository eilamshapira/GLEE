Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is above what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can get the same product from another seller for $12,000, so I would need a better price from you to make this work. I'm willing to offer $9,500 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to the other seller."", ""product_price"": 9500}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I need to maintain a certain value for this product. I can go down to $14000, which is a significant discount from my original offer but still reflects the product's worth. Let me know if this works for you.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. However, $14,000 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I have another seller offering the same product for $12,000. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer $10,000. This would save me from having to go with the other seller and would give you a sale today."", ""product_price"": 10000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to keep the price at a level that reflects the product's value. I can come down to $13000, which is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price, Alice. $13,000 is getting closer, but I still need to be practical about this purchase. As I mentioned, I have a firm offer of $12,000 from another seller. To close this deal with you today, I'm willing to offer $11,000. This gives you $1,000 more than I would need to spend elsewhere, which I think is fair for concluding our negotiation now."", ""product_price"": 11000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your situation, but I need to maintain a minimum value for this product. I can offer it to you for $12500, which is a fair compromise considering my costs and the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.
