"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think might interest you. I'm offering it to you at a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer of $15,000 is higher than my maximum value of $10,000, and John is offering the same product for $10,000, the logical choice is to buy from John.
