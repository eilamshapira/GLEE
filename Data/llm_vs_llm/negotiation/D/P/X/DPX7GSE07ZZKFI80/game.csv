"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product! While I agree it looks great, $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $150 might be a bit high, but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I think $120 is a fair price for this product. Let me know if you're interested!",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer to my budget, but $120 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
