Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product! While I agree it looks great, $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to meet him at a price that's closer to my initial offer. My counteroffer will be $120. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $150 might be a bit high, but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I think $120 is a fair price for this product. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer to my budget, but $120 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

Since Bob's offer of $100 is the same price that John is willing to pay, and I've already negotiated with Bob for a few rounds, I think it's a good idea to accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. This way, I can ensure that the product is sold and I receive a fair price for it."
