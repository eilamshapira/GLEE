{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still shows that I'm interested in the product. Since I'm not sure what the product is worth to Alice, I'll start with a relatively low offer and see how she responds.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $500,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 500000}"

Round 3

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice reduced the price from $1,500,000 to $1,200,000, it shows that she is willing to negotiate. I'll try to meet her halfway between my previous offer of $500,000 and her current offer of $1,200,000. My next counteroffer will be $850,000.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 850000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest, Bob! While $850000 is a step in the right direction, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $1100000. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

However, I'll also keep in mind that I'm running out of rounds, so I'll need to make a more competitive offer to try to reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice is getting closer to my budget, I'll try to make a more competitive offer. I'll increase my previous offer of $850,000 to $950,000, which is still below my budget of $1,000,000, but closer to Alice's last offer of $1,100,000.

At this point, I'm not willing to go above my budget, especially since I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. I'll reject Alice's offer again, but I'll also consider the fact that I'm running out of rounds and might not be able to negotiate a better price.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice is very close to my budget, I'll try to make a final aggressive offer to see if we can reach an agreement. I'll offer $1,000,000, which is my maximum budget and also the price at which I can buy the product from John. This is my final attempt to negotiate with Alice, and if she rejects this offer, I'll likely buy the product from John.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your patience and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at my maximum budget of $1,000,000. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options. Can we do $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
