Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable value of $120, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, I'll reject Bob's low offer. However, instead of making a counteroffer, I'll take the guaranteed sale to John since there's no certainty Bob will increase his offer significantly.
