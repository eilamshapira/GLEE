"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a incredible offer for you. I'm selling a highly valuable product that I believe you'll be interested in. The price is $2000000. This is a rare opportunity to own something truly special. Are you willing to accept this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your alternative option of buying from John for $1,000,000. There's no reason to accept such a high price. By rejecting the offer, you can try to negotiate a better deal with Alice or simply proceed with purchasing from John."
