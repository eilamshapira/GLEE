"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I should evaluate my options:

*   **(1) Accept Alice's offer:** This means I pay $12,000.
*   **(2) Reject Alice's offer:** I can try to negotiate a lower price, but there is a risk that Alice will not agree.
*   **(3) Buy from John:** This means I pay $12,000.

Since I value the product at no more than $12,000, and both Alice and John are offering it for $12,000, there is no immediate financial advantage to rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price. I am indifferent between accepting Alice's offer or buying from John. Therefore, I'll accept Alice's offer.
