"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is far too high for this product. I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $800000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable price. Would you consider $600000 for the product?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, however, the value of this product is significantly higher than what John is offering. Let's meet in the middle - how about $950000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
