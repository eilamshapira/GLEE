"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its incredible potential, I'm starting the bidding at $1200000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's guaranteed price ($800,000). It would be unwise to accept this offer since I can definitely get a better deal from John. However, I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if I can get an even better price from Alice before potentially going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,200,000 is far too high for this product. I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $800,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable price. Would you consider $600,000 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, however, the value of this product is significantly higher than what John is offering. Let's meet in the middle - how about $950000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's new offer of $950,000 is still above both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's guaranteed price ($800,000), and Alice seems unlikely to go below $800,000 based on her response, it's best to take John's offer. There's no reason to pay more than $800,000 when I have a guaranteed option at that price."
