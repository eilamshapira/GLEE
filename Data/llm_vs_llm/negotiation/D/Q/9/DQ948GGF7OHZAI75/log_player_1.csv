"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This price represents excellent value considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but considering my budget and other market comparisons, I can offer you $10000 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Since Bob rejected $11,500 but is interested enough to make a counteroffer, and the product is worth $12,000 to him, there's room for negotiation above $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low considering the product's value. I understand you're working within a budget, so I can reduce my initial price. How about $11,000? This is a fair price that gives you good value while allowing me to make a reasonable return."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I understand weâ€™re close but my budget constraints are firm. I can increase my offer slightly to $10750, which I consider a fair compromise given the alternatives available to me. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $10,750. This is a reasonable compromise as it's $750 more than what John is offering ($10,000), and Bob has shown that he's unlikely to go much higher. Continuing the negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely, and Bob's offer provides a better return than the alternative with John."
