"Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $200 is quite high for my budget. I know the market value of similar products, and I would be willing to pay $80 for it. This is a fair price that would work for me.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, after considering your perspective, I'm willing to lower my price. I can offer the product to you for $160. This is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for lowering the price, Alice. However, $160 is still beyond my budget. I actually have another seller offering this product for $100, but I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $90, which would be a good deal for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I've reconsidered and I'm willing to lower my price further to meet you halfway. I can offer the product for $140. This is a competitive price that reflects the value of the product.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I have a firm budget constraint of $100, which is also the price another seller is offering. I'm still interested in buying from you, and I can offer $95, which is very close to the market price. This would allow you to make the sale now rather than potentially losing it to another seller.",95.0,Bob,6,
