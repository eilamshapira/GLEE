"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $200 is quite high for my budget. I know the market value of similar products, and I would be willing to pay $80 for it. This is a fair price that would work for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for lowering the price, Alice. However, $160 is still beyond my budget. I actually have another seller offering this product for $100, but I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $90, which would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. Let's settle for $140. This is a competitive price, and I believe it reflects the product's value fairly."", ""product_price"": 140}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I've reconsidered and I'm willing to lower my price further to meet you halfway. I can offer the product for $140. This is a competitive price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 140}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I have a firm budget constraint of $100, which is also the price another seller is offering. I'm still interested in buying from you, and I can offer $95, which is very close to the market price. This would allow you to make the sale now rather than potentially losing it to another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
