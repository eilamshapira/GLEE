"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $200. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer of $200 is higher than my maximum value ($100) and higher than John's price ($100), it wouldn't make sense to accept it. Given that John offers the product at my maximum acceptable price, I could buy from him. However, I'll first try to negotiate with Alice to potentially get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's below John's price but still reasonable enough to potentially interest Alice.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $200 is quite high for my budget. I know the market value of similar products, and I would be willing to pay $80 for it. This is a fair price that would work for me."", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after considering your perspective, I'm willing to lower my price. I can offer the product to you for $160. This is a fair compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $160 is still significantly higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). While Alice did reduce the price, it's still not competitive enough. I'll continue negotiating to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for lowering the price, Alice. However, $160 is still beyond my budget. I actually have another seller offering this product for $100, but I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $90, which would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I've reconsidered and I'm willing to lower my price further to meet you halfway. I can offer the product for $140. This is a competitive price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's offer of $140 is still above both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). While Alice continues to lower the price, at this point it's becoming clear that she might not be willing to go below $100. Given that we're already in round 5 out of 10, and there's a guaranteed option to buy from John at $100, I'll make one final attempt to negotiate with Alice before considering buying from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I have a firm budget constraint of $100, which is also the price another seller is offering. I'm still interested in buying from you, and I can offer $95, which is very close to the market price. This would allow you to make the sale now rather than potentially losing it to another seller."", ""product_price"": 95}"
