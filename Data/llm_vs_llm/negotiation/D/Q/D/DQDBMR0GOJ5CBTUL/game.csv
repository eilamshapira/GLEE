"Bob, I'm excited about the possibility of you acquiring this product. It truly is a unique asset with significant value. To start the conversation, I'm offering it to you for $1450000. I believe this price reflects its potential and the opportunity it presents for you.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the value of the product, but the price you're asking is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $900000, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions and my financial constraints.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. However, I value your interest. How about we meet in the middle a bit? I can offer it to you for $1400000. This price is very competitive and represents a significant discount from my initial asking price. It is also an acknowledgement of your financial constraints and the current market conditions.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1400000 is still too high for me. Considering the value I place on the product and my budget, I'm prepared to increase my offer to $950000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer and reflects my serious interest in acquiring the product at a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $950000. While I can't go that low, I'm willing to make another move to try and close this deal. I value your interest, but also need to ensure I am getting a good price. How about $1350000? I think that is as low as I can reasonably go.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1350000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is the maximum I can afford. This offer reflects the highest value I can place on the product while still being financially feasible for me. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
