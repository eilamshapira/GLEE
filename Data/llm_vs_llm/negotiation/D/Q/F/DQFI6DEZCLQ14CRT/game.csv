"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $25000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $8000.  I believe this is a fair price considering my current budget constraints.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but $8000 is significantly below the product's value. My initial offer might have been high, so I'm willing to reduce it, but I cannot go below $20000 for this product. The quality and value you'll receive justify this price.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $20000 is still too high for me. I can increase my offer to $10000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer and reflects my strong interest in acquiring the product.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
