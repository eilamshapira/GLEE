Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $25,000. This is a competitive price for what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $25000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $8000.  I believe this is a fair price considering my current budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. $8,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even John is willing to pay more than that. However, I'll continue negotiating with Bob to try to reach a better price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below the product's value. My initial offer might have been high, so I'm willing to reduce it, but I cannot go below $20,000 for this product. The quality and value you'll receive justify this price."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $20000 is still too high for me. I can increase my offer to $10000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer and reflects my strong interest in acquiring the product.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $15,000. Bob's latest offer of $10,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and his message suggests he's not willing to go much higher. Since John's offer of $15,000 is guaranteed and above Bob's current offer, it's the most prudent business decision to take John's offer rather than continue negotiations that may not reach my minimum price point."
