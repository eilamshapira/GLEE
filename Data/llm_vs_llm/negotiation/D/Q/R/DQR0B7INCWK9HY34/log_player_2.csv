"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Based on the information provided, here's my analysis:

1. Alice's offer: $2,000,000
2. John's offer: $1,000,000
3. Your maximum valuation: $1,000,000

Since Alice's offer ($2,000,000) exceeds both your maximum valuation ($1,000,000) and John's offer ($1,000,000), the rational choice would be to buy from John.
