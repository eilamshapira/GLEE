Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to choose a price for the product that maximizes my expected profit. I know the product is worth at least $150 to me (and I can sell it to John for exactly $150 if Bob rejects).

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I need to balance between:
1) Setting a higher price to earn more if Bob accepts
2) Not setting the price too high that Bob is likely to reject

A reasonable approach is to set a price meaningfully above my $150 floor but not so high that Bob would almost certainly reject.
