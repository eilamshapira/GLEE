"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given the information provided:

1. The product is worth no more than $80 to me (Bob)
2. John is offering the same product for $80
3. Alice is offering the product for $120

Alice's offer ($120) exceeds the product's worth to me ($80) and is significantly higher than John's offer ($80). It makes no economic sense to accept Alice's offer.
