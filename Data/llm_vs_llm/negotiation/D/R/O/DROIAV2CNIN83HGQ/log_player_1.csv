Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $90 is better than John's $80, but still quite low compared to Bob's known value of $120, I'll reject and make another counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll reduce my price a bit from my initial offer but still maintain a good margin.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","$95 is a reasonable offer that gives me a good profit margin above my minimum value of $80, and significantly better than John's $80. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Bob walking away or becoming frustrated. I'll accept this offer.
