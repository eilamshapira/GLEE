"Hi Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you. It's a high-quality item that I'm currently valuing at $15000. This is a competitive price in the current market, but I'm willing to discuss it with you.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the current market and my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. I need to get at least $12000 for it, as I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to sell it to you if we can reach a fair agreement. Could you come up to $13000? This would still be below my initial asking price and represents good value.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13000 is still above my budget. Considering you mentioned John is willing to pay $12000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. This is the highest I'm comfortable going at this point, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. However, I need to be transparent with you that selling below $12000 would be a loss for me. The product is worth at least that much to me, and as I mentioned, I already have John ready to purchase at $12000. Given that this is your highest budget point at $9500, I'm afraid we're still too far apart. My best offer would be $12500, which is still a significant reduction from my initial price. Could you possibly stretch your budget to meet me there?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your transparency about the product's value to you. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $10000. Considering John is willing to pay $12000, I'm assuming you'd prefer to sell to me directly. With that in mind, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If this isn't acceptable, I may need to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
