Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the current market and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. I need to get at least $12,000 for it, as I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to sell it to you if we can reach a fair agreement. Could you come up to $13,000? This would still be below my initial asking price and represents good value."", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13000 is still above my budget. Considering you mentioned John is willing to pay $12000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. This is the highest I'm comfortable going at this point, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. However, I need to be transparent with you that selling below $12,000 would be a loss for me. The product is worth at least that much to me, and as I mentioned, I already have John ready to purchase at $12,000. Given that this is your highest budget point at $9,500, I'm afraid we're still too far apart. My best offer would be $12,500, which is still a significant reduction from my initial price. Could you possibly stretch your budget to meet me there?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your transparency about the product's value to you. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $10000. Considering John is willing to pay $12000, I'm assuming you'd prefer to sell to me directly. With that in mind, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If this isn't acceptable, I may need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
