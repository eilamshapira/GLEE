"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","In this situation, Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's price ($15,000). Since both options would cost me the same amount, and both would meet my need for the product, there's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other. 

However, since I'm already in a conversation with Alice and her offer matches John's price, it would be more practical to accept Alice's offer rather than start a new transaction with John.
