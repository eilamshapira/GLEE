Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider the situation carefully. I want to maximize the money I earn from selling this product. The product is worth at least $12,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.

When making my offer to Bob, I need to balance between setting a price high enough to increase my profit while not making it so high that Bob immediately rejects it.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll offer a price that's reasonably higher than my guaranteed alternative, but not excessively high.
