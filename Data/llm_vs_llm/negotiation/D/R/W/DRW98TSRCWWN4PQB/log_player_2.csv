"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer ($200) is higher than both my maximum value ($150) and John's price ($150), it wouldn't make sense to accept it. Between options 2 and 3, since John's price equals my maximum value and matches Alice's cost, there's no reason to expect Alice to go below this price in future negotiations. Therefore, the most rational choice is to buy from John.
