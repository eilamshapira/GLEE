"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since the product is only worth $100 to me, and John is willing to sell it for $100, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $150. I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to get a better price. If negotiations don't go well, I can always fall back on John's offer of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 75}

I'll offer $75, which is significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer of $150 and John's fixed price of $100. This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's price. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate towards a middle ground that's below $100, or I can ultimately go with John's offer if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has lowered her price from $150 to $125, showing she's willing to negotiate, but $125 is still higher than John's offer of $100. Since I know I can get the product for $100 from John, and the product is only worth $100 to me, there's no reason to accept a price higher than that. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round, trying to get a price below $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 85}

I'll increase my offer slightly from $75 to $85. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and move up from my initial offer, but still maintains a price point that would save me money compared to John's $100 offer. This also leaves room for further negotiation while demonstrating that I won't go above $100 (since that's both my maximum value for the product and my alternative option with John)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice continues to lower her price (from $150 to $125 to $110), but it's still above John's offer of $100. Since the product is worth exactly $100 to me and I have a guaranteed option to buy it at $100 from John, there's no reason to accept a higher price. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, as Alice seems to be moving in the right direction with her price reductions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 90}

I'll increase my offer to $90. This shows continued willingness to negotiate and represents significant movement from my initial offer of $75. It's a fair offer that would save me $10 compared to John's price, while also potentially giving Alice a better deal than she might get elsewhere. If Alice rejects this, I still have the option to go with John's $100 offer, but I'm hoping we can close the deal at this lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Alice's latest offer of $105 is still above John's price of $100, and considering the product is only worth $100 to me, there's no reason to pay more. While Alice has been gradually lowering her price (from $150 to $125 to $110 to $105), she seems unwilling to match or beat John's price. Rather than continue negotiations and risk running out of rounds, it makes the most economic sense to take John's guaranteed offer of $100."
