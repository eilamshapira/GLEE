"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $14,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and benefits."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer in the next round. $9,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and since I have John's guaranteed offer at $12,000, I won't accept anything lower than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot go that low. The product's value and quality justify a higher price. While I understand you're on a budget, my absolute minimum price would be $12,500, which is still a fair price considering the market value. Would you be able to meet me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I need to stick to my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10500?  That's the most I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $12,000. Bob's maximum offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and since John is willing to pay $12,000, that's the better option for me. There's no point in continuing negotiations when Bob's budget constraint means he can't meet my minimum price requirement."
