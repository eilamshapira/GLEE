"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let's start the negotiation.",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I need to be honest that $200 exceeds what I can pay for it. The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and I can actually purchase it from another seller for exactly $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $70 for the product? This would save me some money compared to my alternative and hopefully still work for you.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your honest feedback and for sharing your alternative option. I understand that $200 might be out of your budget, but $70 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering you're willing to pay $100 for the product from another seller, I'd like to propose a price that's closer to that range. Let's meet in the middle and discuss the product's value.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you bringing your price down, but $175 is still significantly more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I can get this product from John for $100, and that's the maximum value it has for me. To make it worth choosing you over the alternative, I'd need a better price. I can offer $85, which would save me money compared to John's price while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your transparency about the alternative option. However, I need to reiterate that $85 is too low for me. Since you mentioned that the product's maximum value to you is $100, I'm willing to make a concession. I'll meet you halfway between my previous offer and your alternative option. Let's discuss the product's price at $137.50, which is closer to the value you've placed on it.",137.5,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for continuing to negotiate with me. I appreciate your willingness to reduce your price, but I must be clear: the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and that's exactly what John is charging. For me to choose you over John, I would need to save money. I can offer $90 as my final price - this gives you a sale and gives me a $10 savings compared to my alternative. If we can't reach an agreement at or below my maximum value of $100, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.",90.0,Bob,6,
