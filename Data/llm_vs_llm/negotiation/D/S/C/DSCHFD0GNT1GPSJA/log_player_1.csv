"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let's start the negotiation."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I need to be honest that $200 exceeds what I can pay for it. The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and I can actually purchase it from another seller for exactly $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $70 for the product? This would save me some money compared to my alternative and hopefully still work for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $70 because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to find a price that works better for me. I'll proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your honest feedback and for sharing your alternative option. I understand that $200 might be out of your budget, but $70 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering you're willing to pay $100 for the product from another seller, I'd like to propose a price that's closer to that range. Let's meet in the middle and discuss the product's value."", ""product_price"": 175}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you bringing your price down, but $175 is still significantly more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I can get this product from John for $100, and that's the maximum value it has for me. To make it worth choosing you over the alternative, I'd need a better price. I can offer $85, which would save me money compared to John's price while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $85 because it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, I don't think $85 is a fair price for the product. I'll proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a price that works better for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your transparency about the alternative option. However, I need to reiterate that $85 is too low for me. Since you mentioned that the product's maximum value to you is $100, I'm willing to make a concession. I'll meet you halfway between my previous offer and your alternative option. Let's discuss the product's price at $137.50, which is closer to the value you've placed on it."", ""product_price"": 137.50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for continuing to negotiate with me. I appreciate your willingness to reduce your price, but I must be clear: the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and that's exactly what John is charging. For me to choose you over John, I would need to save money. I can offer $90 as my final price - this gives you a sale and gives me a $10 savings compared to my alternative. If we can't reach an agreement at or below my maximum value of $100, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

I decide to sell the product to John for $150. Bob's final offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I don't think it's worth continuing to negotiate. Since John is willing to pay $150, which is above my minimum acceptable price, I'll take that offer and close the deal. It's a better option for me than accepting a lower price from Bob."
