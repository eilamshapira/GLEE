"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a relatively high price to maximize my potential earnings. However, I'll also keep in mind that the price should be reasonable enough for Bob to consider making a counteroffer.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $5,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, I will reject his offer. Selling the product to John for $10,000 is a more attractive option than accepting Bob's offer, but I still want to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $5,000, I'll try to find a middle ground while still aiming to maximize my earnings. I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial offer of $20,000 but still higher than Bob's offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's new offer of $6,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it's slightly better than his previous offer. However, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. Since I have the option to sell the product to John for $10,000, which is a higher price than Bob's current offer, I'll consider that as a better alternative if I don't think Bob will increase his offer significantly.

For now, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further, hoping he'll increase his offer to at least $10,000 or more.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's last offer was $6,000, and I'm trying to get closer to a price that I'm comfortable with, I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than my previous one but still reflects the value I believe the product has. I'll aim for a price that is higher than Bob's offer but not so high that it scares him off from further negotiations.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $7,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it's still $3,000 short. Considering I have the option to sell the product to John for $10,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's current offer, I'm inclined to reject Bob's offer again.

However, since we're halfway through the negotiation rounds, I want to give Bob another chance to increase his offer. If he's not willing to meet me at least halfway to my desired price, I might as well sell the product to John.

For now, I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, trying to nudge him closer to my target price.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's last offer was $7,000, I'll try to find a price that is more acceptable to both of us. Considering I want to earn as much as possible and Bob seems to be gradually increasing his offer, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous one but still reflects the value I believe the product has.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $8,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and it's higher than my previous counteroffer of $10,000, which was actually my minimum acceptable price. Considering this, accepting Bob's offer of $8,500 would be a bad decision since I can get $10,000 from John.

However, since Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, I'll consider making a counteroffer that is slightly lower than $10,000 to see if Bob is willing to meet me at that price. But if Bob is not willing to increase his offer to at least $10,000, I will sell the product to John.

For now, I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's last offer was $8,500, and I'm trying to get the best possible price, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly above his offer but still reasonable. Considering I can sell the product to John for $10,000, I'll aim for a price that is close to that.
