"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13500 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $11000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $11000 is simply too low for me. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $11000 is not an option.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12250?",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to negotiate.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to sell the product for $12500.  That's a good price for you, and it's still a fair price for me. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate it, but $12500 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $11500? That way, we both get a good deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $11500, but it's still below what I need to get for this product. How about we split the difference and go with $12000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $12000 is the lowest I can go.  It's a fair price, and it gives you a great product at a good value.  Let's close this deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,
