Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what price to offer Bob for the product. The product is worth at least $8,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $8,000 if Bob rejects my offer.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I should offer a price higher than $8,000 to try to maximize my profit, while not setting the price so high that Bob is almost certain to reject it.

I'll set a price of $12,000, which gives me a significant premium over my guaranteed $8,000 alternative, but isn't so excessive that it would automatically drive Bob away if he values the product highly.
