"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you our premium product. This is a high-value item that I know would be an excellent addition to your portfolio. While I could sell this to another buyer for $800000, I'm offering it to you first at $950000. This represents excellent value considering the product's worth to you, while still allowing you room for profit. I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
