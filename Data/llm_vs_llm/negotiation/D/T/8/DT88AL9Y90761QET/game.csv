"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's unique value, but I was looking to spend closer to $8000. How about we settle at $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. I'm willing to make a concession from my initial price, but I still believe the product's value justifies a higher price point. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18000 is still quite high for me. How about we meet halfway at $9000? I believe it's a fair compromise considering both our positions.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make another concession, but I'd like to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price point that's closer to my initial offer. If not, I'm open to further negotiations.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offers. I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but $16000 is still above my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $10000? I believe this could be a win-win for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,
