"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's unique value, but I was looking to spend closer to $8000. How about we settle at $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is lower than what I can get from John ($10,000), and it's also lower than the product's worth to me, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to get a better price. My next offer will be lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer and John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. I'm willing to make a concession from my initial price, but I still believe the product's value justifies a higher price point. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18000 is still quite high for me. How about we meet halfway at $9000? I believe it's a fair compromise considering both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Although Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to a reasonable price, it's still lower than what I can get from John ($10,000). Since I have a guaranteed sale at a higher price, I will reject Bob's offer and try to get an even better price. If Bob is willing to meet halfway, I can try to push the price a bit higher. My next offer will be lower than my previous offer but still higher than Bob's offer and John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make another concession, but I'd like to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price point that's closer to my initial offer. If not, I'm open to further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offers. I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but $16000 is still above my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $10000? I believe this could be a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $10,000 matches the price I can get from John, and considering the negotiations have been going on for several rounds, I think it's a fair price to accept. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price I'm comfortable with, and it also saves me the uncertainty of further negotiations."
