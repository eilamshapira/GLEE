"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice is selling a product that costs her $12,000, and I know I have a maximum value of $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Alice's current offer of $14,500 is too close to my maximum value and only slightly better than John's price of $15,000. By rejecting and making a counteroffer, I can try to get a better price that's closer to the middle ground between $12,000 and $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm offering $13,000, which is a fair price because:
1. It's $1,000 above Alice's cost ($12,000), giving her a reasonable profit
2. It's $2,000 less than John's price ($15,000)
3. It's in the middle range between Alice's cost and my maximum value
This offer gives both parties room to negotiate while being a reasonable starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $14,000 because:
1. Alice has moved down significantly from her initial offer of $14,500
2. It's $1,000 less than John's price ($15,000)
3. While we might continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice could become less flexible, and we might lose the opportunity for this decent price
4. The price represents a reasonable compromise - Alice makes a profit above her $12,000 cost, and I save money compared to my maximum budget of $15,000"
