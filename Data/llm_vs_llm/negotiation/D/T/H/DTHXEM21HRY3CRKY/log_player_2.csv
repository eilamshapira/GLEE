"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Based on the information provided, let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: Buy the product for $200
2. Reject Alice's offer: Don't buy from Alice
3. Buy from John for $150

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and John is offering the product for exactly $150, it makes no sense to pay $200 to Alice. The rational choice would be to buy from John and save $50.
