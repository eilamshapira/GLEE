Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was hoping to spend less. Would you consider selling the product for $7000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price. My counteroffer will be $9,000. This is still below the value Bob has for the product ($10,000), but closer to my initial offer. 

{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend less, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. It's a great product and I believe it's worth it."", ""product_price"": 9000}"

Bob's offer:

Since Bob's offer is $8,000, which is the same price John is willing to pay, and I don't have to go through any further negotiation, I can sell the product to John for $8,000. This guarantees me the sale at a price that meets my minimum requirement without the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price."
