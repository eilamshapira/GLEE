"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but $200 is quite high for my budget. I'm looking to spend no more than $60 for this product. That's a fair price based on my research and what I'm willing to spend. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this price. ",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that, but $120 is still more than I can spend on this product. I know I can get it for $80 elsewhere, which is my absolute maximum budget. To keep things simple and save us both time, I can offer you $70. That would be better for me than my alternative option, and we could close the deal right now. What do you say?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $70 is just not a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",100.0,Alice,5,
