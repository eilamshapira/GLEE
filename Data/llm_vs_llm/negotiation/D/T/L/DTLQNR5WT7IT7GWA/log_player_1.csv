Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $200 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but $200 is quite high for my budget. I'm looking to spend no more than $60 for this product. That's a fair price based on my research and what I'm willing to spend. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give it away for a third of what it's worth.  I'll counter with a higher price, but if he continues to low-ball me, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this price. "", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that, but $120 is still more than I can spend on this product. I know I can get it for $80 elsewhere, which is my absolute maximum budget. To keep things simple and save us both time, I can offer you $70. That would be better for me than my alternative option, and we could close the deal right now. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not going to sell my product for less than $100. I'll counter with that price and see if he's willing to meet me halfway. If not, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $70 is just not a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 100}
