"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $200 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to consider my options carefully here:

1. Alice is offering the product for $200, which is significantly above my maximum value of $80.
2. John is willing to sell me the same product for $80, which is exactly my maximum value.
3. I could try negotiating with Alice to get a better price.

Since Alice's initial offer is much higher than both my maximum value and John's alternative price, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but $200 is quite high for my budget. I'm looking to spend no more than $60 for this product. That's a fair price based on my research and what I'm willing to spend. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this price.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to evaluate my options carefully:

1. Alice's new offer is $120, which is still above my maximum value of $80.
2. John is offering the product for $80, which is exactly my maximum value.
3. I could try one more round of negotiation with Alice.

Since Alice's current offer ($120) is still higher than both my maximum value and John's price, I should reject this offer and try one more counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that, but $120 is still more than I can spend on this product. I know I can get it for $80 elsewhere, which is my absolute maximum budget. To keep things simple and save us both time, I can offer you $70. That would be better for me than my alternative option, and we could close the deal right now. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $70 is just not a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. Let me know if you're interested in this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Looking at my options:

1. Alice's new offer is $100, which is still above my maximum value of $80 and above what John is charging.
2. John is offering the product for $80, which is my maximum value.
3. I could try another round of negotiation, but Alice has only come down to $100 after multiple rounds.

Since John's offer is better than Alice's current price, and I know I can get the product at exactly my maximum value, I should take the sure option.
