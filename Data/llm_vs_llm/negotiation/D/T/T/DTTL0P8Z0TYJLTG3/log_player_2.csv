"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer compared to John's offer and my maximum value for the product.

Alice is offering the product for $14,999, while John is offering it for $15,000. 

Since the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $1 cheaper than John's offer, it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer.
