"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for round 1:

```json
{
  ""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to finally offer you this incredible product! Based on its value and the exclusive nature of this offer, I'm willing to sell it to you for a price of $1,200,000. Let me know what you think."",
  ""product_price"": 1200000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, my budget for this purchase is significantly lower. I can offer you $700000 for it. Please let me know if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Okay, here's my decision and rationale for Round 2:

Given Bob's counteroffer of $700,000, which is less than what the product is worth to me, and less than the offer from John, I will not accept it. My goal is to maximize my profit, and John's offer is currently better.

Therefore:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for Round 3:

```json
{
  ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $700,000 is too low. Given the product's value and scarcity, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. What do you say?"",
  ""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still quite far from my budget, though. Would you consider $750000? This is closer to what I'm able to pay at this moment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Here's my decision for Round 4:

Bob's offer of $750,000 is still less than John's offer of $1,000,000. I will choose to reject this offer and keep negotiating.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer to Bob for Round 5:

```json
{
  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand that price is important. However, I can't sell the product at that price. To make this work, and to show I am serious about selling to you, I will offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go. Let me know your thoughts."",
  ""product_price"": 1050000
}
