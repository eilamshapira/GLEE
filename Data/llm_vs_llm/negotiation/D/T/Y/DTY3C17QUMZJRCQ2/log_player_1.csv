Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","While $100 is a decent offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation since the product is worth $120 to Bob. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","The negotiation seems to be moving in small increments, and we're already at round 4 out of 10. $95 is a reasonable offer that gives me a good profit margin above my minimum of $80. While I might be able to get a slightly better price by continuing to negotiate, there's also a risk of Bob getting frustrated and walking away. I'll accept this offer.
