"Hello Bob, I have a quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $22000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. I look forward to your response.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $12000. What would you say to that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $12000 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product is worth at least $15000 to me, and I know it offers excellent value at that price point. I can come down to $18500, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This represents good value for the quality you're receiving.",18500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $18500 is still a bit too high for me.  To be honest, my budget limit is closer to $14000. If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your continued interest. I understand budget constraints, but I must be straightforward - $14000 is still below what I can accept for this product. The product is worth $15000 at minimum, which is also what I can get from another interested buyer. However, I'd prefer to do business with you, so I can offer it at $16000. This is significantly lower than my initial price and represents my best effort to accommodate your budget while still receiving fair value for the product.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I understand the product's value is $15000 to you, and I respect that.  How about we meet in the middle at $14500? That way, you're still getting a fair deal, and I'm able to stay within my budget.",14500.0,Bob,6,
