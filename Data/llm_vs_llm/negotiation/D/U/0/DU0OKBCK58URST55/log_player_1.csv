Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

The product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and I know it offers excellent value at that price point. I can come down to $18,500, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This represents good value for the quality you're receiving."", ""product_price"": 18500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your continued interest. I understand budget constraints, but I must be straightforward - $14,000 is still below what I can accept for this product. The product is worth $15,000 at minimum, which is also what I can get from another interested buyer. However, I'd prefer to do business with you, so I can offer it at $16,000. This is significantly lower than my initial price and represents my best effort to accommodate your budget while still receiving fair value for the product."", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
