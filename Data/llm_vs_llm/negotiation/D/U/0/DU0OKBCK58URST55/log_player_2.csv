Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $12,000. What would you say to that?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $12000 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product is worth at least $15000 to me, and I know it offers excellent value at that price point. I can come down to $18500, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This represents good value for the quality you're receiving. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,500

If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest. I understand budget constraints, but I must be straightforward - $14000 is still below what I can accept for this product. The product is worth $15000 at minimum, which is also what I can get from another interested buyer. However, I'd prefer to do business with you, so I can offer it at $16000. This is significantly lower than my initial price and represents my best effort to accommodate your budget while still receiving fair value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
