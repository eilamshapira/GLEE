"Hello Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd be interested in.  It's valued at no less than $10000 to me, but I'm open to negotiation.  My initial offer is $15000.  Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, though, so I'd be willing to pay $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  $12000 is a little lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $13500.  Let me know if that works for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $13000? ",13000.0,Bob,4,
