"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited you're interested in this unique opportunity. Given its exceptional value and potential for significant returns, I'm offering it to you for $3000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","The offer of $3,000,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,200,000, and it's also much higher than John's price. Since Alice's initial offer is more than double what I can get from John, it's clear that accepting Alice's offer would be a poor decision. While I could reject and make a counteroffer, given the large gap between Alice's asking price and John's price, it would be most rational to simply buy from John.
