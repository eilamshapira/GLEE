,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $20000 is quite beyond my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $9000? I believe this is a fair price and it would help us reach a quick agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9000 is considerably below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $17000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand where you're coming from. However, $17000 is still more than I can afford. How about we settle at $10000? I think this price would be beneficial for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
