,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9000?  It's still a great deal for you, and a fair price for me. Let's see if we can close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your revised offer. I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8750. This way, we can both get a fair deal. Let me know if this works for you.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. $8750 is still a bit low for me. Let's compromise at $8900. It's a good price for both of us and we can finally close this deal.",8900.0,Alice,5,
