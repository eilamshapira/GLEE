"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since the product is worth $10,000 to me and Alice's initial offer is $9,500, which is close to the maximum I'm willing to pay, I'll consider rejecting the offer to see if I can get a better deal. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since Alice's offer was $9,500 and the product is worth $8,000 to her, I'll aim for a price that is closer to the midpoint of my maximum budget and Alice's minimum value.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9000?  It's still a great deal for you, and a fair price for me. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but it's getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with. Since I know that the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, I'll try to make another counteroffer to see if I can get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous offer, but still lower than Alice's current offer. This will show that I'm willing to negotiate and meet Alice halfway.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your revised offer. I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,750. This way, we can both get a fair deal. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 8750}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. $8750 is still a bit low for me. Let's compromise at $8900. It's a good price for both of us and we can finally close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $8,900 is getting very close to a price that I'm comfortable with. Considering that the product is worth $10,000 to me and Alice's offer is only $100 more than my previous counteroffer, I think it's a good deal. I'll accept Alice's offer to avoid the risk of further negotiations not going in my favor.
