I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than I would from selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $750,000 and countering with $850,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation while ensuring I get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm not entirely happy with Bob's offer, I'm worried that continuing to negotiate will only drive the price lower. I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $1,000,000, ensuring I reach my minimum acceptable price.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John."
