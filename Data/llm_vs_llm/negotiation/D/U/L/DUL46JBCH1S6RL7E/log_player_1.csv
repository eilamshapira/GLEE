Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. Given that:
1. I have a guaranteed backup offer of $1,500,000 from John
2. Bob's valuation is unknown
3. I only have one chance to make an offer

I should set a price significantly higher than my guaranteed $1,500,000 to maximize my potential profit, while still keeping it within a reasonable range that a buyer might accept.
