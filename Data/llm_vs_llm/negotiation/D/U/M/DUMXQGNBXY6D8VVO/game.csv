"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $6000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $6000 is too low for the value of this product. How about we agree on a price of $13500? I believe this is a fair price for the quality and value you're receiving.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $13500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $7000, which is the highest I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to consider this price?",7000.0,Bob,4,
