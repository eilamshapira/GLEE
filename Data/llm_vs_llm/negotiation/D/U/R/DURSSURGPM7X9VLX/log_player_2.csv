"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Considering the options:

*   **(1) Accept Alice's offer:** This would cost me $14,500.
*   **(3) Buy the product from John:** This would cost me $15,000.
*   **(2) Reject Alice's offer:** I can potentially get a better price from Alice in the next rounds, but there's a risk of not reaching a deal.

Since the product is worth $15,000 to me and the current offer from Alice is $14,500, accepting her offer seems like a good idea.
