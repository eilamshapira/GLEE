"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000), I will reject her offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. This gives me a chance to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000, I'll offer a price that is slightly lower than that.
