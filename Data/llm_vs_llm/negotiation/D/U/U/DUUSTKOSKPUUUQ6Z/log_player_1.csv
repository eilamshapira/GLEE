"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my counteroffer, Alice. I understand that we both want to find a good deal. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $9,000 because it's lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $10,000. I'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding, Alice. I want to ensure we both get a fair deal. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I hope it shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $10,000 matches the minimum value I have for the product and is the same price I would get from selling to John, I'm willing to accept this offer. It seems we've reached a fair price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by pushing for more and potentially having Bob walk away."
