"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $7500 is too low for this product. I know its true value in the market. I can come down from my initial price, but I cannot go below $8800. This is already a significant reduction from my first offer, and it's a fair price for the value you'll receive.",8800.0,Alice,3,
