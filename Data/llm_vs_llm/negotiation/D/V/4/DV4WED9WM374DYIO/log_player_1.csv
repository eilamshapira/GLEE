"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be perfect for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice, but I was hoping for a better price. Would you consider $7500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will propose a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and I know I can get $8,000 from John. However, I'll try to negotiate with Bob for a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $7,500 is too low for this product. I know its true value in the market. I can come down from my initial price, but I cannot go below $8,800. This is already a significant reduction from my first offer, and it's a fair price for the value you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 8800}"
