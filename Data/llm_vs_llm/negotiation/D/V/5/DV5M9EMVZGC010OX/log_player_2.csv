"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Looking at the situation:

- Alice is offering the product for $120
- The product is worth no more than $120 to me (Bob)
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $120

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($120), and the product is worth $120 to me, I'm indifferent between the two sellers. There's no financial advantage in choosing one over the other.
