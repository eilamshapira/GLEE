"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a great product that I think you'll find valuable. I can offer it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to evaluate if Alice's offer is a good deal for me.

Alice is offering the product for $120. However, the product is only worth $80 to me, and I can buy it from John for exactly $80.

Since Alice's price ($120) exceeds both the value to me ($80) and John's alternative price ($80), it makes the most sense to buy from John.
