"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $18500 is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand budget constraints, $12000 is too low considering the product's value. I can come down significantly from my initial offer, but I would need $16000 for this product. This is still a very competitive price for what you're getting. Would this work for you?",16000.0,Alice,3,
