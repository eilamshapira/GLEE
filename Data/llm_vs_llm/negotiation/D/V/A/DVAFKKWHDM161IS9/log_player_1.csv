Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it for $18,500. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value. Would you like to proceed with the purchase?"", ""product_price"": 18500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $18500 is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, as $12,000 is still quite low compared to my initial offer. Since Bob is showing interest and willing to negotiate, there's potential to reach a better price than both his offer and John's guaranteed $10,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand budget constraints, $12,000 is too low considering the product's value. I can come down significantly from my initial offer, but I would need $16,000 for this product. This is still a very competitive price for what you're getting. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
