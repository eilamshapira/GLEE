"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it for $18500. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me. Alice is offering it for $18,500. This is more than what it's worth to me. I will not accept the offer, and I will not buy from Jhon yet. I will reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can agree on a price closer to my valuation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, I'll start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price, hoping to negotiate towards a mutually acceptable price.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,500 is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand budget constraints, $12000 is too low considering the product's value. I can come down significantly from my initial offer, but I would need $16000 for this product. This is still a very competitive price for what you're getting. Would this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down to $16,000, but that's still above my maximum valuation of $15,000. Since I can buy from John for $15,000, I will do that.
