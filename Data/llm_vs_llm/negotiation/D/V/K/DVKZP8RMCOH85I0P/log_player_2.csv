"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has tremendous value, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully:

1. The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $3,000,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $1,500,000

Alice's offer is twice the price of John's offer and twice what the product is worth to me. This doesn't make financial sense for me.
