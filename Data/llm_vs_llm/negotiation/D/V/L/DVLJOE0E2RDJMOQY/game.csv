"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in.  It's worth at least $100 to me, and I'm willing to let it go for $120.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $105?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $105, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. How about $90 for the product?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $90 is closer, but I'm still a bit far from what I need.  Would you be willing to go up to $95?  That would be a fair compromise, and we could both be happy with the deal.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to go up a bit from my previous offer, but I'd like to meet in the middle between $90 and $95. How about $92.50 for the product?",92.5,Bob,6,
