"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'll find very valuable. How about I offer it to you for $200?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit higher than I can go. How about $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Okay, considering the situation and my minimum acceptable price of $100, I need to make a careful decision. Bob is offering $120, which is more than John's offer. I also have many rounds to go.

Therefore:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
