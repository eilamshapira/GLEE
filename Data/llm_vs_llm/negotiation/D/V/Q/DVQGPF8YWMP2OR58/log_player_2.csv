"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of the product. I can offer it to you for $1500000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,500,000 is significantly above both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's alternative price ($1,000,000). It would not be rational to accept this offer when I have a better alternative. I'll reject and make a counteroffer, as there might be room for negotiation with Alice, but if we can't reach a better price, I can always go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,500,000 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. I have another seller offering the same product for $1,000,000, but I'd like to work with you if possible. Would you consider selling the product for $900,000? This would allow us both to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
