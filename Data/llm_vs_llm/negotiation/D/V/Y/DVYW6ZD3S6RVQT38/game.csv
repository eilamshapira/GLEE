"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $14000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. While I understand budget constraints, $8500 is significantly below the product's value. I can come down from my initial price, but I couldn't go below $13000 given the product's quality and market value. Would this work better for you?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $9500.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",9500.0,Bob,4,
