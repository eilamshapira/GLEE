Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $14,000. This is a fair price considering its features and benefits. Would you be interested?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $14000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $8,500 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and even below John's guaranteed offer of $12,000, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to Bob. If we can't reach an agreement that's above $12,000, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. While I understand budget constraints, $8,500 is significantly below the product's value. I can come down from my initial price, but I couldn't go below $13,000 given the product's quality and market value. Would this work better for you?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $9500.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's highest offer ($9,500) is still well below John's guaranteed offer of $12,000, and Bob seems unlikely to raise his offer above $12,000 (given that the product is only worth $8,000 to him), the most profitable decision is to sell to John for $12,000."
