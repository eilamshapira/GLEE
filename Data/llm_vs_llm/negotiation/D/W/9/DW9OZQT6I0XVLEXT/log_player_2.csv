"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'd like to offer you.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it could be even more valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $15000, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

Let's start the negotiation.

**Your counteroffer:**
What about $10,000?"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I was thinking of something more around $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  While $10000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $12000 to see if we can reach an agreement. This reflects the unique value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer is not lower than John's, I'll just buy from John."
