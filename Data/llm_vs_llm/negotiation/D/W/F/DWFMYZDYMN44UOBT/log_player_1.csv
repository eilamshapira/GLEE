"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $65 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and I have the option to sell to John for $100, I will consider my next steps carefully.

Given that I have 9 more rounds to negotiate and Bob's initial offer is $65, which is closer to his valuation of $80 than to my minimum price, I will try to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price.

Therefore, my decision for Round 2 is to reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $65 and his valuation of the product is $80, I will try to meet him halfway between his offer and my initial offer of $100, while also considering my minimum acceptable price.

My counteroffer will be slightly lower than my initial offer, to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but still high enough to ensure I'm getting a good deal.

{""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's new offer of $70 is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it's slightly closer to his valuation of $80. Since I have the option to sell to John for $100, I'm not in a hurry to accept a lower offer.

However, I also don't want to lose the opportunity to sell to Bob if he's willing to negotiate further. Given that Bob has increased his offer from $65 to $70, it shows that he's willing to compromise.

I'll reject Bob's offer again and try to make another counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one, to see if I can get closer to a mutually acceptable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""product_price"": 90}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I've already sent my counteroffer in the previous message. To reiterate:

{""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's new offer of $75 is getting closer to his valuation of $80, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. However, I notice that Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which suggests that he's interested in buying the product and willing to negotiate.

At this point, I have to weigh the potential of getting a better offer from Bob against the certainty of selling to John for $100. Since Bob's offer is still $25 away from my minimum acceptable price, I'm not confident that he'll meet my price in the remaining rounds.

Given the options, I think it's time to consider selling to John, as his offer of $100 is more attractive than Bob's current offer of $75.
