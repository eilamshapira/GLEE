"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer of $100 is higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80), it would not be rational to accept it. Given that John offers $80, which is equal to my maximum value, I should either negotiate with Alice for a better price or buy from John. Since I have multiple rounds to negotiate and might get a better deal from Alice, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $100 to Alice and $80 to me, I'll start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation. I'll offer $65, which is significantly below both Alice's value and John's price, giving room for negotiation upward while potentially getting a better deal than John's $80.

{""product_price"": 65}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $95 is still above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). While Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate by lowering the price from $100 to $95, this price is still not acceptable. Since I can always buy from John for $80, and I still have several rounds to negotiate with Alice, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down from $100 to $95, showing some flexibility, I'll increase my previous offer but still try to get a better deal than John's $80. I'll offer $70, which is a reasonable increase from my previous offer of $65 and still leaves room for negotiation while potentially getting a better price than John's offer.

{""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer of $90 is still above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). While Alice continues to lower her price (from $100 to $95 to $90), showing good faith in negotiations, this price is still not acceptable. Since I can still buy from John for $80, and I still have rounds remaining to negotiate with Alice, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has shown a pattern of reducing her price by $5 each time (from $100 to $95 to $90). I've moved up from $65 to $70 in my previous offers. To show good faith and move towards a middle ground, I'll increase my offer to $75, which is still below John's price of $80 but represents a meaningful increase from my previous offer.
