Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic decision for my first offer to Bob. The product is worth $150 to Bob and $120 to me (my reservation price). I want to maximize my profit while giving Bob enough incentive to accept.

If I start too high, Bob might reject and counter with a lower price. If I start too low, I'm leaving money on the table. I have John as a backup who will pay $120, so I won't accept anything below that.

I'll start with a price that gives Bob some value but still gives me a good profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","I need to evaluate my options carefully. Bob countered with $125, which is above my minimum acceptable price of $120, but only by $5. Let me analyze:

1. Accept Bob's offer ($125): This gives me $5 more than my reservation price
2. Sell to John ($120): This is my guaranteed fallback option
3. Make a counteroffer: This could potentially get me more than $125, but risks Bob walking away

Since Bob countered my initial offer of $140 with $125, there's room for negotiation. The gap between our positions ($15) suggests Bob is willing to negotiate but wants a better deal. I believe I can counter with a price between our positions that still gives me more profit than accepting his current offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob countered my initial $140 offer with $125, I'll try to meet somewhere in the middle. I know Bob values the product at $150, and my minimum is $120. His counter of $125 is quite close to my minimum, but I believe there's still room to negotiate upward.

I'll propose a price that's closer to the middle point between our last positions ($140 and $125), which gives both of us some value:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","I need to carefully evaluate this situation. Bob has now lowered his offer to $120, which is exactly equal to my reservation price and exactly equal to what John is willing to pay.

Let me consider my options:
1. Accept Bob's offer ($120): This gives me exactly my reservation price
2. Sell to John ($120): This also gives me exactly my reservation price
3. Make a counteroffer: This risks Bob walking away completely, but could potentially get me more

Since Bob's offer has dropped from $125 to $120, he seems to be playing hardball and may be unwilling to pay more. The fact that his offer now equals my outside option (John's offer) means there's no advantage to accepting Bob's offer over selling to John.

In this case, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Bob since he's offering the same as my guaranteed alternative.
