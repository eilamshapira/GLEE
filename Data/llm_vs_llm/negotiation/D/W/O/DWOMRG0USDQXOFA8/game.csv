"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you at a competitive price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I must say that $1200000 is significantly above my budget. I understand the product has value, but I need to be practical about my spending limits. I would like to make a counteroffer of $600000, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1200000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $600000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1100000, which I think is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $1100000 is still well beyond what I can justify spending. I need to be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $800000. I would prefer to do business with you, so I'm willing to offer $700000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in reaching a deal with you.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your updated offer and for being transparent about the other seller's price. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me, and I'm glad to see that you're increasing your offer. However, I still need to ensure that I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering your previous message, I'm willing to make a concession and lower my price to $1000000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I hope it's more in line with what you're looking to spend.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for working with me on the price, Alice. I appreciate your significant reduction, but I need to be firm about my budget constraints. Given that I can purchase the same product elsewhere for $800000, I can increase my offer to $750000. This is my best offer - it's significantly higher than my initial proposal and reflects my sincere desire to work with you. However, if we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll need to pursue the alternative option.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your updated offer and for being clear about your budget constraints. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $750000, and I'm glad to see that we're getting closer to a potential agreement. However, I still need to ensure that I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering your message, I'm willing to make another concession and lower my price to $950000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I hope it's more in line with what you're looking to spend. I'm trying to be flexible and work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Alice,7,
