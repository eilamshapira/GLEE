Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I must say that $1200000 is significantly above my budget. I understand the product has value, but I need to be practical about my spending limits. I would like to make a counteroffer of $600000, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

I reject Bob's offer of $600,000 because it's significantly lower than the product's worth to me. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to meet Bob halfway and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. My next offer will be $1100000."

I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000, which I think is a more reasonable price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $1100000 is still well beyond what I can justify spending. I need to be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $800000. I would prefer to do business with you, so I'm willing to offer $700000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in reaching a deal with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

I reject Bob's offer of $700,000 because it's still below my minimum acceptable price.

My next offer will be $1000000."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for working with me on the price, Alice. I appreciate your significant reduction, but I need to be firm about my budget constraints. Given that I can purchase the same product elsewhere for $800000, I can increase my offer to $750000. This is my best offer - it's significantly higher than my initial proposal and reflects my sincere desire to work with you. However, if we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll need to pursue the alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

I reject Bob's offer of $750,000 because it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I understand that Bob has budget constraints and an alternative option, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that low.
