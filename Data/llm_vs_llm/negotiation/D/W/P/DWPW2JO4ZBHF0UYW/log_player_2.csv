"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer ($1,800,000) is higher than both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's price ($1,500,000), I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer. If negotiations with Alice don't work out, I can always buy from John at $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'll offer $1,200,000. This is significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000, which gives me room to negotiate upward if needed. If Alice rejects this offer, I can still gradually increase my offer while maintaining the option to buy from John as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has lowered her price from $1,800,000 to $1,700,000, showing willingness to negotiate, but it's still higher than John's price of $1,500,000. Since I can get the product for $1,500,000 from John, there's no reason to accept a higher price. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, trying to get a better deal than John's price."

I'll increase my offer to $1,300,000, which is $100,000 more than my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate upward while still staying well below John's price of $1,500,000. If Alice rejects this, I still have room to negotiate further or can fall back on John's offer."
