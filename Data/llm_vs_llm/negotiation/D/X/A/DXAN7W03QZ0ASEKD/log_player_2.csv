"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think about this strategically:
1. The product is worth $100 to Alice
2. I won't pay more than $120 (my maximum value)
3. John's offer of $120 is my fallback option
4. Alice's offer of $115 is below my maximum but still leaves room for negotiation

Since this is just round 1 and Alice's initial offer of $115 is likely higher than what she might ultimately accept (given the product is worth $100 to her), I should try to negotiate for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably above Alice's cost ($100) but significantly lower than her initial offer ($115) to leave room for negotiation:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I think $115 is a bit high. Given the market value of similar products, I would be willing to pay $105 for it. This gives you a fair profit while being a reasonable price for me."", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Alice has moved down from $115 to $110, showing willingness to negotiate
2. $110 is better than John's price of $120
3. However, since the product costs Alice $100, there might still be room for negotiation
4. We're only in round 3 of 10, so there's time for more negotiation
5. Alice moved $5 down from her initial offer, suggesting she might be willing to move further

Given that we still have several rounds left and Alice has shown flexibility, I'll try one more negotiation round to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved $5 down from her initial offer, I'll also show some flexibility by moving up $2 from my last offer. This shows good faith in the negotiation while still trying to get a better deal:

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. Your product is certainly valuable, but I think $107 would be a more fair price for both of us. This gives you a good profit margin while being more reasonable for my budget."", ""product_price"": 107}"
