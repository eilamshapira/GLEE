"Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you find my previous offer a bit high. However, I think $90 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105? That way, we both give a little and get a good deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering I can buy the same product from John for $100, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $95. This is as high as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,
