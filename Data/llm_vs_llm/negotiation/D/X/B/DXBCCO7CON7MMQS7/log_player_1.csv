Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering I can buy the same product from John for $100, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $95. This is as high as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.
