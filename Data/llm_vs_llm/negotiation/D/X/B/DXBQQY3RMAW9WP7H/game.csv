"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about the product. However, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $100? ",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price. While $100 is the absolute minimum I could accept, I believe this product offers more value than that. I can come down to $135, which I think is a fair compromise considering the quality and features of the product. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $120.  It's a fair price considering we're both trying to find a good deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
