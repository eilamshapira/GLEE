Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price. While $100 is the absolute minimum I could accept, I believe this product offers more value than that. I can come down to $135, which I think is a fair compromise considering the quality and features of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
