You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $14,000 is a decent price and closer to your $15,000 limit, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go lower to make a profit.  I'll aim for a price closer to $12,000 in the next round."
