"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Looking at the details of this situation:

- The product is worth $80 to me (Bob)
- Alice is offering to sell me the product for $90
- John is offering to sell me the product for $80
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $80

Alice's offer ($90) exceeds both the value of the product to me ($80) and John's alternative price ($80). Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, the logical choice is to buy from John.
