"Hello Bob, I'm selling a high-quality product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it at $120. This is a premium item worth every dollar. Are you interested in purchasing at this price?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality you describe, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that price.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand $120 might seem high initially, but $80 is the absolute minimum I can accept, and I already have another buyer ready at that price. Given the quality and value of this product, I can offer it to you at $110. This is already a significant reduction from my initial price. Would this work for you?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is still too high for me. I'm still comfortable with $80. I understand you have another buyer, but perhaps we can find a compromise.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that price.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but I need to be straightforward. I can't go below $100 for this product given its quality and value. At $100, you're still getting an excellent deal - that's $20 less than my initial offer. If we can't reach an agreement at $100, I'll need to move forward with my other buyer. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
