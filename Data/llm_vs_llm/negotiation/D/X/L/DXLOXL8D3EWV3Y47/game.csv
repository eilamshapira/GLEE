"Hi Bob, thank you for getting back to me. I understand that you have a budget to maintain, but I believe the value of the product is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to lower my price to $1800000 to meet you halfway. I think this is a fair price considering the value and value you can get you and your company of the product. Please let me know if this works for you.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
