"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit high for me. Given that the market value is around $1500000, I'd like to propose $1300000, which would still give you a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1350000? That's still a good profit for me, and it's closer to what you're looking for. Let's close this deal!",1350000.0,Alice,3,
