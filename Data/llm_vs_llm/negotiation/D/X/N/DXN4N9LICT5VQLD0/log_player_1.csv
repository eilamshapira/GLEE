Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit high for me. Given that the market value is around $1500000, I'd like to propose $1300000, which would still give you a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
