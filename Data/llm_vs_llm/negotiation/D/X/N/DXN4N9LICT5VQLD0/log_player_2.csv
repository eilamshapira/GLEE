"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1500000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $1,500,000 to me (my maximum price)
2. Alice's cost is $1,200,000
3. Alice's current offer is $1,400,000
4. John's fixed price is $1,500,000

Alice's first offer of $1,400,000 is better than John's price ($1,500,000), but there's still room for negotiation since Alice's cost is $1,200,000. We have 10 rounds, so it's worth trying to negotiate for a better price. The worst case scenario is that I can always go to John if negotiations fail.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably lower but not insultingly low, considering Alice's cost of $1,200,000. I'll aim for a middle ground between Alice's cost and her initial offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Given that the market value is around $1,500,000, I'd like to propose $1,300,000, which would still give you a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1350000? That's still a good profit for me, and it's closer to what you're looking for. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze this new offer:

1. Alice has moved down from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. This is still $150,000 less than John's price ($1,500,000)
3. It's a $50,000 reduction from her initial offer
4. We still have 7 more rounds possible, but Alice is showing reasonable movement

While we might be able to negotiate further down, the risk is that too much haggling might lead to Alice becoming less flexible. The current offer of $1,350,000 is reasonable - it's significantly below my maximum price and represents a fair middle ground between Alice's cost ($1,200,000) and my maximum ($1,500,000).
