"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $200 is too high for me. The product is only worth $150 to me, and I can actually buy it from John for that price. However, I'd like to work with you. Would you consider selling it for $130? This would be a win-win as you'd make a quick sale, and I'd save some money compared to John's price.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but $130 is too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $170. This way, we both benefit from the transaction.",170.0,Alice,3,
