"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $200 is too high for me. The product is only worth $150 to me, and I can actually buy it from John for that price. However, I'd like to work with you. Would you consider selling it for $130? This would be a win-win as you'd make a quick sale, and I'd save some money compared to John's price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but $130 is too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $170. This way, we both benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 170}"
