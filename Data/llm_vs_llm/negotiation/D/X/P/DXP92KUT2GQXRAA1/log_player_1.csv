Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's premium quality, I find $2500000 to be significantly above my budget. I'm looking for a more competitive price. Given the market conditions and considering I have alternative options, I would like to offer $1200000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price and I understand the product's value. However, $2000000 is still beyond what I can justify for this purchase. I have other options available to me, including a verified offer at $1500000. However, I would prefer to do business with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I can increase my previous offer to $1350000, which I believe is a fair price that takes into account both the product's value and market conditions. Would this work for you?

I'm willing to continue negotiating in good faith, and can now offer the product at $1,750,000.
