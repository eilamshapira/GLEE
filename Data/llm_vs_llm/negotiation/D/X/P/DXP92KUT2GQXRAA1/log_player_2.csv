# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a premium product that offers exceptional value. Given its quality and market potential, I'm offering it to you for $2500000. This product represents a significant investment opportunity with substantial returns. Would you like to proceed with this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The offer of $2,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,500,000. It's even higher than John's guaranteed price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest and your offer. I understand budget considerations are important, and I appreciate your position. However, given the exceptional value and quality of this product, I cannot accept $1200000. After careful consideration of market conditions and the product's unique benefits, I can offer it to you for $2000000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial price and reflects my genuine interest in working with you. The product has substantial long-term value that justifies this investment. Would you consider this revised offer?

While Alice has reduced the price significantly from her initial offer, $2,000,000 is still above both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's guaranteed price ($1,500,000). I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a price below John's offer. If not, I can still take John's offer as a fallback option."

However, $2,000,000 is still beyond what I can justify for this purchase. I have other options available to me, including a verified offer at $1,500,000. However, I would prefer to do business with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I can increase my previous offer to $1,350,000, which I believe is a fair price that takes into account both the product's value and market conditions.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your increased offer and for sharing more context about your situation. I understand you have other options, including an offer at $1500000. While I appreciate your willingness to do business with me, I need to consider the true value of this product. I'm willing to continue negotiating in good faith, and can now offer the product at $1750000. This represents a substantial reduction from my previous offers and acknowledges your budget concerns while still reflecting the premium nature of this product. Given that you mentioned having a verified offer at $1500000, this price point should provide you with superior value compared to your alternatives. Would you consider this revised offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate and has reduced her price significantly, her current offer of $1,750,000 is still above my maximum value of $1,500,000. After several rounds of negotiation, it seems Alice is unlikely to go below John's price of $1,500,000. Since this price matches my maximum value and is lower than Alice's current offer, the most rational decision is to buy from John at $1,500,000."
