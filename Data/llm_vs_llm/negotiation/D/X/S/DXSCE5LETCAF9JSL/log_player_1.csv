Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price to offer Bob...

Bob values the product at $12,000, and I have a guaranteed backup offer of $8,000 from John. I want to maximize my profit while ensuring Bob is likely to accept.

The price should be below $12,000 (Bob's maximum value) but well above my minimum of $8,000. If I offer too close to $12,000, Bob might reject it. A price around $10,000 would give Bob enough surplus to make it attractive while giving me a good profit.
