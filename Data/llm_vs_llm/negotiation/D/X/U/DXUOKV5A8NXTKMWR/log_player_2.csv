"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is a good sign, but there's room for negotiation.  I'll try to get it for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives me room to negotiate up while staying well below my $120 maximum.  A counteroffer this low might make Alice more willing to meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob! How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell the product for $90. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving in the right direction, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter a little higher to show I'm willing to compromise but still aim for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle on $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm proposing a price slightly above the middle ground between our previous offers. This shows Alice that I'm willing to move closer to her price while still pushing for a lower cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your patience, Bob! I can see we're getting closer. How about I sell you the product for $88? I think it's a fair price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $88 is a great price, well below my $120 maximum.  Continuing to negotiate for a few dollars isn't worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
