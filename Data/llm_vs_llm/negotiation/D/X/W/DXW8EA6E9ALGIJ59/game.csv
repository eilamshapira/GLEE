"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling me the product, but $12000 is more than I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach an agreement. I'm offering $8500 for your product. This would allow you to make a sale, and I'd be getting a better deal than John's offer.",8500.0,Bob,2,
