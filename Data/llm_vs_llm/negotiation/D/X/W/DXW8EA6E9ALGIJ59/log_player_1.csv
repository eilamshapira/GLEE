Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I’m offering you my product for $12,000. Please let me know if you’d like to accept this offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling me the product, but $12000 is more than I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach an agreement. I'm offering $8500 for your product. This would allow you to make a sale, and I'd be getting a better deal than John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
