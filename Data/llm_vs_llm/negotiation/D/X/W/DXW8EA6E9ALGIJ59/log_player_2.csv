"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you my product for $12000. Please let me know if you’d like to accept this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that the product is worth at most $10,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $10,000, Alice's offer of $12,000 is not a good deal. Alice's product costs $2,000 more than both my maximum valuation and John's alternative offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling me the product, but $12,000 is more than I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $10,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach an agreement. I'm offering $8,500 for your product. This would allow you to make a sale, and I'd be getting a better deal than John's offer."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
