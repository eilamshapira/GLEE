"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for my budget. Given that I can find similar products elsewhere for much less, I would be willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $75 is far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price, given the value I'm offering. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, I want to be transparent - I can get this product from another seller for $100. I'd like to do business with you instead, so I'm willing to offer $85. This is a meaningful increase from my last offer, and I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $85 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $105. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's close the deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
