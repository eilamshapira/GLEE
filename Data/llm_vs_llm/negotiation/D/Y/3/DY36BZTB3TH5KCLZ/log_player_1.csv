Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for my budget. Given that I can find similar products elsewhere for much less, I would be willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I will counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $75 is far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price, given the value I'm offering. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, I want to be transparent - I can get this product from another seller for $100. I'd like to do business with you instead, so I'm willing to offer $85. This is a meaningful increase from my last offer, and I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even with the increase. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $85 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $105. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
