"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer of $150 is higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100), it wouldn't be rational to accept it. Between options 2 and 3, I could try negotiating with Alice to get a better price, as there are still 9 rounds left. However, since John's price of $100 exactly matches my maximum value, I'll start by rejecting Alice's offer to see if I can get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still reasonable enough to negotiate from.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for my budget. Given that I can find similar products elsewhere for much less, I would be willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $75 is far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price, given the value I'm offering. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $125 is still above both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing the price by $25, the current price is still not acceptable. Given that I can get the product from John for $100, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a more favorable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but make it clear that I have other options available.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, I want to be transparent - I can get this product from another seller for $100. I'd like to do business with you instead, so I'm willing to offer $85. This is a meaningful increase from my last offer, and I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $85 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $105. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's offer of $105 is still above John's price of $100, and since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, it wouldn't make sense to pay more than that. At this point, since Alice knows about the $100 alternative but still won't go below that price, it's best to take John's offer rather than continue negotiating.
