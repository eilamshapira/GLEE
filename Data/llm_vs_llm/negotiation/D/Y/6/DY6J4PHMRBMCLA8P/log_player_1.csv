Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer of $60 is far too low - it's even below my minimum acceptable value of $120. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, there's no reason to accept such a low offer. However, I'll reject and make a counteroffer rather than immediately selling to John, as there's still potential to get a better price from Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer, but still maintain a price well above my minimum value.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob has only increased his offer by $10 (from $60 to $70), which is still far below my minimum acceptable value of $120. At this point, Bob's small increment suggests he might not be willing to reach a price that would be profitable for me. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $120, and Bob seems unwilling to approach a reasonable price, it's best to end the negotiation and take the sure deal.
