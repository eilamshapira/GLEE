Send your offer to Bob.,"After analyzing the situation:
- I need at least $1,500,000 for the product
- Bob values it at $1,200,000
- I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000

Since Bob values the product less than my minimum acceptable price, and I have a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price, there's no reason to offer Bob a lower price. I'll offer at my minimum price:

{""product_price"": 1500000}"
