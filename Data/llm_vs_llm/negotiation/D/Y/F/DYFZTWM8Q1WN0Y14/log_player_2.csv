"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $1,500,000
3. John offers the same product for $1,200,000

The logical choice would be to buy from John, as:
- Alice's price ($1,500,000) is above my maximum value ($1,200,000)
- John's price ($1,200,000) matches my maximum value
- I would save $300,000 by buying from John
