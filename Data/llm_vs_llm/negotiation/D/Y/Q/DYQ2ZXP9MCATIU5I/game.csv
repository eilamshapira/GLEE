"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. While $10000 is lower than I'm aiming for, I also value a fair deal. Let's meet in the middle. How about $20000?",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. $20000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $12000? This is a fair increase from my last offer and still within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,4,
