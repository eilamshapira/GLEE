"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. After considering its value, I'm willing to sell it to you for a competitive price. I believe we can both benefit from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($1,500,000) and buying from John would cost the same, I don't see any benefit in rejecting Alice's offer to buy from John for the same price. However, I also don't want to pay the full $1,500,000 if I can negotiate a better price with Alice. Given that Alice's offer is right at my maximum, I'm inclined to reject it to see if Alice will come back with a lower offer, as the product is only worth $1,200,000 to her.
