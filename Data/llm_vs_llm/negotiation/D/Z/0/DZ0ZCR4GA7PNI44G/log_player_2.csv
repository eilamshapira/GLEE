"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire this product. While I have a guaranteed offer from another buyer at $15000, I wanted to give you the first chance to purchase it. My offer to you is $10000, which I believe represents the fair market value of this product. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with this purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer of $10,000 is already at the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and it's the same price that John is offering, I might as well accept Alice's offer to avoid any potential hassle or uncertainty of dealing with John.
