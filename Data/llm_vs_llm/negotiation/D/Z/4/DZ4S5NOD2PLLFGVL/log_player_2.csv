Alice's offer is way above my budget. I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm offering $6,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from her initial offer, but still within a range I'm willing to pay."

Alice's counteroffer is still too high. I'm willing to go a little higher than my initial counteroffer, but $18,000 is still outside my comfort zone."

I'm increasing my offer to $7,500. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my budget."

Alice is still unwilling to come down to a price I'm comfortable with. I've already made a significant counteroffer and it seems like we're stuck. Rather than continue this back and forth, I'll buy the product from John for $8,000.  It's within my budget and I'm not confident I can get Alice to go any lower."
