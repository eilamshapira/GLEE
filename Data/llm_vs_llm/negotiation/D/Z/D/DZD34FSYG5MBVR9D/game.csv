"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the product's value, but I'm looking to make a more budget-conscious purchase. I'd like to offer you $500000 to start the negotiation. Let's work towards a mutually agreeable price.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $500000 is significantly below the product's market value and my minimum acceptable price. I understand budget considerations, but I need to ensure I receive fair value. I can reduce my initial offer to $1600000, which represents a $200000 reduction. This product has exceptional quality and features that justify this price point. I'm willing to negotiate further, but we need to move closer to a range that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you, Alice, for considering a reduction. I still need to ensure this fits within my budget constraints. How about we find a middle ground at $700000? I believe this can be a fair outcome for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you moving up in your offer, which shows your genuine interest. However, $700000 is still substantially below the product's fair market value. I should mention that I have another interested buyer, John, who is prepared to pay $1200000. Given that context, I'm willing to offer you the product at $1350000, which gives you a significant advantage over the alternative buyer. This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. I hope we can find a price point that works for both of us while recognizing the true value of this product.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
