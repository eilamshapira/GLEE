Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a reasonable price to offer Bob for the product. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price if Bob rejects my offer.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I should set a price that's high enough to give me a good profit but not so high that Bob is likely to reject it outright. If the product has special features or benefits, it could be worth significantly more than my minimum acceptable price.

I'll set a price that gives me a meaningful premium over my fallback option:

{""product_price"": 22,500}"
