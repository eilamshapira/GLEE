"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The choice is clear here. Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and John is offering it at exactly $800,000, while Alice's offer is significantly higher at $2,000,000, the best decision is to buy from John. This saves me $1,200,000 compared to Alice's offer and matches my maximum valuation of the product."
