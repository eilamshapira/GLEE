"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1500000 is a bit higher than I was expecting. Would you consider $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1500000 might be a bit steep, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's discuss $1400000 as a potential sale price.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $1400000 is still a little too high for me. My maximum is $1350000. Would you consider that?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was expecting a bit more flexibility considering the product's value to you. I can offer $1375000, which is a compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",1375000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm really pushing my budget. How about $1360000? That's my final offer.",1360000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short of what I'm looking for. Considering this is your final offer, I'll meet you in the middle of your stated final offer and my last counteroffer. I can do $1368000. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",1368000.0,Alice,7,
