"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for both of us. I'm looking to get a fair price for it, considering its value and rarity."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1500000 is a bit higher than I was expecting. Would you consider $1300000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to the product's value to Bob, which is $1,500,000. Rejecting Bob's offer and selling to John for $1,200,000 would mean leaving too much value on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,500,000 might be a bit steep, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's discuss $1,400,000 as a potential sale price."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $1400000 is still a little too high for me. My maximum is $1350000. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is closer, but still not his stated maximum of $1,500,000. I'll make another counteroffer to try to get closer to a mutually beneficial price, but still aiming to maximize my earnings. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is still not the best option at this point. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was expecting a bit more flexibility considering the product's value to you. I can offer $1,375,000, which is a compromise. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1375000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm really pushing my budget. How about $1360000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's stated offer of $1,360,000 is not what he mentioned in his message, which is $1,360,000, but he said ""How about $1360000?"". I will assume he meant $1,360,000 is not his real offer and $1,360,000 is a typo, and he is offering $1,360,000 but said ""How about $1360000?"". However, I will assume he is offering $1,360,000. 

However, since Bob said that $1360000 is his final offer, but his offer is $1,360,000, I will make a counteroffer to try to get closer to a mutually beneficial price. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short of what I'm looking for. Considering this is your final offer, I'll meet you in the middle of your stated final offer and my last counteroffer. I can do $1,368,000. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1368000}"
