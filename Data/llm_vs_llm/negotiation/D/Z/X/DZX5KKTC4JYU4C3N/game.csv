"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $4000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $4000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $20000. This is a very competitive price for what it offers.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $20000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $6000, which is a significant stretch for me. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. While $6000 is still too low, I'm willing to lower the price further to $17000. This is a substantial discount and a firm offer.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $17000 is still significantly above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $7500, which is the highest I'm comfortable paying. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to consider other options.",7500.0,Bob,6,
