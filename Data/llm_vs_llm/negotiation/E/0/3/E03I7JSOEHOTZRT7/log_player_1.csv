"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I need to consider my options carefully. The product is worth at least $120 to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $120 at any time. Bob values the product at $100, which means he won't pay more than that amount. Given this situation, I should make an initial offer and see if we can negotiate a deal, but I always have my fallback option with John.
