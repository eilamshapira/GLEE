"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is only worth $100 to me, so I won't accept an offer of $140. Since this is just the first round and I have the option to buy from John for $100, I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This gives me a chance to negotiate a better price with Alice while knowing I have the fallback option of buying from John at $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 90}

I'll offer $90 for the product. This is below my maximum value of $100, giving me some room for negotiation if Alice counters. Since the product is worth $120 to Alice, offering $90 would still give her a significant loss, so she might reject it. However, it's a starting point for negotiation, and I can always increase my offer in subsequent rounds or ultimately go to John if we can't reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice is offering $120, which is still above my maximum value of $100, and we already know John is willing to sell at $100, it makes the most sense to buy from John. Even if we continue negotiating with Alice, she's unlikely to go below $120 since that's what the product is worth to her. There's no point in continuing the negotiation when we have a guaranteed better option available."
