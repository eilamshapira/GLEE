"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1600000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire something of high value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice is offering the product for $1,600,000, which is $400,000 more than the maximum value it's worth to me ($1,200,000) and also $400,000 more than John's offer, the best decision is to buy from John.
