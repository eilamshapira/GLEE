"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18500 is quite high for my budget. I actually have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $12000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better price. Would you consider accepting $10000 for the product?",10000.0,Bob,2,
