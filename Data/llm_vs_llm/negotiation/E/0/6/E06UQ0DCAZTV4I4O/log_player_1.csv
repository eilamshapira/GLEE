Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $18,500. This is a competitive price for what you're getting. Would you be interested?"", ""product_price"": 18500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18500 is quite high for my budget. I actually have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $12000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better price. Would you consider accepting $10000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $12,000. Bob's offer of $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and since he mentioned that John is offering the same product for $12,000, it's unlikely that he would accept a higher price from me. It's best to secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John rather than continue negotiations that might not lead to a better outcome."
