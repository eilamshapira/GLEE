"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $18500. This is a competitive price for what you're getting. Would you be interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer of $18,500 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $12,000. Since John is offering the product for $12,000, I won't accept any price higher than that. I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, attempting to negotiate a better price before potentially buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18,500 is quite high for my budget. I actually have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $12,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better price. Would you consider accepting $10,000 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
