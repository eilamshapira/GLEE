Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that:
1. The product is worth $12,000 to me (my minimum acceptable price)
2. The product is worth $10,000 to Bob
3. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $12,000

I know that Bob won't accept any offer above $10,000 since that's what the product is worth to him. Since I can get $12,000 from John, there's actually no price that would work for both Bob and me. I could make an offer to Bob just to see his reaction, but ultimately I should sell to John.

However, I'll start with an offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 13000}"
