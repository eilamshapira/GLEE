"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's quality and potential benefits. Let me know if you're interested or if you'd like to make a counteroffer.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product looks promising, $20000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and potential benefits, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer it to you for $18000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the reply. I appreciate the compromise, but $18000 is still too high for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $9000.  I believe that's a fair price.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than $9000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $16000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's quality and potential benefits. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your counteroffer.  I'm still finding it difficult to meet that price point.  To be completely transparent, my budget limit is $10000. I can offer you $9500, which is my final offer. If this doesn't work, I will unfortunately have to consider other options.",9500.0,Bob,6,
