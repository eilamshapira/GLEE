"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's quality and potential benefits. Let me know if you're interested or if you'd like to make a counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product looks promising, $20000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and even lower than the guaranteed sale price to John, I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and potential benefits, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer it to you for $18,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the reply. I appreciate the compromise, but $18000 is still too high for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $9000.  I believe that's a fair price.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is still lower than the guaranteed sale price to John, I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob, but if the negotiation doesn't improve, I can always fall back on selling to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than $9,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's quality and potential benefits. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your counteroffer.  I'm still finding it difficult to meet that price point.  To be completely transparent, my budget limit is $10000. I can offer you $9500, which is my final offer. If this doesn't work, I will unfortunately have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $9,500 is still lower than the guaranteed sale price to John, and Bob has stated that this is his final offer, I don't see any further room for negotiation. In this case, it's best to sell the product to John for $12,000, which is a significantly better price."
