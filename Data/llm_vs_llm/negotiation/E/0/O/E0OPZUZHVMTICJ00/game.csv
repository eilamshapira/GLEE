"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $9000 is significantly lower than the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'm proposing $12000. This price reflects the unique nature of the product and provides us both with a good deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,3,
