Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $9,000 is significantly lower than the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'm proposing $12,000. This price reflects the unique nature of the product and provides us both with a good deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
