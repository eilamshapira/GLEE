Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $9000 is significantly lower than the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'm proposing $12000. This price reflects the unique nature of the product and provides us both with a good deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
