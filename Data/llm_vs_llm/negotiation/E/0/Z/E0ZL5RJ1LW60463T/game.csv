"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13000, considering the product's value and its potential benefits to you. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to meet somewhere closer to my initial offer.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I was thinking we could do a bit better than that. How about we meet at $12500? That way, we're both making a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
