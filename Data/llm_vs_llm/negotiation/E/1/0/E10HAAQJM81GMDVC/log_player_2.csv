"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer of $14,500 is very close to John's price of $15,000, and knowing the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, I'll make a significantly lower counteroffer to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": $9,500}

The counteroffer of $9,500 is a reasonable starting point as it:
1. Gives Alice a modest profit above her $8,000 cost
2. Leaves plenty of room for negotiation
3. Would represent significant savings compared to both Alice's initial offer and John's price"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The negotiation is moving in the right direction, as Alice has reduced her price significantly from $14,500 to $12,000. This shows she has substantial room to negotiate. Since her cost is $8,000, I'll continue negotiating to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down from $14,500 to $12,000, showing willingness to negotiate, and I moved up from $9,500, I'll continue meeting in the middle but still try to get a good deal.

{""product_price"": $10,500}

This counteroffer:
1. Shows movement from my previous offer of $9,500
2. Still gives Alice a decent profit ($2,500 above her cost)
3. Maintains room for further negotiation
4. Would represent significant savings compared to both Alice's current offer and John's price"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has moved up slightly from her previous offer of $12,000 to $12,500, suggesting she's becoming more firm in her position. However, since we still have 5 more rounds available and there's still a significant gap between her cost ($8,000) and current offer ($12,500), I'll continue negotiating. We're still well below John's price of $15,000, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has moved up slightly to $12,500, showing she's becoming firmer, I'll make a more significant move in my counteroffer to try to reach a middle ground.

{""product_price"": $11,500}

This counteroffer:
1. Shows substantial movement from my previous offer of $10,500
2. Still gives Alice a good profit ($3,500 above her cost)
3. Is a significant reduction from her current offer of $12,500
4. Keeps us well below John's price of $15,000
5. Should demonstrate my willingness to reach a reasonable compromise"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has moved up to $13,000, continuing to increase her price. While this is still better than John's price, we still have 3 rounds left and room to negotiate. However, I'll need to make a more substantial move in my next counteroffer as we're running out of rounds and need to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that we only have a few rounds left and Alice has been gradually increasing her price, I need to make a more substantial move to try to close the deal.

{""product_price"": $12,000}

This counteroffer:
1. Shows significant movement from my previous offer of $11,500
2. Returns to Alice's earlier offer level, which might appeal to her
3. Still gives Alice a substantial profit ($4,000 above her cost)
4. Maintains a good savings compared to John's price
5. Shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement as time runs short"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $13,500 because:
1. We only have one round left after this
2. The price is still $1,500 less than John's price of $15,000
3. Based on the negotiation pattern, Alice is likely to increase her price further in the final round
4. There's a risk of losing the deal if we push too hard in the final rounds
5. The price, while not ideal, still represents meaningful savings compared to our alternative option"
