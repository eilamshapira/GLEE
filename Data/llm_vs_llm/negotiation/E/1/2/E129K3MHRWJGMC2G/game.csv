"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $18000. This is a competitive price for the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $10000 is too low for this product's value. Looking at your budget concerns, I can reduce the price to $15000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price better reflects the product's true value while taking your budget into consideration. Would this work for you?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $12000?  It's a fair price considering your initial offer and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,4,
