Send your offer to Bob.,"{
    ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price for the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer because:
1. Bob's offer of $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000
2. Since Bob is showing interest and engaging in negotiation, there's potential to reach a better price than John's $12,000
3. I still have John's offer as a backup if negotiations with Bob don't work out

I'd like to make a new counteroffer to Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{
    ""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $10,000 is too low for this product's value. Looking at your budget concerns, I can reduce the price to $15,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price better reflects the product's true value while taking your budget into consideration. Would this work for you?"",
    ""product_price"": 15000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $12000?  It's a fair price considering your initial offer and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer because:
1. Bob has offered $12,000, which matches John's guaranteed offer
2. Continuing negotiations might risk losing both buyers, and there's no guarantee of getting a better price
3. The offer meets my minimum acceptable price of $12,000
4. We've reached a fair compromise that works for both parties"
