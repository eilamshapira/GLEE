"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $10000 is too low for this product's value. Looking at your budget concerns, I can reduce the price to $15000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price better reflects the product's true value while taking your budget into consideration. Would this work for you?
