"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $25000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The offer from Alice at $25,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000. It's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $8,000. There's no reason to accept this offer or even continue negotiating when I have a sure option at my maximum acceptable price.
