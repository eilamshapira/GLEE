"Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well. I'm offering you a product that I understand has a value of $1000000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000, which would give you an immediate $50000 in value. This is a premium product, and I'm offering it to you first because I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe I can only go as high as $900000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900000 is a step in the right direction, I'm not able to go that low considering the product's value. I can come down to $925000, which still provides you with $75000 in immediate value. This is a fair price that works for both of us. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I can only offer $910000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget. Please let me know if that works for you.",910000.0,Bob,4,
