(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. Considering her initial offer was $1,200,000, I'll start by offering a lower price to see if we can meet in the middle or if she's willing to come down.

However, I still believe there's room for a better price. Since $1,050,000 is still below my maximum budget of $1,500,000, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, trying to meet somewhere in between my previous offer and Alice's new offer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's latest offer of $1,050,000 and my previous offer of $900,000, I'll try to find a middle ground that's still favorable to me. I'll increase my offer slightly, hoping to encourage Alice to meet me closer to this price or to consider the negotiation is getting closer to a mutually beneficial point.

Alice's offer:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has now offered $1,000,000, which is a significant reduction from her initial offer of $1,200,000. This price is still below my maximum budget of $1,500,000. Considering the back-and-forth negotiations, I believe $1,000,000 is a reasonable price for the product, especially since Alice has made an effort to meet me halfway. At this point, continuing to negotiate might not yield a substantially better price, and the risk of losing the deal or annoying Alice increases. Therefore, I'm willing to accept Alice's offer of $1,000,000.
