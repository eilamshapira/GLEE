"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product sounds interesting, $2000000 is above my budget. Would you consider $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $900000 is below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $1800000. What do you say?",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value this product can bring is significant. How about we meet at $1600000? This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $1600000 is still too high for me. I am willing to offer $1100000.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is still below what I can accept. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1400000? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product well.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're getting closer, but we need to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to lower my offer further to $1300000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
