Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to think strategically about this offer. 

If I offer Bob a price of exactly $15,000, he should be indifferent between accepting and rejecting since the product is worth exactly $15,000 to him. However, people sometimes reject offers that leave them with no surplus.

If I offer any price above $15,000, Bob will surely reject it since the product is only worth $15,000 to him.

If I offer any price below $15,000, Bob would accept, but I'd be leaving money on the table since I could get $15,000 from John.

Since I have the guaranteed fallback option of selling to John for $15,000, and the product is worth no less than $15,000 to me, the optimal strategy is to offer Bob exactly $15,000.
