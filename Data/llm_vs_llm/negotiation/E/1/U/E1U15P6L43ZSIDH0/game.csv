"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see a strong return on it.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. The product sounds interesting, but $15000 is a bit too high for me. Considering my budget, I'm willing to pay $8000. Would you be open to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $8000 is below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $11500? This would allow me to still achieve a decent return on my investment, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, my upper limit is really around $10000. I'm willing to offer $9000. This is the highest I can go without exceeding my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
