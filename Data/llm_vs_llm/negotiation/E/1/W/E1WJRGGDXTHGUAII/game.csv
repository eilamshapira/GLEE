"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product but $950000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $700000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $875000?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $750000 is still quite a way off from what I had in mind.  To be completely frank, I have another offer for $800000.  I'd much rather close the deal with you, but I'm willing to accept $825000 as my final offer.  This is a fantastic deal for a product of this caliber.",825000.0,Alice,5,
