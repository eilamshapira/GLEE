Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product but $950000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

It's time to walk away. Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $775,000 offer. Accepting would mean leaving a significant amount of money on the table.  Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees a solid profit and avoids further negotiation."
