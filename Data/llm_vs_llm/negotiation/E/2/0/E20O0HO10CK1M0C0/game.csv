"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product. While its market value is higher, I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. This is a fair price as I've already received confirmation from another buyer, John, who has agreed to purchase it at this price. However, I wanted to give you the first opportunity. Would you like to proceed with this purchase?",100.0,Alice,1,
