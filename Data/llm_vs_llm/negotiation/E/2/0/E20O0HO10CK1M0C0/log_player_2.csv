"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product. While its market value is higher, I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. This is a fair price as I've already received confirmation from another buyer, John, who has agreed to purchase it at this price. However, I wanted to give you the first opportunity. Would you like to proceed with this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
