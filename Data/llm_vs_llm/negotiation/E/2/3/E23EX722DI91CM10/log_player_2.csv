"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
2. Alice's offer is $150
3. John is offering the same product for $100

Since Alice's offer ($150) is higher than both:
- The product's worth to me ($100)
- John's alternative offer ($100)

It would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. The best option is to buy from John for $100.
