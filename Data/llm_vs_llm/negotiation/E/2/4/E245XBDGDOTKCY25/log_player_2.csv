"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at $15000. This product has exceptional quality and features that make it worth this investment. I'm open to discussing the price, but I want to be transparent that I have another interested buyer, John, who is willing to pay $10000. I'd prefer to sell it to you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
