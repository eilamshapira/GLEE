"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest and substantial proposal. While $1750000 is a considerable amount, given the product's exceptional value and potential returns, I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price to $2100000. This represents a significant reduction from my original offer while still reflecting the product's true worth. Would you consider this adjusted price?",2100000.0,Alice,3,
