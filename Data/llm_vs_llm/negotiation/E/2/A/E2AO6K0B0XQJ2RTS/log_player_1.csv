"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,500,000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential value. Would you be interested in making this investment?"", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $2500000 is significantly above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1750000. This price reflects a fair compromise considering the product's potential and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $1,750,000 is better than John's offer, but I believe there's still room for negotiation since Bob's first counteroffer is already quite substantial. This suggests he might value the product highly and could be willing to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest and substantial proposal. While $1,750,000 is a considerable amount, given the product's exceptional value and potential returns, I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price to $2,100,000. This represents a significant reduction from my original offer while still reflecting the product's true worth. Would you consider this adjusted price?"", ""product_price"": 2100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2100000 is still higher than my initial budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1900000. This price reflects a fair compromise while staying within my financial limitations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,900,000. This is a good price that represents a significant premium over John's standing offer of $1,000,000. Bob has shown good faith by increasing his offer, and given we're already in round 4, continuing to negotiate might risk losing this favorable deal. The price represents a reasonable compromise between our positions."
