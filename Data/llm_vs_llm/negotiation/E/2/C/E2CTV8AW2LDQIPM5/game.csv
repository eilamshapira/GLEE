"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you today. Given its quality and value, I'm pricing it at $180. This is a fair offer considering the product's features and market value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I actually have another seller, John, offering the same product for $150. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider selling it for $130? This would give me a reason to choose you over the other seller.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I can't go as low as $130, especially since I know I can sell it to John for $150. That's my absolute minimum price. That said, I'd be happy to work with you instead of John if we can reach an agreement. I can offer it to you for $160, which is still less than my initial price and gives you good value. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
