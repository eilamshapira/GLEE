"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I actually have another seller, John, offering the same product for $150. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider selling it for $130? This would give me a reason to choose you over the other seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I can't go as low as $130, especially since I know I can sell it to John for $150. That's my absolute minimum price. That said, I'd be happy to work with you instead of John if we can reach an agreement. I can offer it to you for $160, which is still less than my initial price and gives you good value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}"
