"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you today. Given its quality and value, I'm pricing it at $180. This is a fair offer considering the product's features and market value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price Alice is offering ($180) is actually higher than both my maximum valuation ($150) and John's price ($150). It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer since I can get the same product from John for $30 less. However, I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate to a better price before potentially buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I actually have another seller, John, offering the same product for $150. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider selling it for $130? This would give me a reason to choose you over the other seller."", ""product_price"": 130}

The strategy here is to:
1. Politely decline the high initial offer
2. Mention the alternative option (John's price) to establish a credible reference point
3. Make a counteroffer below John's price to leave room for negotiation
4. Show willingness to do business with Alice specifically if the price is right

This gives Alice room to counter while making it clear that I have alternatives and won't accept a price above $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I can't go as low as $130, especially since I know I can sell it to John for $150. That's my absolute minimum price. That said, I'd be happy to work with you instead of John if we can reach an agreement. I can offer it to you for $160, which is still less than my initial price and gives you good value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's new offer of $160 is still above both my maximum valuation ($150) and John's price ($150). While Alice has come down from her initial price, there's no reason to pay $10 more than John's price. Since Alice has indicated that $150 is her absolute minimum (stating she can sell to John at that price), it's unlikely she'll go below that. Therefore, the most rational decision is to buy from John at $150."
