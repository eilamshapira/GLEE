Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2400000}

I'm offering a higher price to Bob because:
1. I have a guaranteed fallback option with John at $1,200,000
2. Bob's true valuation is unknown, and he might value the product much higher
3. Even if Bob rejects, I won't lose anything since I can still sell to John
4. If Bob accepts, I'll make a significantly better profit"
