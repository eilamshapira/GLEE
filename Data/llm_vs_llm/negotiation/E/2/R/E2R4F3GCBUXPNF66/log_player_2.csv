"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I see that Alice is offering the product for $120, which is the same price as what John is offering. Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, this is the absolute maximum I'd be willing to pay. However, I should try to save money if possible.

I know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. If I accept this offer, I won't save any money compared to buying from John. It makes sense to try negotiating for a better price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has reduced her price to $110, which is $10 less than John's price. This is definitely moving in the right direction, but since I know the product costs Alice only $80, there's still room for negotiation to get a better deal. The $110 offer is better than John's $120, but I should try once more to get a better price.
