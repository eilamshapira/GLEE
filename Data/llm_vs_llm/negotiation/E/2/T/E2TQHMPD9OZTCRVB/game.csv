"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I understand the value you see in the product, my budget constraints limit me to a price of $200000. I'm hopeful that we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",200000.0,Bob,2,
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $200000 won't work for this product. I'll send you a new offer in the next round that better reflects its true value.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
