"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'm looking for $140, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for a maximum of $150 from John, so you're hoping to negotiate a better price with Alice."
