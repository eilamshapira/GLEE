Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer to Bob. The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, which is his maximum valuation. It's also worth at least $12,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at exactly $12,000.

Given these circumstances, there's no advantage for me to offer Bob a price below $12,000, since I can secure that amount from John. However, Bob might be willing to pay slightly above $12,000 to secure the product.

I'll offer Bob a slightly higher price than my guaranteed alternative:

{""product_price"": 12500}"
