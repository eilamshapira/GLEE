"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering you a great product that I believe you'll really value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $200, which is significantly above my valuation
3. John is offering the same product for $100, which matches my maximum valuation

Since Alice's offer ($200) is well above both my maximum valuation ($100) and John's alternative offer ($100), it would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. John's offer is clearly the better choice here.
