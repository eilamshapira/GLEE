"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product you're selling, but I'm working within a budget. Based on my research of similar products in the market, I'd like to counter with $10000. This would work well for my budget while still providing you with a fair price for your product.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate that. However, considering the premium quality and value of this product, I cannot go as low as $10000. I can come down to $12500, which represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of what you're getting. This is still an excellent investment given the product's features and quality.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. The product certainly seems valuable, but I need to be careful with my budget. I can meet you in the middle at $11250. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer while still giving me some budget flexibility. This would allow me to make the purchase now rather than continuing to shop around.",11250.0,Bob,4,
