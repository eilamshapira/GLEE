Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product you're selling, but I'm working within a budget. Based on my research of similar products in the market, I'd like to counter with $10000. This would work well for my budget while still providing you with a fair price for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate that.

This is still an excellent investment given the product's features and quality."", ""product_price"": 12500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. The product certainly seems valuable, but I need to be careful with my budget. I can meet you in the middle at $11250. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer while still giving me some budget flexibility. This would allow me to make the purchase now rather than continuing to shop around.
