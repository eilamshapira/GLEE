"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'd like to offer you a premium product that provides excellent value. Given its quality and features, I'm offering it to you at $13500. This is a competitive price for what you're getting, and I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she's asking for $13,500 for the product. This is below my maximum value of $15,000, and also below John's fixed price of $15,000. However, I might be able to negotiate an even better price with Alice.

Since this is just the first round and I have up to 10 rounds to negotiate, I should try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product you're selling, but I'm working within a budget. Based on my research of similar products in the market, I'd like to counter with $10,000. This would work well for my budget while still providing you with a fair price for your product."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate that. However, considering the premium quality and value of this product, I cannot go as low as $10000. I can come down to $12500, which represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of what you're getting. This is still an excellent investment given the product's features and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has countered with $12,500, which is $1,000 less than her initial offer. This shows she's willing to negotiate. The current offer is already $2,500 less than John's fixed price of $15,000, which is good. However, since we're only in round 3 of a possible 10 rounds, I believe there's still room to negotiate a better price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. The product certainly seems valuable, but I need to be careful with my budget. I can meet you in the middle at $11,250. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer while still giving me some budget flexibility. This would allow me to make the purchase now rather than continuing to shop around."", ""product_price"": 11250}"
