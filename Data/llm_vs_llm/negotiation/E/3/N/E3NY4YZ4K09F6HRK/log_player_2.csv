"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price offered by Alice ($150) is higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Even if negotiations with Alice fail, I can always buy from John at $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 80}

I'll offer $80, which is below John's price of $100. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to buying from John. If Alice rejects this offer, we can still negotiate further or ultimately go with John's option at $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $120 is still higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). There's no reason to accept this offer when I can either continue negotiating with Alice or buy from John for $100. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 85}

I'll increase my offer slightly to $85, showing some willingness to negotiate while still staying well below John's price of $100. This gives Alice room to make a profit while potentially getting me a better deal than John's $100 offer. If Alice rejects this, we still have several rounds to negotiate or the option to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $110 is still higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). While Alice is coming down in price, there's still no reason to accept this offer when I can get it for $100 from John. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, as we still have several rounds remaining to potentially get a better deal than John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 90}

I'll increase my offer to $90, which is still below John's price but shows continued willingness to negotiate. This gives Alice a better offer while still potentially saving me $10 compared to John's price. If Alice rejects this, we still have a few more rounds to negotiate, or we can fall back on John's $100 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's best to buy from John. Alice's offer of $105 is still above John's price of $100, and after several rounds of negotiation, Alice seems unwilling to go below John's price. Since John's price of $100 is already at my maximum value, and Alice hasn't shown willingness to beat this price, it's most rational to take John's guaranteed offer rather than continue negotiating."
