"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that I know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob and $15,000 to me, I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum acceptable price.

{""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and is even below his own valuation of $12,000, I will reject this offer. However, since I have the guaranteed option to sell to John for $15,000, and Bob's initial offer is so low, it might be more efficient to sell to John now rather than continue negotiating.
