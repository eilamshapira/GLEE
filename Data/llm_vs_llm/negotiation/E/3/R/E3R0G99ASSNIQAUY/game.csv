"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $12000. I believe it's a fair price, considering the product's quality and potential benefits. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product sounds interesting, but $12000 is a bit too high for me right now. Considering I can get a similar product for $10000, I'm willing to offer $8000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I have to consider the product's value to me. While I appreciate your offer of $8000, I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer you a discount from the original price, but I think a more reasonable price would be $10500. This way, you'll still be getting a great product at a lower price than my initial offer, and I'll be able to meet you halfway.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks Alice. I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not comfortable going above $9000. How about $9000?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. I can see that we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. While $9000 is a reasonable offer, I'm still a bit above that in terms of my target price. I'm willing to make another concession, though. How about we meet at $10000? This way, you'll be getting an excellent product at a price that's still lower than my original offer, and I'll be able to feel confident that I've gotten a fair deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
