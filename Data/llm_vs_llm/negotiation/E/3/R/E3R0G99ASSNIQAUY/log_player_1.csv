Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $12,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product sounds interesting, but $12000 is a bit too high for me right now. Considering I can get a similar product for $10000, I'm willing to offer $8000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I have to consider the product's value to me. While I appreciate your offer of $8,000, I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer you a discount from the original price, but I think a more reasonable price would be $10,500. This way, you'll still be getting a great product at a lower price than my initial offer, and I'll be able to meet you halfway."", ""product_price"": 10500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice. I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not comfortable going above $9000. How about $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. I can see that we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. While $9,000 is a reasonable offer, I'm still a bit above that in terms of my target price. I'm willing to make another concession, though. How about we meet at $10,000? This way, you'll be getting an excellent product at a price that's still lower than my original offer, and I'll be able to feel confident that I've gotten a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
