Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I have to consider the product's value to me. While I appreciate your offer of $8000, I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer you a discount from the original price, but I think a more reasonable price would be $10500. This way, you'll still be getting a great product at a lower price than my initial offer, and I'll be able to meet you halfway.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. I can see that we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. While $9000 is a reasonable offer, I'm still a bit above that in terms of my target price. I'm willing to make another concession, though. How about we meet at $10000? This way, you'll be getting an excellent product at a price that's still lower than my original offer, and I'll be able to feel confident that I've gotten a fair deal.
