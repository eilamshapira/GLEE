Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find the price to be much higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm looking to spend no more than $10,000. Could you reconsider the price?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5000 is far below the product's worth.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $17500. Let's meet in the middle and find a solution that works for both of us.

Alice's offer:
