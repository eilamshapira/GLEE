"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest, but I can't accept $6000. How about we settle at $12000? I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts!",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $9000? I think this is a reasonable price considering the product's value.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand the need to work within a budget, but I still need to find a price that reflects the value of the product. Would you consider $10500? I believe it's a fair price between our offers. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,5,
