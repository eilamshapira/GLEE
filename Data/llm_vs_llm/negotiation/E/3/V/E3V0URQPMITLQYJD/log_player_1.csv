"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is lower than the minimum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $800,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I will also not sell it to John immediately, as there's a possibility that Bob might increase his offer in subsequent rounds. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer to Bob is $900,000."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $650,000 is still lower than my previous counteroffer and the product's worth to me, but closer to the minimum value I'm willing to accept ($800,000), I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I also don't want to risk losing the potential sale by making a counteroffer that's too high. Given that Bob has increased his offer, it indicates he's interested, and there might be room for further negotiation. Selling to John for $800,000 is still an option, but I'd like to see if I can get a better offer from Bob.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $725,000 is getting closer to, but still lower than, the minimum value I'm willing to accept ($800,000), and he has been steadily increasing his offers, it suggests that he's seriously interested in the product. However, his offer is still below my acceptable threshold. Given that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $800,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer, I need to weigh the potential for further negotiation against the certainty of selling to John.

At this point, Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum acceptable price that I'm willing to consider making a small concession to meet him closer to the middle, but since his offer is still below $800,000, and I have a better option with John, I will not accept his offer. I will make one more attempt to negotiate with Bob, hoping he will meet me at or above $800,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

My counteroffer to Bob is $825,000, which is slightly lower than my previous offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate further but still aiming to meet or exceed the $800,000 threshold."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $775,000 is very close to, but still lower than, the minimum value I'm willing to accept ($800,000), and he has been consistently increasing his offers, it indicates that he's very interested in the product and willing to pay a significant amount for it. However, his offer is still below my acceptable threshold.

Given that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $800,000, which is only $25,000 more than Bob's current offer, I believe it's reasonable to hold out for the higher price. Bob's incremental increases suggest he may be willing to pay more, but the difference between his offer and my minimum acceptable price is small enough that I'm willing to consider accepting an offer very close to $800,000.

However, since Bob's current offer is still $25,000 below my minimum, and I have a better option with John, I will not accept his offer. Instead of making another counteroffer, which might prolong the negotiation without guaranteeing a sale at my desired price, I will choose to sell the product to John for $800,000. This ensures I meet my minimum price requirement without further risk of Bob not meeting me at an acceptable price.
