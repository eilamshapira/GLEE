"Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $12000. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Would you be willing to consider that?",6000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $6000 is below our minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $10000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10000 might still be a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? This is the best I can do while still maintaining the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7200. Would you be willing to consider that?",7200.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $7200 is still below our minimum acceptable price. I can go as low as $8500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",8500.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but I need to stick to a price that reflects the product's value. How about we settle at $8200? This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",8200.0,Alice,5,
