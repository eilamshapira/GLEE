Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Would you be willing to consider that?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 might still be a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This is the best I can do while still maintaining the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}"

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200.
