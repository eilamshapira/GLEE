"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its value and value it will generate for you, I'm confident that a price of $1450000 is more than reasonable for both parties. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $1,450,000 and I want to save as much money as possible, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower, but still reasonable. Considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, I'll aim for a price that is closer to that value.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value more accurately."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I'm afraid $1000000 significantly undervalues the product. Considering the benefits you'll gain, let's settle for $1375000. It's a fair middle ground that recognizes both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice rejected my previous offer and came back with a counteroffer of $1,375,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and her current offer. This would put the price at around $1,187,500. However, considering Alice's initial valuation of the product is $1,200,000, I'll make a counteroffer slightly above the midpoint to show my willingness to negotiate, but still below Alice's valuation.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still very interested in the product, but I need to balance my budget. How about we meet at $1,200,000? This price reflects the product's value to you and is a significant investment from my side."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I must insist that $1200000 is still too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1325000. This price ensures that both parties walk away feeling good about the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice rejected my previous offer of $1,200,000 and came back with a counteroffer of $1,325,000, I'll try to find a middle ground again. Alice's current offer is $1,325,000, and my previous offer was $1,200,000, so the midpoint would be $1,262,500. However, considering I want to save as much money as possible and Alice seems willing to negotiate, I'll make a counteroffer slightly below this midpoint.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I still need to be mindful of my budget. How about we settle at $1,250,000? This price is a significant compromise from my initial offer and reflects my serious interest in the product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
