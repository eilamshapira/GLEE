"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but my budget is a bit tight. I can offer $100 for it. Let me know if we can work something out! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120, I will not accept it. Additionally, selling to John for $120 is an option, but I believe the product is worth more, so I'd like to try to negotiate further with Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that budget can be a constraint, but I still believe the product is worth more than $100.
