Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my offer to Bob. If I offer a price that's too high, Bob might reject it, and I'll end up selling to John for $100. If I offer a price that's too low, I might not maximize my profit.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll set a price that gives me a reasonable chance of making more than my guaranteed $100 from John, while not being so high that Bob is likely to reject it.
