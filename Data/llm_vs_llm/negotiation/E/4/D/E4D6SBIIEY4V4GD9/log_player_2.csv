"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer is $150, which is the same price as John's offer, and both prices equal my maximum valuation of $150, I am indifferent between the options. I might as well accept Alice's offer since it's immediately available.
