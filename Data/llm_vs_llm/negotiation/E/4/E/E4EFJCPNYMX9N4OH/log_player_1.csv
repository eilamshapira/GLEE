"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the potential value in the product, I'm looking to stay within a more manageable budget. How about we agree on $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the minimum value the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for the same price, I don't see a need to negotiate further at this point. However, considering I have multiple rounds to negotiate and the potential to earn more, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and proceed with a counteroffer, aiming to find a middle ground or a higher price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget concerns, but I believe the product's value exceeds $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer, I'd like to propose a compromise: $10,000. This price reflects the product's worth while also taking into account your interest in it."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
