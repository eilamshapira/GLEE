"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting with a competitive price, considering the product's worth to me.",3000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $3000000 is significantly above my budget and market value for this product. I'd like to make a reasonable counteroffer of $800000, which I believe better reflects the fair market value.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $3000000 might be out of your budget, but $800000 is below my acceptable range. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Considering the product's value and our discussion, I'd like to propose a price of $2200000. This price reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer while still respecting the product's worth.",2200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price significantly, Alice. However, $2200000 is still substantially above my budget. I can work with you on finding a middle ground, and I'm willing to increase my previous offer. I can offer $1000000 for the product, which represents a significant increase from my last offer while staying within my budget constraints.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $1000000. It shows that we're moving in the right direction. However, I still need to consider the product's value to me. Given that I can sell it to another buyer for $1500000, I'm looking for a price that's closer to that range. I'm willing to make a concession and offer the product for $1400000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's worth.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for sharing that information, Alice, and for your continued flexibility in negotiations. I understand you have another offer at $1500000, and I appreciate you being willing to go lower. However, I need to stay within my budget constraints. I can offer $1150000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and very close to the maximum I can spend on this product.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your latest offer of $1150000, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, as you know, I have another offer on the table for $1500000. Considering your budget constraints and my need to prioritize the best offer, I'm willing to make a small concession. I can offer the product for $1375000. This is a compromise that takes into account your latest offer and my alternative option. If you're able to meet me at this price, I believe we can finalize the deal.",1375000.0,Alice,7,
