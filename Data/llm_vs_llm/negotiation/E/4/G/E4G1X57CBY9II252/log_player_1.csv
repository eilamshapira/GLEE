"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $3000000 is significantly above my budget and market value for this product. I'd like to make a reasonable counteroffer of $800000, which I believe better reflects the fair market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $800,000 because it's significantly lower than the value I place on the product. Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'll try to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can meet at a more satisfactory price for both of us."

This price reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer while still respecting the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 2200000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I can offer $1000000 for the product, which represents a significant increase from my last offer while staying within my budget constraints.

Round 5

I'm willing to make a concession and offer the product for $1,400,000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for sharing that information, Alice, and for your continued flexibility in negotiations. I understand you have another offer at $1500000, and I appreciate you being willing to go lower. However, I need to stay within my budget constraints.

I reject Bob's offer of $1,150,000. Although he's getting closer to my target price and has increased his offer significantly, it's still below the $1,500,000 I can get from John. Since Bob has mentioned that $1,150,000 is very close to his maximum budget, I'll try to negotiate a bit further to see if he can stretch his budget or if I can find a compromise that works for both of us."
