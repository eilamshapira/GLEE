Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a somewhat high offer to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $7,000 since it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 (and even below John's guaranteed offer). Since I can always sell to John for $8,000, there's no reason to accept anything lower.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a new counteroffer: {""product_price"": 8,800}"
