"Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer ($160) is higher than both my maximum valuation ($150) and John's price ($150), it makes no sense to accept Alice's offer. 

Between options 2 and 3, since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum valuation ($150), and it's less than Alice's offer, I should buy from John.
