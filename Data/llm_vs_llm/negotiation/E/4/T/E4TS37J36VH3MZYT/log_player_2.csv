"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'm evaluating Alice's offer of $1,500,000 against my alternatives.

In this case, Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000, which is exactly the same price that John is offering ($1,500,000). The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me.

Since both offers are identical in price, and equal to my maximum valuation, I'm indifferent between accepting Alice's offer or buying from John.
