"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than my maximum budget of $1,200,000, and it's a significant savings, I will choose to accept Alice's offer.
