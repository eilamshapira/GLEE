"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's something you value at $150, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $175. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering to sell you a product for $175. However, the product is only worth $150 to you, and John is willing to sell you the same product for $150.

Since you want to save as much money as possible while buying the product, and the product is worth no more than $150 to you, it would not make sense to pay $175 for it.
