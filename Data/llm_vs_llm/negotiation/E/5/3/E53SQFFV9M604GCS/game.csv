"Alice, I appreciate the value and uniqueness of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. Considering my budget and the potential benefits, I'd like to offer $1200000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on budget, but $1200000 is lower than I'm willing to go at this stage. This product holds immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $1600000.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1600000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I'd like to propose $1400000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in price. It shows you recognize the value. I am getting closer to a point where I have another guaranteed buyer, but I still want you to have the opportunity. I can come down a bit more to $1550000, but that's as low as I can realistically go at this point. It's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I truly believe it's a worthwhile investment for you.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
