{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and within my budget. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a lower price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $90. Let me know if that works for you!"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. However, $90 is too low for me. I can offer you the product for $125. Let me know if that works better for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $125 is still above my budget of $100. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $100, I don't see a need to accept Alice's offer. I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to meet Alice halfway between my previous offer and her new offer. Since she offered $125 and I previously offered $90, I'll increase my offer to $97.50, which is still within my budget of $100.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $125 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $97.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider!"", ""product_price"": 97.50}"
