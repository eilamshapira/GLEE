"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be perfect for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $12500. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $8,000
2. Alice is offering the product for $12,500
3. John is offering a guaranteed price of $8,000

Since Alice's offer ($12,500) is significantly higher than both:
- My maximum value ($8,000)
- John's alternative offer ($8,000)

It would not be rational to accept Alice's offer as it would mean paying $4,500 more than the product is worth to me. John's offer matches my maximum value, and while it's not a bargain, it's the better option available.
