"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the quality of the product, but $250 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in buying, but I'd only be able to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $80 is unfortunately too low for this product given its quality and value. I understand $250 might be high for you, but I could offer it for $200. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and reflects the true value of the product.",200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. $200 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $140. Let me know if you're interested in that price.",140.0,Bob,4,
