Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it for $250. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the quality of the product, but $250 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in buying, but I'd only be able to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and even below what John is willing to pay. Let me try to negotiate for a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $80 is unfortunately too low for this product given its quality and value. I understand $250 might be high for you, but I could offer it for $200. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. $200 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $140. Let me know if you're interested in that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $150. While Bob's offer of $140 is getting closer, it's still below what John is willing to pay. Since there's no guarantee that Bob will agree to a higher price, and the difference between his offer and John's guaranteed $150 is still significant, it makes more sense to take the sure deal with John."
