Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $80 is unfortunately too low for this product given its quality and value. I understand $250 might be high for you, but I could offer it for $200. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and reflects the true value of the product.
