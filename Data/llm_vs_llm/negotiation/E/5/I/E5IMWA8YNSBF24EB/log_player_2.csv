"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and John is offering it for exactly $100, it doesn't make sense to accept Alice's offer of $200, which is twice as much.

I could try to negotiate with Alice by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer, but since I already have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $100 (which is the maximum amount I value the product at), the rational decision is to simply buy from John.
