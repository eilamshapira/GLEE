"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand budget considerations are important, but I need to be fair about the product's value. After reviewing your offer, I can come down to $1350000, which is a $50000 reduction from my initial offer. This represents excellent value considering the product is worth significantly more than this to your operation, while still allowing me to meet my minimum requirements.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit on the price. However, $1350000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to meet you a little closer to the middle. Would you consider $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
