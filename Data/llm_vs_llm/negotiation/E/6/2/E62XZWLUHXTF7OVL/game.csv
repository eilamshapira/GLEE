"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price of $2300000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I've done some research and considered the product's features and market value. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the product's worth to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $1000000, I'm afraid I can't accept it as it's significantly below the product's value. The product has exceptional features and market potential that justify a higher price point. I have another buyer who is willing to pay $1800000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can come down to $2000000, which I believe represents a substantial discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of the product. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $2000000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still find the price to be higher than I'm comfortable with. Given that you mentioned another buyer is willing to pay $1800000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and it's also the price at which I can buy the product from another seller, John. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider purchasing from him.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
