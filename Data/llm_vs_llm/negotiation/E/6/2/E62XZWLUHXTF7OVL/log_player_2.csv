Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $1000000, I'm afraid I can't accept it as it's significantly below the product's value. The product has exceptional features and market potential that justify a higher price point. I have another buyer who is willing to pay $1800000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can come down to $2000000, which I believe represents a substantial discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of the product. What do you think?

However, I still find the price to be higher than I'm comfortable with. Given that you mentioned another buyer is willing to pay $1,800,000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and it's also the price at which I can buy the product from another seller, John.
