"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1500000 feels quite steep for me. How about we start at $700000? Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your response. While I understand your concerns about the price, I can't go as low as $700000. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell the product for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, $1200000 is still a bit above what I had in mind. Would you consider $1000000 instead? Looking forward to your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your earlier proposal. I understand your position, but I believe $1000000 is a fair offer for us to proceed. I'm hopeful we can find common ground at this price. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
