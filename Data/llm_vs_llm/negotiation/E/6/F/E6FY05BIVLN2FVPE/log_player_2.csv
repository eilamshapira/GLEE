"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,499,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,499,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,499,999 is less than my maximum budget of $1,500,000 and also less than what I would pay if I were to buy from John, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer to save $1 compared to buying from John.
