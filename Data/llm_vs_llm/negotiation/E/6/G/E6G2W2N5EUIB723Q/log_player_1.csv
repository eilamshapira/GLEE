Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also signals that I'm not desperate to sell at his price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is better than Bob's first offer, it's still below my minimum threshold and below what I can get from John.  I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,200,000 to ensure I achieve my minimum desired price."
