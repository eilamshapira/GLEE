Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. 

I know the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000. This means I have nothing to lose by making a higher offer to Bob.

Since I don't know Bob's maximum willingness to pay, I should make a reasonably high offer that still has a chance of being accepted. If Bob rejects it, I still have my $10,000 fallback with John.

I'll set the price at $15,000, which is a 50% premium over my minimum acceptable price. This gives me significant upside potential while still being potentially acceptable to Bob.
