"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will bring great value to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to let it go for a price of $17000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $17,000, which is significantly above my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $10,000
4. Even if I make a counteroffer, Alice is unlikely to go below $15,000 since that's the product's worth to her

The logical decision is to buy from John, as his price matches my maximum value and is significantly lower than Alice's offer.
