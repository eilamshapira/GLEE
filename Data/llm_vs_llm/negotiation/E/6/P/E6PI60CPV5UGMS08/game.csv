"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, the price is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $7000 for the product. Would you consider this price?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $7000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product's value is significantly higher. I can come down from my initial offer to $8800, which I believe is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth. Would you be able to meet me at this price?",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $8800 is still a bit high for me. I can go up to $7500. Is this something you can work with?",7500.0,Bob,4,
