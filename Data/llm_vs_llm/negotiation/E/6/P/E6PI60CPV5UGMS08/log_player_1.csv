"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great fit for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, the price is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $7000 for the product. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer since Bob's offer of $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and I believe we can still negotiate to reach a better price than what John is offering. I'll continue negotiating with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $7,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product's value is significantly higher. I can come down from my initial offer to $8,800, which I believe is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth. Would you be able to meet me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 8800}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $8800 is still a bit high for me. I can go up to $7500. Is this something you can work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $8,000. Bob's offer of $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and after two rounds of negotiation, Bob's incremental increases suggest he's unlikely to reach or exceed $8,000. It's best to take John's guaranteed offer of $8,000 rather than risk more rounds of negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome."
