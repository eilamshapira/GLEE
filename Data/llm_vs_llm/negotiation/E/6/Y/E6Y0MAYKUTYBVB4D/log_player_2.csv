"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $12,000
2. Alice's offer is $10,000, which is $2,000 less than my maximum value
3. I can continue negotiating with Alice to potentially get an even better price
4. I still have 9 more rounds of negotiation available
5. I always have the option to buy from John at $12,000 as a backup

Given that Alice's first offer is already reasonably good ($2,000 below my maximum), I could accept it. However, since this is the first round and sellers often start with higher prices expecting negotiation, I might be able to get an even better deal by making a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice offered $10,000, I'll try to negotiate for a lower price. A common negotiation tactic is to start lower than what you're actually willing to pay, giving room for negotiation. Since Alice's initial offer was reasonable, I don't want to go too low and risk appearing unreasonable, but I'll aim for a significant reduction to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 8000}

This counteroffer of $8,000:
1. Is $2,000 lower than Alice's initial offer
2. Leaves room for negotiation to meet somewhere in the middle
3. Isn't so low as to appear unreasonable given Alice's initial offer
4. Could potentially save me up to $4,000 compared to John's price
5. Still gives me flexibility to increase my offer in future rounds if needed"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $10,000 to $9,500 (a $500 reduction)
2. This shows Alice is willing to negotiate and move towards a middle ground
3. $9,500 is $2,500 less than John's price
4. We still have 7 more rounds of negotiation possible
5. Alice's movement from $10,000 to $9,500 ($500 reduction) compared to my movement from $8,000 to her $9,500 ($1,500 increase) suggests there might still be room for negotiation

While $9,500 is a good price (well below my maximum of $12,000), since Alice has shown willingness to negotiate and we have several rounds left, I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet at an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has moved down $500 from her initial offer, showing some flexibility. I'll now try to meet closer to the middle between our last positions. Her last offer was $9,500, and my last offer was $8,000. I'll increase my previous offer significantly to show good faith and try to reach a deal.

{""product_price"": 8750}

This counteroffer of $8,750:
1. Is a $750 increase from my previous offer, showing significant movement
2. Splits the difference between my last offer ($8,000) and her last offer ($9,500)
3. Still saves me $3,250 compared to John's price
4. Shows I'm willing to negotiate substantially
5. Leaves some room for further negotiation if needed"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze Alice's latest offer:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $9,500 to $9,000 (another $500 reduction)
2. This is a significant movement from her initial $10,000 offer (total $1,000 reduction)
3. $9,000 is $3,000 less than John's price
4. Alice has shown consistent willingness to negotiate, moving down $500 each time
5. The gap between our last positions ($8,750 vs $9,000) is now only $250

Given that:
- The gap has narrowed significantly
- $9,000 represents a good price (25% below my maximum value)
- Alice has made consistent good-faith movements
- The potential benefit of further negotiation ($250 or less) might not be worth the risk

I will accept this offer.
