"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2000000. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm open to negotiations.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I must be honest that $2000000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1500000 to me, which is actually the price another seller named John is offering. However, I'd prefer to work with you. Would you consider $1200000 for the product? This would allow me to choose your offering instead of going with the alternative.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your honest response and for considering my offer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I must say that $1200000 is a bit lower than I had hoped for. Given the product's exceptional value, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I can offer you the product for $1600000, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, I need to be transparent that I have a firm alternative offer from John at $1500000. Since that's already my maximum budget for this product, I can't justify paying more than that. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer $1350000, which saves me some money while still giving you a fair deal. If we can't reach an agreement below $1500000, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your transparency regarding the alternative offer from John. I understand that you have a firm budget, and I appreciate your willingness to consider my offer. Given the circumstances, I'm willing to make a serious concession to meet your needs. I can offer you the product for $1450000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
