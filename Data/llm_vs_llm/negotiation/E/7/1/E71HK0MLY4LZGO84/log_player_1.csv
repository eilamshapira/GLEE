Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I must be honest that $2000000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1500000 to me, which is actually the price another seller named John is offering. However, I'd prefer to work with you. Would you consider $1200000 for the product? This would allow me to choose your offering instead of going with the alternative. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

However, I must say that $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I had hoped for. Given the product's exceptional value, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I can offer you the product for $1,600,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, I need to be transparent that I have a firm alternative offer from John at $1500000. Since that's already my maximum budget for this product, I can't justify paying more than that. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer $1350000, which saves me some money while still giving you a fair deal. If we can't reach an agreement below $1500000, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your transparency regarding the alternative offer from John. I understand that you have a firm budget, and I appreciate your willingness to consider my offer. Given the circumstances, I'm willing to make a serious concession to meet your needs. I can offer you the product for $1,450,000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1450000}"
