"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2000000. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Given that Alice's initial offer of $2,000,000 exceeds the product's worth to me ($1,500,000) and is also higher than John's fixed price ($1,500,000), I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I must be honest that $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, which is actually the price another seller named John is offering. However, I'd prefer to work with you. Would you consider $1,200,000 for the product? This would allow me to choose your offering instead of going with the alternative."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your honest response and for considering my offer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I must say that $1200000 is a bit lower than I had hoped for. Given the product's exceptional value, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I can offer you the product for $1600000, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,600,000 is still higher than John's price of $1,500,000. Since I can get the same product from John for less, and Alice's price is also above my maximum valuation, I should reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, I need to be transparent that I have a firm alternative offer from John at $1,500,000. Since that's already my maximum budget for this product, I can't justify paying more than that. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer $1,350,000, which saves me some money while still giving you a fair deal. If we can't reach an agreement below $1,500,000, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your transparency regarding the alternative offer from John. I understand that you have a firm budget, and I appreciate your willingness to consider my offer. Given the circumstances, I'm willing to make a serious concession to meet your needs. I can offer you the product for $1450000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has now offered $1,450,000, which is below John's price of $1,500,000 and within my maximum valuation. This is a good deal that saves me $50,000 compared to buying from John. I should accept this offer.
