Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value of $1,200,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,200,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I am willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer is $1,800,000.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is still significantly lower than the minimum value of $1,200,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,200,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. At this point, it seems that Bob is not willing to meet my price, and I don't want to lower my offer too much. 

My decision is: 
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
