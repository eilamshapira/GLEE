"Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1800000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a fruitful negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $1800000 is well above what I can justify for this product. The market value for similar products is considerably lower, and I have another seller offering the same product for $1000000. However, I would prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product, which allows me some savings compared to my alternative while still providing you with a fair profit. I hope we can work together on this.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the market value for a product of this caliber is significantly higher than you're suggesting.  While I understand your position, I can't accept such a drastic reduction. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This price reflects the true value of this product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on your price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - this product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I have a confirmed alternative offer at exactly that price from John. While I'd prefer to purchase from you, I can't justify paying significantly more than the product's value to me. I can offer you $900000, which is the best I can do while still giving me some savings compared to my alternative option. This represents a fair deal considering the market situation I'm facing.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your constraints, but I'm surprised to hear about John's offer.  My understanding of the market suggests a significantly higher value for this product.  To move towards a mutually agreeable outcome, I'll propose $1300000. This is my final offer, and I believe it fairly reflects the value of this unique product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for reducing your price further, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I must be direct - I cannot and will not pay more than the $1000000 maximum value this product has to me. John's offer at $1000000 is exactly at my maximum budget, and while I'd prefer to do business with you, I need a financial incentive to do so. My final offer is $950000, which is very close to my absolute maximum while still providing me a small benefit for choosing to work with you. If we can't reach an agreement at or below my maximum value, I'll regrettably need to proceed with my alternative option.",950000.0,Bob,6,
