Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $1800000 is well above what I can justify for this product. The market value for similar products is considerably lower, and I have another seller offering the same product for $1000000. However, I would prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product, which allows me some savings compared to my alternative while still providing you with a fair profit. I hope we can work together on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and while his message attempts to appear reasonable, it's clear he's aiming for a much lower price point.  There's room for negotiation, but accepting his offer now would be a mistake.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the market value for a product of this caliber is significantly higher than you're suggesting.  While I understand your position, I can't accept such a drastic reduction. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This price reflects the true value of this product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on your price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - this product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I have a confirmed alternative offer at exactly that price from John. While I'd prefer to purchase from you, I can't justify paying significantly more than the product's value to me. I can offer you $900000, which is the best I can do while still giving me some savings compared to my alternative option. This represents a fair deal considering the market situation I'm facing. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is interesting. Bob is claiming he can get the product from ""John"" for $1,000,000, which is curiously my exact fallback price. This could be a bluff, or he could be privy to information I don't have. 

While his offer is still too low, the risk of calling his bluff versus the potential reward of a higher price needs to be weighed. I'm willing to test his claim a bit further.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for reducing your price further, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I must be direct - I cannot and will not pay more than the $1000000 maximum value this product has to me. John's offer at $1000000 is exactly at my maximum budget, and while I'd prefer to do business with you, I need a financial incentive to do so. My final offer is $950000, which is very close to my absolute maximum while still providing me a small benefit for choosing to work with you. If we can't reach an agreement at or below my maximum value, I'll regrettably need to proceed with my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a critical point. Bob is sticking to his story about John's offer, and his ""final offer"" is still significantly below my minimum.  

It's very possible this is a calculated tactic to pressure me into a low sale. At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer from Bob is outweighed by the certainty of John's offer.
