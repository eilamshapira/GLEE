"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1800000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a fruitful negotiation. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering the product for $1,800,000, which is significantly above the $1,000,000 the product is worth to me. Also, I know I can purchase the same product from John for exactly $1,000,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $1,800,000 is well above what I can justify for this product. The market value for similar products is considerably lower, and I have another seller offering the same product for $1,000,000. However, I would prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, which allows me some savings compared to my alternative while still providing you with a fair profit. I hope we can work together on this."", ""product_price"": 850000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the market value for a product of this caliber is significantly higher than you're suggesting.  While I understand your position, I can't accept such a drastic reduction. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This price reflects the true value of this product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has reduced her price to $1,500,000, which is still $500,000 more than John's price of $1,000,000 and still exceeds the maximum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible while still getting the product, her current offer doesn't make financial sense.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on your price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - this product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and I have a confirmed alternative offer at exactly that price from John. While I'd prefer to purchase from you, I can't justify paying significantly more than the product's value to me. I can offer you $900,000, which is the best I can do while still giving me some savings compared to my alternative option. This represents a fair deal considering the market situation I'm facing."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints, but I'm surprised to hear about John's offer.  My understanding of the market suggests a significantly higher value for this product.  To move towards a mutually agreeable outcome, I'll propose $1300000. This is my final offer, and I believe it fairly reflects the value of this unique product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Even though she claims this is her final offer, it still doesn't make financial sense for me to accept it when I have a better alternative.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for reducing your price further, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I must be direct - I cannot and will not pay more than the $1,000,000 maximum value this product has to me. John's offer at $1,000,000 is exactly at my maximum budget, and while I'd prefer to do business with you, I need a financial incentive to do so. My final offer is $950,000, which is very close to my absolute maximum while still providing me a small benefit for choosing to work with you. If we can't reach an agreement at or below my maximum value, I'll regrettably need to proceed with my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
