"Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product to offer you today. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the product you're selling, but $180 is quite a bit above my budget. I'm looking to spend no more than $70 for this product, as I have another offer from John for $100. Would you be willing to offer a better price that would make it worthwhile for me to buy from you instead?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $70 as it's well below the market value of this product. I noticed you mentioned having an offer from John for $100, but I think there might be some confusion there. Given the quality and value of the product, I can reduce my price to $150, which I believe is a fair offer. Would you be interested in this price?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for reducing your price. However, $150 is still above what I'm willing to pay for this product. The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and John is offering it at exactly that price. To make it worthwhile for me to buy from you instead, I would need a better deal. I can offer $85 for the product. This would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you?",85.0,Bob,4,
