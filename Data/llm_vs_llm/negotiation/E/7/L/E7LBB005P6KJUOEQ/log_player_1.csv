"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product to offer you today. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the product you're selling, but $180 is quite a bit above my budget. I'm looking to spend no more than $70 for this product, as I have another offer from John for $100. Would you be willing to offer a better price that would make it worthwhile for me to buy from you instead? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. Bob's offer of $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and since I know I can get $100 from John, there's no reason to accept such a low offer. Also, Bob's statement about having another offer from John for $100 seems incorrect since I know John is actually on my side as a backup buyer. I'll continue negotiating for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $70 as it's well below the market value of this product. I noticed you mentioned having an offer from John for $100, but I think there might be some confusion there. Given the quality and value of the product, I can reduce my price to $150, which I believe is a fair offer. Would you be interested in this price?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for reducing your price. However, $150 is still above what I'm willing to pay for this product. The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and John is offering it at exactly that price. To make it worthwhile for me to buy from you instead, I would need a better deal. I can offer $85 for the product. This would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John. Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and he seems to be using incorrect information about John's offers as negotiation leverage. Since I can guarantee $100 from John, and Bob's highest offer so far is only $85 with no indication he'll go much higher, it's best to take the sure deal with John rather than continue negotiating."
