"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product to offer you today. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given the information, Alice is offering the product for $180, which is higher than the $100 maximum value to me. John is offering the same product for $100, which is exactly at my maximum value threshold.

Since Alice's initial offer is significantly above my maximum value, and John's offer is guaranteed at $100, I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. If negotiations with Alice fail, I can always fall back on John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the product you're selling, but $180 is quite a bit above my budget. I'm looking to spend no more than $70 for this product, as I have another offer from John for $100. Would you be willing to offer a better price that would make it worthwhile for me to buy from you instead?"", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $70 as it's well below the market value of this product. I noticed you mentioned having an offer from John for $100, but I think there might be some confusion there. Given the quality and value of the product, I can reduce my price to $150, which I believe is a fair offer. Would you be interested in this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has reduced her price to $150, but this is still above the $100 maximum value that the product is worth to me. Since John is offering the product for $100, which is exactly at my maximum value threshold, Alice's offer is not competitive enough.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a better deal. If we can't reach an agreement, I still have John's offer as a fallback.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for reducing your price. However, $150 is still above what I'm willing to pay for this product. The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and John is offering it at exactly that price. To make it worthwhile for me to buy from you instead, I would need a better deal. I can offer $85 for the product. This would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 85}"
