"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I must be honest that $1750000 is significantly above my budget. The market value for this product is considerably lower, and I have another seller (John) who is offering the same product for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $1300000, which I believe is a reasonable price given current market conditions.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your honest response and for sharing the market information. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must consider the product's value to me, which is significantly higher than $1300000. I understand that you have another option, but I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's uniqueness and our mutual interest in closing the deal.",1525000.0,Alice,3,
