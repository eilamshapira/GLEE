Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be a valuable addition to your collection. After careful consideration, I've set a price that I think reflects its true worth."", ""product_price"": 1,750,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I must be honest that $1750000 is significantly above my budget. The market value for this product is considerably lower, and I have another seller (John) who is offering the same product for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $1300000, which I believe is a reasonable price given current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your honest response and for sharing the market information. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must consider the product's value to me, which is significantly higher than $1,300,000. I understand that you have another option, but I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's uniqueness and our mutual interest in closing the deal."", ""product_price"": 1,525,000}"
