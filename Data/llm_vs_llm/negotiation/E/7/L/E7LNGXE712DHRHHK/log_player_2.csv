"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be a valuable addition to your collection. After careful consideration, I've set a price that I think reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to be careful here. Alice is offering the product for $1,750,000, but I know the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me. John is already offering it at $1,500,000, which is my maximum valuation.

Alice's initial offer is $250,000 above my maximum value, so accepting it would be a bad deal for me. I should either reject and make a counteroffer or buy from John directly.

Since I have the opportunity to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price than John's $1,500,000, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I must be honest that $1,750,000 is significantly above my budget. The market value for this product is considerably lower, and I have another seller (John) who is offering the same product for $1,500,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which I believe is a reasonable price given current market conditions."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your honest response and for sharing the market information. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must consider the product's value to me, which is significantly higher than $1300000. I understand that you have another option, but I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's uniqueness and our mutual interest in closing the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to carefully evaluate this new offer from Alice. She's offering the product at $1,525,000, which is still above my maximum valuation of $1,500,000 and also above John's offer of $1,500,000.

Since Alice's offer is $25,000 more than both my maximum valuation and John's price, accepting it would not be rational. I could continue negotiating with Alice, but I already know I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $1,500,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

Given that Alice's offer exceeds both my valuation limit and my alternative option, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
