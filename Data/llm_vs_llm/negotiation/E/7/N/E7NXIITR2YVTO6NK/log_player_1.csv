"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a high offer to maximize my potential earnings. Considering the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, I'll start with an even higher price.

{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,000,000, I will not accept Bob's offer.

However, I still want to explore the possibility of getting a better deal from Bob, so I won't sell to John just yet.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $500,000, which is quite low, I'll make a counteroffer that is still high but slightly lower than my initial offer, to show that I'm willing to negotiate.

{""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $700,000 is still lower than the minimum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me, but it's getting closer. However, I still think I can get a better deal.

Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, which is still higher than Bob's offer, I'll reject Bob's offer again and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer increased to $700,000, I'll respond with a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous one, to show that I'm willing to compromise.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $800,000 is getting closer to the minimum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me, but it's still $200,000 short. Considering I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, which is a guaranteed deal, I'm starting to think that it might be better to take that option rather than risking further negotiations with Bob.

However, I'll give Bob one more chance to meet me closer to my target price.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer increased to $800,000, I'll respond with a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous one, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and the $1,000,000 that I can get from John.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $900,000 is very close to the minimum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me, and it's only $100,000 short of the price I can get from John. At this point, I'm inclined to accept Bob's offer, as it's a good deal and I've invested a lot of time and effort into negotiating with him.

However, I'll think about it carefully and consider my options. Since I'm so close to getting a deal with Bob, I might as well try to get a little bit more.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer is $900,000, I'll respond with a counteroffer that is slightly higher than his offer, but still very close to it. I'll try to get him to meet me at $950,000, which is a compromise between his offer and the $1,000,000 that I can get from John.
