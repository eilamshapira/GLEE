"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product sounds great, but that's a bit above my budget right now. Would you be willing to come down to $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is below our minimum threshold for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer but still reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think!",16000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that we're trying to find a middle ground here. I'm willing to lower the price further to $15500. This is the best I can do while still maintaining the value of the product. What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer. However, I'm still looking for something closer to my budget. How about $9000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. Unfortunately, $9000 is still below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to go down to $15250, which is as low as I can go while still valuing the product appropriately. Let me know if this works for you!",15250.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to reach an agreement. I can lower the price to $15100, which is the absolute bottom line for this product. This is a final offer from my side. Let me know if you can accept this price!",15100.0,Alice,5,
