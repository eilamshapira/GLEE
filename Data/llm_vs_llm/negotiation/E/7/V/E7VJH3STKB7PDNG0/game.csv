Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to sell it for $1500000. Let me know what you think!,1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than what I can pay for this product. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a more reasonable price. I'm willing to offer $550000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale and saves me the trouble of going to John.",550000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer of $550000. However, I believe the product holds greater value. I can let it go for $1200000. This price reflects its worth while still being lower than my initial offer. Let me know if you’re willing to negotiate.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for lowering your offer, Alice. However, $1200000 is still significantly above what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, I have another seller (John) who's offering the exact same product for $800000. That's actually the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer you $650000 for the product. This is higher than my previous offer and gives you a quick, guaranteed sale without further negotiation.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your continued interest and your latest offer of $650000. While I appreciate the increase, I still believe the product is worth more. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it for $900000. This way, it’s a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price. However, I need to be clear that I have a firm alternative offer from John for $800000, which is actually the maximum value of this product to me. There's no incentive for me to pay more than that. In fact, to make it worth my while to continue our negotiation rather than simply going with John's offer, I would need a better price. My final offer is $750000. This is substantially higher than my previous offers and very close to my maximum budget. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to accept John's offer.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and your latest offer of $750000. However, I believe I can still offer you a more competitive price that reflects the value of the product. How about we settle at $850000? It's a substantial reduction from my original asking price and still provides value for both of us. Let me know if this works for you!",850000.0,Alice,7,

"Thanks for continuing to work with me, Alice. I appreciate that you've lowered your price to $850000, but I need to be completely transparent here. John is offering the exact same product for $800000, which is the maximum value this product has to me. There's simply no business reason for me to pay more than that. At this point, I can offer you $780000, which is very close to my absolute limit. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll need to go with John's offer as we're running out of negotiation rounds.",780000.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your transparency and your final offer of $780000. While I understand your position, I still believe that the product is worth more. How about we settle for $800000? This matches John's offer, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I hope we can finalize this deal!",800000.0,Alice,9,
