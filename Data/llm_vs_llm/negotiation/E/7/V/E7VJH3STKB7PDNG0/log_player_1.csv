"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than what I can pay for this product. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a more reasonable price. I'm willing to offer $550000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale and saves me the trouble of going to John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for lowering your offer, Alice. However, $1200000 is still significantly above what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, I have another seller (John) who's offering the exact same product for $800000. That's actually the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer you $650000 for the product. This is higher than my previous offer and gives you a quick, guaranteed sale without further negotiation.

Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price. However, I need to be clear that I have a firm alternative offer from John for $800000, which is actually the maximum value of this product to me. There's no incentive for me to pay more than that. In fact, to make it worth my while to continue our negotiation rather than simply going with John's offer, I would need a better price. My final offer is $750000. This is substantially higher than my previous offers and very close to my maximum budget. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to accept John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

However, I believe I can still offer you a more competitive price that reflects the value of the product. How about we settle at $850,000?

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for continuing to work with me, Alice. I appreciate that you've lowered your price to $850000, but I need to be completely transparent here. John is offering the exact same product for $800000, which is the maximum value this product has to me. There's simply no business reason for me to pay more than that. At this point, I can offer you $780000, which is very close to my absolute limit. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll need to go with John's offer as we're running out of negotiation rounds.
