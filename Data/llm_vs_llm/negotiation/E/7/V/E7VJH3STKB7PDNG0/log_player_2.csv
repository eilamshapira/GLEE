Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than what I can pay for this product. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a more reasonable price. I'm willing to offer $550,000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale and saves me the trouble of going to John."", ""product_price"": 550000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer of $550000. However, I believe the product holds greater value. I can let it go for $1200000. This price reflects its worth while still being lower than my initial offer. Let me know if you’re willing to negotiate.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for lowering your offer, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is still significantly above what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, I have another seller (John) who's offering the exact same product for $800,000. That's actually the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer you $650,000 for the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your continued interest and your latest offer of $650000. While I appreciate the increase, I still believe the product is worth more. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it for $900000. This way, it’s a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price. However, I need to be clear that I have a firm alternative offer from John for $800,000, which is actually the maximum value of this product to me. There's no incentive for me to pay more than that. In fact, to make it worth my while to continue our negotiation rather than simply going with John's offer, I would need a better price. My final offer is $750,000. This is substantially higher than my previous offers and very close to my maximum budget. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to accept John's offer."", ""product_price"": 750000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
