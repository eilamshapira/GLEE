"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it for $140. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value. Would you like to proceed with the purchase?",140.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, I'm looking for a better deal. The product is worth about $110-$115 to me based on my research of similar items. Would you be willing to sell it for $110? This would still give you a good profit while allowing me to stay within my budget.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $110 is too low considering the product's true value. I understand you're looking for a better deal, so I can reduce my initial price to $130. This is still a good value for you while allowing me to maintain a reasonable margin. Would this work for you?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price to $130. That's a step in the right direction. However, I've been comparing similar products in the market and feel that $120 would be a fair price for both of us. At this price, you'd still make a good profit, and I'd be getting a reasonable deal. What do you say to meeting in the middle at $120?",120.0,Bob,4,
