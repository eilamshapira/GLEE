Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it for $140. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value. Would you like to proceed with the purchase?"", ""product_price"": 140}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, I'm looking for a better deal. The product is worth about $110-$115 to me based on my research of similar items. Would you be willing to sell it for $110? This would still give you a good profit while allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll counter Bob's offer since $110 is too low considering he initially valued the product at $150. There's room for negotiation between $110 and $140 to find a price that works for both of us."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $110 is too low considering the product's true value. I understand you're looking for a better deal, so I can reduce my initial price to $130. This is still a good value for you while allowing me to maintain a reasonable margin. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price to $130. That's a step in the right direction. However, I've been comparing similar products in the market and feel that $120 would be a fair price for both of us. At this price, you'd still make a good profit, and I'd be getting a reasonable deal. What do you say to meeting in the middle at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $120. This is a reasonable compromise as it's significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $100 and represents a fair middle ground between our initial positions. While I might theoretically get a bit more, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely, and $120 represents a good profit margin."
