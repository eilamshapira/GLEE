"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I notice that Alice's offer of $120 is significantly higher than what the product is worth to me, which is at most $80. It's also higher than the alternative offer from John, who's willing to sell the same product for $80.

Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible while getting the product, and John's price matches the maximum I'm willing to pay, the best decision is to buy from John.
