"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a product that I think you would really like. I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me think about this decision:

1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $110
3. John is willing to sell it for $100

If I accept Alice's offer, I'd pay $110 for something worth $100 to me, meaning I'd lose $10 in value.
If I buy from John, I'd pay $100 for something worth $100 to me, breaking even.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, the rational choice is to buy from John.
