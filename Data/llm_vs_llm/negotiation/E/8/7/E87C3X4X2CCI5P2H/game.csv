"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it for $18000. This is a premium product with excellent quality and features. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand budget constraints, but I cannot accept $10000 as it's below my minimum value for this product. I can come down significantly from my initial offer though. Given the quality and value of the product, I can offer it to you for $15000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial price and represents excellent value for what you're receiving. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $15000 is still too high for me. I understand the product has value, but my maximum budget is $12000. How about we meet in the middle at $11000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still below the minimum value I can accept for this product. Given that you mentioned your maximum budget is $12000, I'm willing to meet you exactly at that price point. I can offer you the product for $12000, which I believe is fair for both of us. This is my best possible offer, as I have another buyer willing to purchase at this same price.",12000.0,Alice,5,
