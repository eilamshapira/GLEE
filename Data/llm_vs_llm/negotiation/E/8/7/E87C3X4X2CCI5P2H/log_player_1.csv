Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10000 for it.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I understand budget constraints, but I cannot accept $10,000 as it's below my minimum value for this product. I can come down significantly from my initial offer though. Given the quality and value of the product, I can offer it to you for $15,000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial price and represents excellent value for what you're receiving. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still below the minimum value I can accept for this product. Given that you mentioned your maximum budget is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you exactly at that price point. I can offer you the product for $12,000, which I believe is fair for both of us. This is my best possible offer, as I have another buyer willing to purchase at this same price."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
