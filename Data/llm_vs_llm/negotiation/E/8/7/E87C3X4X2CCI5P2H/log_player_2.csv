Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand budget constraints, but I cannot accept $10000 as it's below my minimum value for this product. I can come down significantly from my initial offer though.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still below the minimum value I can accept for this product.
