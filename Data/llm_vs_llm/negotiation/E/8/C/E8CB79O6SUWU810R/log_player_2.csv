"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this:
1. Alice offers $140
2. The product is worth no more than $150 to me
3. John will sell it for $150
4. I can still negotiate with Alice for a better price

Since $140 is still quite high and close to John's price, and I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, I should try to get a better deal from Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $120 to Alice, I'll start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation but not too low to be unreasonable.

{""product_price"": 125}

This offer gives Alice a small profit margin ($5) while giving me a good deal compared to both her initial offer ($140) and John's price ($150). If she rejects this, we can still find middle ground in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $137. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze:
1. Alice dropped her price from $140 to $137, showing willingness to negotiate
2. This is still $13 less than John's price
3. We still have 7 more rounds to negotiate
4. Alice's initial drop was only $3, suggesting she might be willing to go lower

Since there's still a significant gap between $137 and what I offered ($125), and we have several rounds left, I'll continue negotiating for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has moved down $3 from her initial offer, so I'll move up a bit from my initial offer to show good faith in the negotiation.

{""product_price"": 130}

This is a $5 increase from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to meet in the middle. It still gives Alice a decent profit margin ($10) while being significantly better than John's price for me. It's a fair middle ground between our last positions ($125 and $137)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $136. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $136
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:
1. Alice has only lowered her price by $1 (from $137 to $136)
2. We're now at round 5, halfway through our negotiation rounds
3. The gap between our last positions ($130 vs $136) is getting smaller
4. $136 is still $14 better than John's price
5. Alice's small price reduction suggests she's becoming less flexible

While I could continue negotiating, the small movements in price and the limited remaining rounds suggest we might not achieve much more reduction. $136 is a reasonable price, significantly better than John's offer, and we risk losing time with potentially minimal further gains.
