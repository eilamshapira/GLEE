"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $300 is well above my budget for this product. The product is worth no more than $150 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell it to me for that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to sell it for $100? This would be a better deal for me than John's offer and would allow us to close the deal quickly.",100.0,Bob,2,
