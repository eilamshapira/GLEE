"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it will bring great value to you. I'm willing to sell it for $300. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 300}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $300 is well above my budget for this product. The product is worth no more than $150 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell it to me for that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to sell it for $100? This would be a better deal for me than John's offer and would allow us to close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
