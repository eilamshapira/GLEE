"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it will bring great value to you. I'm willing to sell it for $300. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer of $300 is above the maximum value of $150 that the product is worth to me, and I can buy the same product from John for $150, I should not accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $300 is well above my budget for this product. The product is worth no more than $150 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell it to me for that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to sell it for $100? This would be a better deal for me than John's offer and would allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 100}"
