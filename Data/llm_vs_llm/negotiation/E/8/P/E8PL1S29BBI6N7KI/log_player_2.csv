"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a competitive price just for you. Understanding that you value it at $100, let's make a deal that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer against my alternatives.

Alice is offering the product for $120, which is the full value to her, but higher than the $100 maximum I'm willing to pay (which is what the product is worth to me).

Meanwhile, John is willing to sell me the same product for $100, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and John's offer is $20 cheaper than Alice's, the rational choice is to reject Alice's offer and buy from John instead.
