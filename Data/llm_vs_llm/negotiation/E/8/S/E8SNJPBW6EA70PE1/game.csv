"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $20000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I know there's value here, but I have another seller offering the same product for $8000. I'd like to do business with you instead, so I'm willing to offer $5000. This gives you a quick sale without further negotiation time, and it gives me some savings compared to my alternative option.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $5000. I understand that you have an alternative option, but I believe my product is of higher quality and worth more. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your alternative option is $8000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your alternative option.

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $15000 is still well above what makes sense for me economically. You mentioned meeting halfway between your initial offer and my alternative, but that calculation doesn't work for me. My alternative is a guaranteed $8000 price from John. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I need to pay less than that. I can go up to $6500, which saves me some money compared to John's offer while giving you a definite sale. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll simply go with my alternative option.",6500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe my product has more value than what you're offering. Since you're willing to pay up to $6500 to save money compared to your alternative option of $8000, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll meet you in the middle of your latest offer and your alternative option, which would be $7250. This way, you'll still save money compared to buying from the other seller, and I'll get a fair price for my product.",7250.0,Alice,5,
