"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is significantly above my maximum value of $8,000, and it's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $8,000. There's no reason for me to accept this high price, but I should try negotiating with Alice before going to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $20,000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I know there's value here, but I have another seller offering the same product for $8,000. I'd like to do business with you instead, so I'm willing to offer $5,000. This gives you a quick sale without further negotiation time, and it gives me some savings compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $5000. I understand that you have an alternative option, but I believe my product is of higher quality and worth more. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your alternative option is $8000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your alternative option.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price from $20,000 to $15,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $15,000 is still almost double John's price of $8,000 and well above my maximum value. Since Alice acknowledges my alternative option at $8,000, I should continue negotiating but make it clear that I won't pay more than John's price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $15,000 is still well above what makes sense for me economically. You mentioned meeting halfway between your initial offer and my alternative, but that calculation doesn't work for me. My alternative is a guaranteed $8,000 price from John. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I need to pay less than that. I can go up to $6,500, which saves me some money compared to John's offer while giving you a definite sale. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll simply go with my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 6500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe my product has more value than what you're offering. Since you're willing to pay up to $6500 to save money compared to your alternative option of $8000, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll meet you in the middle of your latest offer and your alternative option, which would be $7250. This way, you'll still save money compared to buying from the other seller, and I'll get a fair price for my product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has now offered $7,250, which is below John's price of $8,000. This offer provides me with savings of $750 compared to my alternative option. Since the product is worth up to $8,000 to me, and this price is below that threshold, this is a good deal that satisfies my goal of buying the product while saving money.
