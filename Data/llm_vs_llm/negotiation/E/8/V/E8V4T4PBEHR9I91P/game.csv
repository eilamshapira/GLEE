"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price seems a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I could only do  $50.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand that my initial offer might have been a bit high for you. I'm willing to consider a lower price, but $50 is too low. I can offer it to you for $180. Let me know if this works for you.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still quite a gap. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $65, but that's the highest I can go.",65.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget. However, $65 is still below what I'm comfortable selling the product for. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to make a significant concession. I can offer it to you for $120. This is a substantial reduction from my previous offer, and I hope it's more in line with what you're looking for.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for understanding. I feel like we're getting closer.  To be honest, $80 is the absolute maximum I can justify spending on this.  If that works for you, I'm ready to buy it right now.",80.0,Bob,6,
