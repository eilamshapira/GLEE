Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price seems a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I could only do  $50. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually agreeable price. My counteroffer will be $180. This is still below my initial offer, but significantly higher than Bob's offer of $50, indicating that I'm willing to negotiate but not give away the product at a very low price. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand that my initial offer might have been a bit high for you. I'm willing to consider a lower price, but $50 is too low. I can offer it to you for $180. Let me know if this works for you.""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still quite a gap. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $65, but that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since Bob has increased his offer to $65, it shows he's interested, but there's still a significant gap between his offer and what I'm willing to accept. I'll try to meet him halfway between my last offer and his new offer, but also keep in mind that I have a floor price of $150 that I can sell to John for.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget. However, $65 is still below what I'm comfortable selling the product for. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to make a significant concession. I can offer it to you for $120. This is a substantial reduction from my previous offer, and I hope it's more in line with what you're looking for."", ""product_price"": 120}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for understanding. I feel like we're getting closer.  To be honest, $80 is the absolute maximum I can justify spending on this.  If that works for you, I'm ready to buy it right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Given that Bob's maximum offer is $80, which is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and considering I have a guaranteed offer of $150 from John, it makes more sense to sell the product to John. This ensures I get a fair price for the product without continuing to negotiate with Bob, who seems unlikely to meet my price expectations."
