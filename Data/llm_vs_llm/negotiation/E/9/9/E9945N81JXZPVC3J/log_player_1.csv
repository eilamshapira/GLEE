"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $1,000,000, and knowing that the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, I'll start with a high offer to see if Bob might be willing to pay more than his valuation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Given that Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than both his valuation ($800,000) and my guaranteed alternative with John ($1,000,000), I will reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob offered $600,000, which is well below his valuation of $800,000, I'll lower my initial offer but still keep it above his valuation to leave room for negotiation while maintaining a strong position.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Given that Bob's offer of $700,000 is still significantly lower than my guaranteed option with John ($1,000,000), and we're only in round 4 of 10, I will reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob has moved up from $600,000 to $700,000, showing some willingness to negotiate, I'll reduce my price somewhat but still maintain a strong position given my $1,000,000 alternative with John.

{""product_price"": 900,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Given that Bob's offer ($750,000) is still significantly below my guaranteed option with John ($1,000,000), and Bob's incremental increases suggest he might be willing to go higher, I will reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob has shown a pattern of increasing his offers ($600K → $700K → $750K), but we're now in round 7 of 10, I'll lower my price a bit more but still keep it well above his current offer, considering I always have the $1M option with John.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Given that we're now in round 8 of 10, and Bob's offers are still well below my guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to reach a price point that would be better than my alternative option with John. At this point, it's best to take the guaranteed higher amount.
