Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $13,000 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($12,000) but lower than my initial offer ($14,000), I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

My counteroffer is: $13,500

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.
