"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a relatively high price to maximize my potential earnings. However, I'll also keep in mind that the price should be reasonable enough for Bob to consider making a counteroffer.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $4,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and also lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($10,000), I will reject his offer.

Additionally, selling to John for $10,000 is a safer option, but I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and he might be willing to increase his offer. So, I won't sell to John yet.

I will proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $4,000, I'll try to find a middle ground while still aiming to maximize my earnings. I'll reduce my initial offer of $20,000, but not by too much, to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.

{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's new offer of $5,000 is still lower than my minimum value of $10,000, but it's an increase from his previous offer of $4,000. This suggests that he's willing to negotiate and potentially increase his offer further.

I'll reject his current offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to get a better price from Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob increased his offer from $4,000 to $5,000, I'll try to encourage him to continue increasing his offer. I'll reduce my previous counteroffer of $18,000, but not by too much, to see if Bob is willing to meet me closer to my target price.

{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's new offer of $6,000 is still lower than my minimum value of $10,000, but it's another increase from his previous offers. At this point, I'm starting to think that Bob might not be willing to meet my target price, and I need to consider the option of selling to John for $10,000.

However, I'll give Bob one more chance to increase his offer. If he's willing to continue negotiating, I might be able to get a better price from him.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob increased his offer to $6,000, I'll try to make a more significant concession to encourage him to meet me closer to my target price. I'll reduce my previous counteroffer of $15,000 (which I didn't send, but would have been a reduction from $18,000 and then $15,000 from the previous round) to $12,000.

{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's new offer of $7,000 is still lower than my minimum value of $10,000, and we're running out of rounds to negotiate. At this point, I think it's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer to a price that I'm comfortable with.

Given that I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, which is above my minimum value, I think it's the best choice to sell to John. Bob's offers have been increasing, but not at a rate that suggests he'll meet my target price in the remaining rounds.
