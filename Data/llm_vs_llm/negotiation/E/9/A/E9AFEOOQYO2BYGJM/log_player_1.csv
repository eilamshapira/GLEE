"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $60 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and I have the option to sell to John for $100, I will consider my next steps carefully.

Given that I have 9 more rounds to negotiate and Bob's initial offer is $80, but he offered $60, I think there's room for negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to meet in the middle or get closer to my target price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's initial value for the product is $80, but he offered $60, I'll try to find a middle ground while still being closer to my target price of $100.

{""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer of $70 is still below my target price, but it's getting closer to a reasonable range. However, it's still $30 less than what I can get from John.

Considering I have 7 more rounds to negotiate, I'll reject Bob's offer again and try to make a counteroffer that's more appealing to both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 85}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I already sent the counteroffer in the previous message. To confirm:

{""product_price"": 85}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer of $75 is getting closer to his initial value of $80, but it's still $25 less than what I can get from John.

At this point, I've invested 6 rounds in negotiating with Bob, and I have 4 more rounds to go. However, considering the difference between Bob's offer and John's offer, I think it's time to prioritize getting the best price.

Since Bob's offer is still not close enough to my target price, and I have a guaranteed sale to John for $100, I'll choose to sell the product to John.
