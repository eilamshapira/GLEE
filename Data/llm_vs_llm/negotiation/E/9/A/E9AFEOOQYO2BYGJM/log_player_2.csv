"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Based on the information provided, I'll make a decision that maximizes my benefit.

The product is worth no more than $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $100, which exceeds my valuation. John is willing to sell the same product for $80, which is equal to my maximum valuation.

Alice's current offer isn't beneficial for me since I'd be paying more than the product is worth to me. I should either negotiate for a lower price or buy from John.

Since I can get the product at exactly what it's worth to me from John, and Alice's offer would mean I'm paying more than the product's value to me, I'll reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating.
