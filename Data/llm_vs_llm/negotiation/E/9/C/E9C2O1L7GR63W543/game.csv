Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $180?,180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Given current market conditions, I would be willing to pay $70 for the product. Would this work for you?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $70 is too low for the quality of this product. I have other interested buyers willing to pay significantly more. I can reduce my initial price - would you consider $150? This is a fair price given the product's value.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $150 is still more than I can spend. I understand you have other interested buyers, but I can find similar products for much less elsewhere. I could go up to $85, which I think is a fair price. Would that work for you?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob, but $85 is still significantly below the product's value. I already have a guaranteed buyer at $120, but I'm willing to work with you if we can find a fair middle ground. Would you consider $135? This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer and reflects the true value of the product.",135.0,Alice,5,
