Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $180?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Given current market conditions, I would be willing to pay $70 for the product. Would this work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $70 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $120. There's still room for negotiation to find a better price than John's $120 offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $70 is too low for the quality of this product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $150 is still more than I can spend. I understand you have other interested buyers, but I can find similar products for much less elsewhere. I could go up to $85, which I think is a fair price. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make another counteroffer. Bob's offer of $85 is still well below John's guaranteed $120, but since Bob is willing to negotiate upward, there might still be potential to reach a better price than John's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob, but $85 is still significantly below the product's value. I already have a guaranteed buyer at $120, but I'm willing to work with you if we can find a fair middle ground. Would you consider $135? This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer and reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 135}"
