"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $180? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
2. John is offering the same product for $100
3. Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price

The logical decision is to reject Alice's offer. It makes no sense to accept $180 when I can get it for $100 from John, and the product isn't even worth more than $100 to me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since John is offering the product for $100, and that's my maximum value for the product, I should make a counteroffer significantly lower than $100 to leave room for negotiation while trying to get a better deal than John's price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Given current market conditions, I would be willing to pay $70 for the product. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $70 is too low for the quality of this product. I have other interested buyers willing to pay significantly more. I can reduce my initial price - would you consider $150? This is a fair price given the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $150 is still significantly higher than:
1. John's fixed price of $100
2. My maximum valuation of $100

While Alice did reduce the price by $30, it's still not competitive with John's offer. There's no reason to accept this price when I can get the same product for $100. I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer, but if Alice doesn't come down significantly, I'll go with John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $180 to $150, she's showing some flexibility. However, I need to get the price below $100 to make it worthwhile compared to John's offer. I'll increase my previous offer somewhat but still keep it well below John's price to leave room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $150 is still more than I can spend. I understand you have other interested buyers, but I can find similar products for much less elsewhere. I could go up to $85, which I think is a fair price. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob, but $85 is still significantly below the product's value. I already have a guaranteed buyer at $120, but I'm willing to work with you if we can find a fair middle ground. Would you consider $135? This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer and reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's latest offer of $135 is still higher than both:
1. John's price of $100
2. My maximum valuation of $100

Additionally, Alice has mentioned she has a buyer at $120, which suggests she might not be willing to go below that price. Since we've gone through several rounds of negotiation and Alice's price is still well above John's offer, it's time to end the negotiation and take John's guaranteed price of $100.
