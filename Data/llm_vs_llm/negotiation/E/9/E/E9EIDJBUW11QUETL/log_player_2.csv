I'm going to reject Alice's offer. It's a good starting point, but I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm offering $1,000,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."
