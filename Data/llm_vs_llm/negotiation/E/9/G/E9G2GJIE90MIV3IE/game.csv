"Hello Bob, I have been considering the value of the product and based on its unique features and potential, I am offering it to you at a price of $2000000. I believe this is a fair starting point for the negotiation.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a significantly lower price, considering the current market conditions and my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $800000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. While I understand your perspective, the value of the product justifies a higher price given its features and market potential. How about we meet closer to my initial offer at $1800000? I believe this is a reasonable compromise that reflects the true worth of the product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $1800000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $900000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob. However, $900000 is significantly below the minimum value I'm willing to consider. To move this negotiation forward, I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1600000. I believe this is much closer to a fair market value, considering what the product can offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price, but $1600000 is still above what I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $950000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value and my budget constraints. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,6,
