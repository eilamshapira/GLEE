"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $1,150,000
2. My maximum value for the product is $1,200,000
3. Alice's cost is $800,000, so she has room to negotiate down
4. John's fixed price is $1,200,000

Alice's current offer ($1,150,000) is lower than John's price ($1,200,000), but there's still significant room for negotiation since Alice's cost is only $800,000. I should try to negotiate for a better price with Alice rather than accepting this first offer or buying from John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Let me make a strategic counteroffer:

Since Alice's cost is $800,000 and my maximum value is $1,200,000, I'll start with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than her initial offer but still provides her with a reasonable profit. A price of $900,000 would give her a $100,000 profit while saving me significantly compared to her initial offer and John's price.
