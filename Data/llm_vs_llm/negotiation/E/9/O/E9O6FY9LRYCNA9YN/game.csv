"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal. However, I believe the value of the product is higher than your offer. I'm willing to lower my price to $16500. This is a great opportunity to own a product that is worth every penny. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $15000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,4,
