Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2500000 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on it.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $2200000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $1600000?
