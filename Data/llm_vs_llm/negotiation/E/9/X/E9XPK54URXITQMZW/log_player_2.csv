"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. If you're interested, please consider my offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to evaluate Alice's offer against my constraints. 

The product is worth no more than $100 to me, but Alice is offering it for $200, which exceeds my valuation. Meanwhile, John is offering the same product for $100, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and Alice's price is significantly higher than John's, the logical choice is to reject Alice's offer and buy from John instead.
