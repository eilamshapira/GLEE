"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, and her initial offer is $1,000,000 (which is equal to John's price), it makes sense to reject and make a counteroffer. There's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice since she has room for profit even at a lower price. If the negotiation doesn't work out, I can always fall back to John's offer of $1,000,000 later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 850000}

Reasoning: I'm offering $850,000 which is:
1. Above Alice's cost ($800,000), giving her a $50,000 profit margin
2. Significantly below both Alice's initial offer and John's price ($1,000,000)
3. A reasonable starting point that leaves room for further negotiation if needed
4. Would save me $150,000 compared to buying from John

This offer is strategically chosen because it gives Alice a reasonable profit while still being advantageous for me. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate further, and I always have John's offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Reasoning: I should accept Alice's offer of $900,000 because:
1. It's $100,000 less than John's price ($1,000,000)
2. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000
3. While we could try to negotiate further, $900,000 gives Alice a reasonable profit ($100,000 above her cost) while giving me a good savings
4. There's a risk that if we continue negotiating, Alice might become less flexible or we might lose the opportunity
5. It's a fair compromise between my counteroffer ($850,000) and her initial price ($1,000,000)

This is a good deal that achieves my goal of saving money while still being fair to both parties."
