Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get more than my minimum acceptable price of $80.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $85 is above my minimum threshold of $80 and only slightly higher than John's guaranteed offer, it's not a very attractive offer. I believe there's room to negotiate for a better price without risking losing the sale completely.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial price but still maintain a good margin above Bob's offer of $85.
