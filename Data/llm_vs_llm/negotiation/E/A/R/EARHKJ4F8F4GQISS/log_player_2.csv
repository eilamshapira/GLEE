"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer is $120, which is the same price as John's offer, and this price is at my maximum value for the product, there's no advantage in negotiating further with Alice. I also can't get a better deal by going to John since his price is the same.

However, since I have the opportunity to make a counteroffer to Alice, it makes sense to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price. If Alice doesn't accept my lower counteroffer, I can always fall back to either accepting Alice's original price or buying from John later.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's $120 offer to leave room for negotiation while still being reasonable.

{""product_price"": 85}

This offer is about 30% lower than Alice's initial price. If Alice doesn't accept this, we can still negotiate upward, and I always have the option to go back to either Alice's original offer or John's $120 price if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has reduced her price from $120 to $105, which is a good improvement and $15 less than both her original offer and John's price. While we might potentially negotiate for an even lower price, there's a risk that Alice could become frustrated and return to a higher price. Since $105 represents a meaningful savings from my maximum value of $120, and it's significantly better than John's alternative, I'll accept this offer.
