"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $13000, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get a price closer to what I'm looking for.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. How about we settle on $10750? I think this is a fair price that takes into account both of our interests.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  While I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price, $10750 is still a bit lower than I'd like.  Would you be willing to go up to $11250?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a great deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable paying $11250. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we settle on $11000? This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",11000.0,Bob,6,
