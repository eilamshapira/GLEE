"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she's asking for $15,000, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay for this product. This is also exactly the same price that John is offering.

Since Alice is selling it at $15,000 and it only costs her $10,000, there's clearly room for negotiation. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer to try to save some money.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $12,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has lowered her price to $14,000, which is $1,000 less than John's price. This is a better offer, but I think there's still room for negotiation since the product costs Alice only $10,000.

Since Alice has moved down from her initial offer, it shows she's willing to negotiate. I should accept this improved offer rather than risk losing it by pushing too hard, especially since it's already better than my alternative option with John.
