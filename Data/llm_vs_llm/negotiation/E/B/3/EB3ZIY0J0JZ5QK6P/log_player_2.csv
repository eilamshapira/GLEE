"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The choice is clear here. Since:
1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $2,000,000 (which is way above my maximum value)
3. John offers the product for $800,000

The best decision is to buy from John for $800,000. This saves me $1,200,000 compared to Alice's offer and matches my maximum valuation of the product."
