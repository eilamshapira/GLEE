"Hello Bob, I have a product that I'm sure will be of interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1450000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential value to your business.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1450000 is beyond my budget. I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to offer $900000. This is a serious offer based on my valuation.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand budget constraints, but I need to be transparent that this product is worth at least $1200000 to me, as I have another buyer (John) willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer to $1300000, which is closer to what the product is truly worth. This represents a $150000 reduction from my initial offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but my budget remains firm. My maximum valuation for the product is $1000000, and John is offering me that price. To keep this negotiation going, I'll offer $950000. This is my best offer at this point.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your updated offer. I appreciate you moving closer to what would work for both of us. However, I need to be clear that $950000 is still significantly below what I can accept. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1200000, which represents my absolute minimum. If we're going to close a deal, I need at least $1200000. But I value our potential business relationship, so I'm willing to offer you $1220000, which is just slightly above my minimum threshold. This gives you the opportunity to acquire the product while allowing me to meet my financial requirements.",1220000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I simply cannot exceed my maximum valuation of $1000000. My final offer is $975000. If you cannot accept this, I will have to pursue other options.",975000.0,Bob,6,
