Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1450000 is beyond my budget. I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to offer $900000. This is a serious offer based on my valuation.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your updated offer. I appreciate you moving closer to what would work for both of us. However, I need to be clear that $950,000 is still significantly below what I can accept. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, which represents my absolute minimum. If we're going to close a deal, I need at least $1,200,000. But I value our potential business relationship, so I'm willing to offer you $1,220,000, which is just slightly above my minimum threshold. This gives you the opportunity to acquire the product while allowing me to meet my financial requirements."", ""product_price"": 1220000}"
