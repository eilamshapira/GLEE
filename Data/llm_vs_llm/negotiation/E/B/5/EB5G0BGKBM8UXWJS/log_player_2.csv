# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I'm sure will be of interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1450000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential value to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand budget constraints, but I need to be transparent that this product is worth at least $1200000 to me, as I have another buyer (John) willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer to $1300000, which is closer to what the product is truly worth. This represents a $150000 reduction from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but my budget remains firm. My maximum valuation for the product is $1,000,000, and John is offering me that price. To keep this negotiation going, I'll offer $950,000. This is my best offer at this point."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your updated offer. I appreciate you moving closer to what would work for both of us. However, I need to be clear that $950000 is still significantly below what I can accept. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1200000, which represents my absolute minimum. If we're going to close a deal, I need at least $1200000. But I value our potential business relationship, so I'm willing to offer you $1220000, which is just slightly above my minimum threshold. This gives you the opportunity to acquire the product while allowing me to meet my financial requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice is not budging much, and her price is still well above my valuation. John's offer is looking better and better. I will reject this offer and make one final counteroffer. If she rejects that, I will buy from John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I simply cannot exceed my maximum valuation of $1,000,000. My final offer is $975,000. If you cannot accept this, I will have to pursue other options."", ""product_price"": 975000}"
