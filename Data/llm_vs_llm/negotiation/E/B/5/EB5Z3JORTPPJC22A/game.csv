"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is quite high for my budget. Given the market value and my research, I would be willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but $120 is too low for the quality and value this product offers. My cost is $150, and I can't go below that. However, I can come down from my initial offer to $220, which I believe is fair considering the product's quality. What do you think?",220.0,Alice,3,
