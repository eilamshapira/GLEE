Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is quite high for my budget. Given the market value and my research, I would be willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but $120 is too low for the quality and value this product offers. My cost is $150, and I can't go below that. However, I can come down from my initial offer to $220, which I believe is fair considering the product's quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 220}"
