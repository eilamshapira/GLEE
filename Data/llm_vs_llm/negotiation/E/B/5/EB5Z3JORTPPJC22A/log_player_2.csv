"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a quality product for sale. I believe it offers excellent value and would be a great addition for you. I'm offering it for $250. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Given that my maximum value for the product is $150, and John is willing to sell it at exactly $150, Alice's offer of $250 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. Since Alice's initial offer is well above my maximum value, I should reject it and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's below my maximum value but leaves some room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is quite high for my budget. Given the market value and my research, I would be willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but $120 is too low for the quality and value this product offers. My cost is $150, and I can't go below that. However, I can come down from my initial offer to $220, which I believe is fair considering the product's quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $220. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $220
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has revealed that her cost is $150, which coincidentally is also John's selling price and my maximum value. Since Alice is still asking for $220 (well above my maximum value of $150), and John is offering it at $150, it makes more economic sense to buy from John. Even if I continue negotiating with Alice, she's unlikely to go below her stated cost of $150, so I can't get a better deal than John's offer.
