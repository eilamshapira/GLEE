Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $18000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and what it can bring to you.,18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only consider it if the price is significantly lower. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $4000.",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $4000 is significantly below the actual worth. I can come down to $15000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the quality and value of the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $15000 is still above my budget. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $6000. I believe this is a reasonable price, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thanks for increasing your offer, Bob. I understand budget constraints. However, the product's true value is far above $6000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your budget at $13500. I hope this works for you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, $13500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer again to $7000, which is getting close to the maximum I'm willing to pay. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price soon.",7000.0,Bob,6,
