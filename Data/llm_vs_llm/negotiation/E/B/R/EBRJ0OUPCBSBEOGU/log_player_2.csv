You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is higher than our maximum budget and what John is offering. We should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer and John's price, giving us room to bargain upwards if needed."
