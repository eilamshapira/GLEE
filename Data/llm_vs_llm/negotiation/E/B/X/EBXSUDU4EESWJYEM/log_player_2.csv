"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire a truly unique product.  I know its value to me is substantial, at least $1500000, and I believe it could be worth significantly more to the right buyer.  I'm offering it to you for $2500000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested party. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to make a decision based on my budget and the value of the product to me.

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $2,500,000, which far exceeds both my valuation and my alternative option.

John is offering the same product for $800,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

The logical choice is to buy from John.
