"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given the options:

*   **Alice's Offer:** $14,000
*   **Buy from John:** $15,000

Since the product is worth $15,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $14,000, it's a better deal than buying from John. Buying from Alice saves me money.

Therefore, the best decision is to accept Alice's offer.
