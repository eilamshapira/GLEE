"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can we meet somewhere in between?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. How about we settle on $160? I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $160 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of your offer and my previous offer. How about $140?",140.0,Bob,4,
