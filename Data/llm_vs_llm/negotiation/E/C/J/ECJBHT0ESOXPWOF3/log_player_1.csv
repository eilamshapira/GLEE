Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for both of us. I'm looking to get a fair price for it, considering its value and rarity."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price point around $700000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $700,000 is below my minimum acceptable price and I believe Bob is willing to pay more, given that the product is worth $1,000,000 to him."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that we're still far apart, but I'm willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value and your initial interest, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my initial offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I understand that we both want to find a fair price. With that in mind, I'm ready to raise my offer to $750000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Although Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price and what I believe the product is worth to him. Since $750,000 is closer to $800,000 (the price John is offering), I need to carefully consider my next move to maximize the sale price. I'll try to meet Bob halfway between my last offer and his new offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for raising your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering your latest offer and my previous one, I'm willing to make a concession.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're getting closer, Alice. I appreciate your concession. To keep the negotiation moving forward, I'm ready to raise my offer to $787500. I believe this is a fair middle ground considering both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $787,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $787,500 is very close to John's offer of $800,000, but still slightly lower. Since I have the option to sell to John for $800,000, I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, given that the product is worth $1,000,000 to him. I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly below my previous one, to see if Bob is willing to meet me at a price that's more favorable to me than John's offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. We're indeed getting closer, and I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price.
