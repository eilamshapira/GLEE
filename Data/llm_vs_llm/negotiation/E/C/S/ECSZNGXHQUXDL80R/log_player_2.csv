{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below John's $150 price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand $130 might still seem high, but considering the quality and value of the product, it's a reasonable price. Would you be willing to meet at $125?

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about $110? That feels like a fair compromise."",

We're splitting the difference between her previous offer and our counteroffer.  This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a good deal."

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $115? It's a fair price and I believe it reflects the value of the product well.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is getting closer to our desired price range, and this price is low enough that it's worth accepting.  We save a decent amount compared to John's offer."
