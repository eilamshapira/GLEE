"Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a truly unique asset, valued at no less than $1200000 to me. I'm willing to start the conversation at $1500000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I believe it holds tremendous value for the right buyer. Let's discuss further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, I should be transparent that the product is worth no more than $1000000 to me. In fact, I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $1000000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product, which would give you a quick sale while saving me from having to go with John's option. Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your candor. While $800000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1100000.  This price still allows me to recoup a fair portion of the value I place on this product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and find an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for coming down in price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must emphasize that I can purchase this exact product from John for $1000000 at any time, which represents my absolute ceiling on this transaction. In fact, for me to choose to do business with you instead, I would need a better price than that. I'm willing to raise my offer to $900000, which gives you a quick sale while still providing me with some savings compared to my alternative option. This seems like a fair middle ground that benefits us both.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your position.  While $900000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still unable to accept it. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1000000.  This is a fair price that recognizes both our needs.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
