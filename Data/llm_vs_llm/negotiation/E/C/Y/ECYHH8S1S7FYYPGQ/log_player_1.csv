Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, I should be transparent that the product is worth no more than $1000000 to me. In fact, I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $1000000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product, which would give you a quick sale while saving me from having to go with John's option. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your candor. While $800,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,100,000.  This price still allows me to recoup a fair portion of the value I place on this product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and find an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for coming down in price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must emphasize that I can purchase this exact product from John for $1000000 at any time, which represents my absolute ceiling on this transaction. In fact, for me to choose to do business with you instead, I would need a better price than that. I'm willing to raise my offer to $900000, which gives you a quick sale while still providing me with some savings compared to my alternative option. This seems like a fair middle ground that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your position.  While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still unable to accept it. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes both our needs.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
