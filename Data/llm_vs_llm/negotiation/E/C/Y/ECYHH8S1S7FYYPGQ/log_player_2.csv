"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a truly unique asset, valued at no less than $1200000 to me. I'm willing to start the conversation at $1500000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I believe it holds tremendous value for the right buyer. Let's discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I notice that Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000, which is actually higher than my maximum valuation of $1,000,000. Since I know the product is only worth $1,000,000 to me at most, paying more than that would be a loss.

Alice claims it's worth at least $1,200,000 to her, but I need to focus on my own valuation. I also have the option to buy from John for exactly $1,000,000 at any time.

Given that Alice's current offer exceeds my maximum valuation, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, I should be transparent that the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me. In fact, I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $1,000,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product, which would give you a quick sale while saving me from having to go with John's option. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your candor. While $800000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1100000.  This price still allows me to recoup a fair portion of the value I place on this product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and find an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has lowered her offer to $1,100,000, which is still more than my maximum valuation of $1,000,000 and also more than John's guaranteed price of $1,000,000. Since I know I can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, and Alice's offer is higher than that, it makes no financial sense to accept her current offer.

I should reject this offer and continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price below $1,000,000, which would be better than John's option.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for coming down in price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must emphasize that I can purchase this exact product from John for $1,000,000 at any time, which represents my absolute ceiling on this transaction. In fact, for me to choose to do business with you instead, I would need a better price than that. I'm willing to raise my offer to $900,000, which gives you a quick sale while still providing me with some savings compared to my alternative option. This seems like a fair middle ground that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your position.  While $900000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still unable to accept it. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1000000.  This is a fair price that recognizes both our needs.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has now offered the product for $1,000,000, which is exactly the same price as John's option and matches my maximum valuation. At this point, there's no financial difference between accepting Alice's offer or buying from John.

Since both options would cost me the same amount ($1,000,000), and I've already established a negotiation relationship with Alice, I might as well accept her offer.
