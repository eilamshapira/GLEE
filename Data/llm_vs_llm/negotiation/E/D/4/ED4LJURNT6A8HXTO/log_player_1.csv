Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to choose a price for the product that maximizes my expected profit, knowing that if Bob rejects, I can still sell it to John for $800,000.

Since I don't know how much the product is worth to Bob, I need to set a price high enough to increase my profit if Bob accepts, but not so high that he's certain to reject. Given that my reservation value is $800,000 (what I can get from John), I should set a price significantly higher than this.

I'll offer a price of $1,200,000, which is 50% higher than my reservation value. This gives me a substantial upside if Bob accepts, while protecting me with the guaranteed sale to John if Bob declines.
