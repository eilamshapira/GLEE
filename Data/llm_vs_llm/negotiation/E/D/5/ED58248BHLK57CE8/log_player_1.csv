Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm offering the price of $12,000 because:
1. I know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob
2. If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell to John for $12,000
3. There's no incentive for me to offer a lower price since I won't sell for less than $12,000
4. This maximizes my potential profit while ensuring I'll get at least $12,000 for the product"
