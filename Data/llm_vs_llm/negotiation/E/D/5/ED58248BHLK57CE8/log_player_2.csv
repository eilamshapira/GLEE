"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $12,000
2. John's price is also $12,000
3. The product is worth $12,000 to me (maximum I'm willing to pay)

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($12,000), and this is exactly my maximum valuation, I am indifferent between the two sellers. However, since Alice made the first offer and there's no advantage in rejecting or buying from John, I might as well accept Alice's offer.
