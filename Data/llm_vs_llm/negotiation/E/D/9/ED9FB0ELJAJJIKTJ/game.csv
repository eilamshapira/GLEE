"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the market value. Let me know if we can work something out.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. Given the exceptional quality of this product, I cannot go as low as $700000. How about we settle at $900000? I believe this price fairly reflects its unique value. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your new price. How about $800000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet halfway. Considering the product's exceptional quality and the market demand, Iâ€™m willing to edge closer to your range. Would you agree to a final price of $850000? I believe this price strikes a fair balance for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850000. However, I was really hoping to get the product for a price closer to $800000, which I believe is a fair market value. I'm willing to slightly increase my offer to $820000, but that's as high as I'm comfortable going. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",820000.0,Bob,6,
