"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16000, considering its value and uniqueness. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to meet somewhere closer to my initial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be open to discussing further.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  While $16000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $13000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",13000.0,Bob,4,
