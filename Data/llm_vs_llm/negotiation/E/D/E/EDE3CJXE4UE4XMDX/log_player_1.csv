Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $18,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is lower than what John is willing to pay ($12,000), and it's also lower than the product's value to me, I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000, considering its value and uniqueness. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to meet somewhere closer to my initial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be open to discussing further."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  While $16000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $13000.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $13,000 is higher than what John is willing to pay ($12,000), I'll accept Bob's offer. This way, I'll earn more money for the product than I would by selling it to John."
