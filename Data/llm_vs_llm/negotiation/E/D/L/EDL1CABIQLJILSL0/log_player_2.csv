"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115. It's a great deal considering its value to you!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's initial offer of $115 is close to my maximum budget of $120, but still a bit high, I'd like to try to negotiate a better price. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, hoping to anchor the negotiation at a lower price point.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $105 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Since we're $15 apart ($105 - $90), meeting in the middle would actually be around $97.50. I'll try to use this to my advantage and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one, but still lower than Alice's current offer. I'll aim for that midpoint of $97.50, but round it down to $97 to see if Alice will be willing to accept it.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I'm getting closer to what I'm comfortable with, but I was thinking more along the lines of $97. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 97}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $102 is getting closer to what I'm willing to pay, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since Alice is willing to compromise, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one, but still lower than $102.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's a small increment from my previous offer of $97. I'll try $100, which is still lower than Alice's current offer of $102, but getting closer to a mutually acceptable price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $97 and $102. How about $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
