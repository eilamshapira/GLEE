"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700000 is significantly lower than what I need for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial price.  How about $900000? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let's try to make this work.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $750000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $750000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,
