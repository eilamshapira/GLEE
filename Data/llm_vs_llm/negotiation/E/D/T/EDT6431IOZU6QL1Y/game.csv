"Hello Alice, thank you for your continued negotiation. I'm getting closer to my budget limit, but I'm still interested in the product. I'd like to propose a price of $12000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this price is reasonable, considering the product's value and the fact that I can still purchase it from John for $15000. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",12000.0,Bob,6,
