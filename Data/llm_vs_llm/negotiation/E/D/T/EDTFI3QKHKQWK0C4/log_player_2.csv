"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $150, which is above my maximum value, I should not accept her offer. John is offering the exact same product for $120, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.
