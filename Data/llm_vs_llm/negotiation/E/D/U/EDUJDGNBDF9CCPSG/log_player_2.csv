"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my budget and what John offers. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

This is a starting point for negotiation. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for me to go up while staying well below John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice is coming down, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. Getting closer to John's price gives me a good fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to move, but I'm still aiming for a price significantly lower than her last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

The price is getting closer to what I'm willing to pay, but I'm still holding out for a better deal since I have John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 8500
}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, showing willingness to compromise while still aiming to stay below $9,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the difference is now too small to justify further negotiation. Buying from John for $10,000 is the safer and more economical choice."
