"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to offer $400000 for the product.",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $400000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise to find a price that works for both of us. I'm proposing a price of $1000000. This still allows me to recoup a substantial portion of the value of the product, and it leaves room for us to negotiate further if needed.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1000000 is still above my target price. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $600000, which I believe is a fair price considering our previous discussions.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, $600000 is still a significant distance from my target price. However, I want to reach a mutually agreeable solution.  I'm willing to lower my price to $800000.
