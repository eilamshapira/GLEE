"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling me this product, but I need to let you know that I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $10000. Since that's actually the maximum value this product has for me, I can't justify paying $12000. I'd be happy to purchase from you instead if you can offer a better price - would you consider $8500? This would give me some incentive to buy from you rather than the alternative.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I want to ensure you receive a great deal while valuing the product's worth. Let's meet in the middle at $9500. I believe this price reflects the product's true value and gives you a bit of savings over the other options.",9500.0,Alice,3,
