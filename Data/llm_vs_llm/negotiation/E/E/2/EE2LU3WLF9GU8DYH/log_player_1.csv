Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling me this product, but I need to let you know that I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $10000. Since that's actually the maximum value this product has for me, I can't justify paying $12000. I'd be happy to purchase from you instead if you can offer a better price - would you consider $8500? This would give me some incentive to buy from you rather than the alternative. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I want to ensure you receive a great deal while valuing the product's worth. Let's meet in the middle at $9,500.
