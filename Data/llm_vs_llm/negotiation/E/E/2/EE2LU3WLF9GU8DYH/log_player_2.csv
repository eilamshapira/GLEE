"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this fantastic product at a competitive price. I believe it's worth the investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to consider my options carefully here. Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is actually $2,000 more than what John is willing to sell it for ($10,000). The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, so Alice's offer doesn't make financial sense.

Since John's price matches my maximum valuation, I should either buy from John immediately or try to negotiate a better deal with Alice first.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling me this product, but I need to let you know that I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $10,000. Since that's actually the maximum value this product has for me, I can't justify paying $12,000. I'd be happy to purchase from you instead if you can offer a better price - would you consider $8,500? This would give me some incentive to buy from you rather than the alternative."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I want to ensure you receive a great deal while valuing the product's worth. Let's meet in the middle at $9500. I believe this price reflects the product's true value and gives you a bit of savings over the other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has countered with $9,500, which is $500 less than John's price of $10,000. Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and Alice's offer allows me to save $500 compared to buying from John, this is a good deal.
