"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking to get a good deal, so I'm starting with a price of $150. Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I need to be honest - the product is only worth $100 to me. In fact, I've found another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for exactly $100. I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair deal, so I'm willing to offer $85 for the product. This gives you a quick sale and gives me a bit of savings compared to my alternative option. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your honest feedback and for making an offer. I understand that you have an alternative option to buy the product from John for $100, but I still believe my product is worth more than that. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $85, I'm willing to come down from my initial price of $150, but I still need to get a fair value for my product. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a significant discount from my initial price. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to continue negotiating.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, I need to be clear that this product is only worth $100 to me, and that's exactly what John is charging. For me to choose to buy from you instead, I would need a better price than my alternative. I'm willing to offer $90, which would save me $10 compared to buying from John, while still giving you a sale. If we can't reach an agreement close to this price, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I understand that you have a clear alternative option with John at $100, and I respect that. However, I still believe my product has value beyond that price point. Considering your latest offer of $90, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you halfway between my previous offer of $120 and your offer of $90. I'm now offering the product to you for $110. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll consider it seriously. If we can't reach an agreement, I do have the option to sell to John for $100, so I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for coming down further on your price. I appreciate the negotiation and your willingness to compromise. However, I must emphasize that the product is worth exactly $100 to me, which is what John is charging. For me to choose buying from you, I would need some savings compared to my alternative. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product, which would give you a slightly better deal than selling to John for $100 as you mentioned. This is my best offer, as paying more than $100 wouldn't make financial sense for me given my alternative. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price point.",95.0,Bob,6,
