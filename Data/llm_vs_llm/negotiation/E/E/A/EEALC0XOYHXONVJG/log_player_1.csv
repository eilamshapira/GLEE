Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I need to be honest - the product is only worth $100 to me. In fact, I've found another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for exactly $100. I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair deal, so I'm willing to offer $85 for the product. This gives you a quick sale and gives me a bit of savings compared to my alternative option. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $85 because it's lower than my minimum acceptable price. Since I know John is willing to buy the product from me for $100, I'm not in a rush to accept a lower offer. I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping we can meet at a price that's more favorable to me. My next offer will be $120."

I understand that you have an alternative option to buy the product from John for $100, but I still believe my product is worth more than that. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $85, I'm willing to come down from my initial price of $150, but I still need to get a fair value for my product. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a significant discount from my initial price. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to continue negotiating."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, I need to be clear that this product is only worth $100 to me, and that's exactly what John is charging. For me to choose to buy from you instead, I would need a better price than my alternative. I'm willing to offer $90, which would save me $10 compared to buying from John, while still giving you a sale. If we can't reach an agreement close to this price, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90 because it's still lower than I'm comfortable with. Although Bob is willing to pay a bit more than his previous offer, I know that John is willing to buy the product from me for $100, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, trying to meet him halfway. My next offer will be $110."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I understand that you have a clear alternative option with John at $100, and I respect that. However, I still believe my product has value beyond that price point. Considering your latest offer of $90, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you halfway between my previous offer of $120 and your offer of $90. I'm now offering the product to you for $110. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll consider it seriously. If we can't reach an agreement, I do have the option to sell to John for $100, so I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for coming down further on your price. I appreciate the negotiation and your willingness to compromise. However, I must emphasize that the product is worth exactly $100 to me, which is what John is charging. For me to choose buying from you, I would need some savings compared to my alternative. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product, which would give you a slightly better deal than selling to John for $100 as you mentioned. This is my best offer, as paying more than $100 wouldn't make financial sense for me given my alternative. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

I've decided to sell the product to John for $100. Bob's latest offer of $95 is close, but since I know I can get $100 from John, it makes more sense to sell to him. I've negotiated with Bob to try and get a better price, but ultimately, selling to John guarantees me the highest price I can get, which is $100. This way, I ensure I get the best deal possible without risking further negotiation that might not yield a better result."
