"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking to get a good deal, so I'm starting with a price of $150. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me think about this offer. The product is worth $100 to me, so I wouldn't want to pay more than that. Alice is offering it for $150, which is $50 more than my maximum value. 

I know that John is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $100, which matches my maximum value. This means I have no reason to accept Alice's current offer of $150.

I could try to negotiate with Alice, but since I already have a guaranteed option to buy at $100 from John, there's no reason to pay more than that.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I need to be honest - the product is only worth $100 to me. In fact, I've found another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for exactly $100. I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair deal, so I'm willing to offer $85 for the product. This gives you a quick sale and gives me a bit of savings compared to my alternative option. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your honest feedback and for making an offer. I understand that you have an alternative option to buy the product from John for $100, but I still believe my product is worth more than that. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $85, I'm willing to come down from my initial price of $150, but I still need to get a fair value for my product. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a significant discount from my initial price. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to continue negotiating. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation:

Alice is now offering the product for $120, which is still $20 more than the product is worth to me ($100).

I know I can buy the same product from John for $100, which is exactly what the product is worth to me.

There's no reason for me to accept an offer to pay more than the product's value to me, especially when I have an alternative at exactly the right price.

However, I need to be clear that this product is only worth $100 to me, and that's exactly what John is charging. For me to choose to buy from you instead, I would need a better price than my alternative. I'm willing to offer $90, which would save me $10 compared to buying from John, while still giving you a sale. If we can't reach an agreement close to this price, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I understand that you have a clear alternative option with John at $100, and I respect that. However, I still believe my product has value beyond that price point. Considering your latest offer of $90, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you halfway between my previous offer of $120 and your offer of $90. I'm now offering the product to you for $110. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll consider it seriously. If we can't reach an agreement, I do have the option to sell to John for $100, so I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.

Alice is now offering the product for $110, which is still $10 more than the product is worth to me ($100).

I have the option to buy the same product from John for $100, which exactly matches the maximum value I place on this product.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, there's no reason for me to pay $110 when I can get the same product for $100.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for coming down further on your price. I appreciate the negotiation and your willingness to compromise. However, I must emphasize that the product is worth exactly $100 to me, which is what John is charging. For me to choose buying from you, I would need some savings compared to my alternative. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product, which would give you a slightly better deal than selling to John for $100 as you mentioned. This is my best offer, as paying more than $100 wouldn't make financial sense for me given my alternative. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price point."", ""product_price"": 95}"
