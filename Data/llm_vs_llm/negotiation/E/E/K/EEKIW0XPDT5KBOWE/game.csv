"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is too low for me. Given that you mentioned the product's value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to offer it at $1700000, which would still provide you with value while better reflecting the product's worth.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1700000 is still above what I'm willing to pay. Considering the product's value to me is $1500000, I'm prepared to go up to $1350000. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
