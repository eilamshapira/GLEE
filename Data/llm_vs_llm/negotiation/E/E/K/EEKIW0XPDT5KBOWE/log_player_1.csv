Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe the product's value to me tops out at $1500000. Given this, I'm willing to purchase it at $1200000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a new counteroffer to Bob. Since he revealed that the product is worth $1,500,000 to him, and that's also my minimum acceptable price, I should try to negotiate for a price closer to that value.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too low for me. Given that you mentioned the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to offer it at $1,700,000, which would still provide you with value while better reflecting the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1700000 is still above what I'm willing to pay. Considering the product's value to me is $1500000, I'm prepared to go up to $1350000. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's final offer of $1,350,000 is below John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000, and Bob has indicated this is his final offer, it makes the most financial sense to sell to John. This ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price and actually gives me $150,000 more than Bob's final offer."
