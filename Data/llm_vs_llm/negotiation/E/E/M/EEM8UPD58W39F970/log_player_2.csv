# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  How does $10000 sound? It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
