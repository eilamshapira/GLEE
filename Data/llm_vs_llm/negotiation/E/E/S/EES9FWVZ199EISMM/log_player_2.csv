"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer ($150) is higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120), I'll reject this offer. It makes no sense to accept a price that's higher than my maximum value, and it's also higher than my alternative option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 90}

I'll offer $90. This is significantly below John's price of $120, giving me room to negotiate upward if needed while still potentially saving money compared to buying from John. If Alice rejects this, we can continue negotiating, and I still have the option to go to John's fixed price of $120 as a fallback."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $120. Since this price equals both John's price and my maximum value, and considering Alice has already reduced her price significantly from $150, this seems like a fair deal. There's no advantage in continuing to negotiate or switching to John since we've reached the same price point."
