"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $1700000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1000000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $1600000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1600000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my financial limits. Let me know if this works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, $1100000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer the product to you for $1550000, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going. If this doesn't work for you, I may need to consider other options.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1550000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $1150000, which is my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
