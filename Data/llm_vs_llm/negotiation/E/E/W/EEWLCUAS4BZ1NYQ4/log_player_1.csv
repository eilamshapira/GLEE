"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $1,700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth and I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $1700000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to both of us, I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to reach a more mutually beneficial price. Selling to John is an option, but I want to explore the possibility of getting a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $1,600,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1600000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my financial limits. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still lower than the product's worth to both of us, and it's also lower than what John is willing to pay. However, I want to try to get a better deal with Bob before selling to John. I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer the product to you for $1,550,000, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going. If this doesn't work for you, I may need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1550000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1550000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $1150000, which is my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still lower than what John is willing to pay, and Bob has indicated that it's his final offer. Given that I've already made several compromises and Bob is unwilling to meet me at a higher price, I think it's best to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is a better deal for me."
