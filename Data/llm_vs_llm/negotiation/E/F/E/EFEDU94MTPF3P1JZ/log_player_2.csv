"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an amazing product that I believe you will find incredibly valuable. I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a great deal for something of its quality and potential benefit to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Based on the information provided, my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible.

Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which exceeds the product's worth to me (no more than $10,000).

Meanwhile, John is willing to sell the same product for $10,000, which matches the maximum value I place on the product.

Since my goal is to save money and I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at a lower price, I should choose that option.
