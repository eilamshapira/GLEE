"Hi Bob, I'm happy to discuss selling you this product. Considering its value and the care I've put into it, I'm offering it to you for $20000. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand that's a bit outside your budget. However, I can't go that low. Considering the product's quality and the investment I've made, the lowest I can go is $18000. What do you say?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $18000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $14000? That's a fair offer considering its value to me.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm really trying to find a price that works for both of us. Since I can't go as low as $14000, my absolute bottom line is $16000. That's the lowest I can go. If you agree, we have a deal. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I can tell you're serious about finding a compromise. To be honest, $15000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If you're firm at $16000, I understand, but I'm hoping we can make this work.",15000.0,Bob,6,
