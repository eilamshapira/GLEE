Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to discuss selling you this product. Considering its value and the care I've put into it, I'm offering it to you for $20,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10000. Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Considering Bob's counteroffer is significantly below what I value the product at, and even below what John is offering, I will reject his offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand that's a bit outside your budget. However, I can't go that low. Considering the product's quality and the investment I've made, the lowest I can go is $18,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $18000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $14000? That's a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a tough one. $14,000 is still less than my minimum value of $15,000. However, it's close. I also don't want to lose Bob completely, and I'm not sure I can get a higher offer from him. On the other hand, John is waiting in the wings with a solid $15,000 offer.

I'm going to hold out for a bit more.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm really trying to find a price that works for both of us. Since I can't go as low as $14,000, my absolute bottom line is $16,000. That's the lowest I can go. If you agree, we have a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I can tell you're serious about finding a compromise. To be honest, $15000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If you're firm at $16000, I understand, but I'm hoping we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a very close call! Bob is offering exactly what John is. Since my goal is to maximize profit and I value the product at $15,000, accepting either offer is the same.

I will accept Bob's offer because I want to keep the negotiation going.
