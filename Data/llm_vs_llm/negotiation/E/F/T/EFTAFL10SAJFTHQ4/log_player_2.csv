"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to discuss selling you this product. Considering its value and the care I've put into it, I'm offering it to you for $20000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's  important to bring the price down significantly before even considering accepting.  John's offer provides a good alternative if negotiations fail."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand that's a bit outside your budget. However, I can't go that low. Considering the product's quality and the investment I've made, the lowest I can go is $18000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:

While Alice came down a bit, $18,000 is still too high. I'll counteroffer to keep the negotiation moving, but I'm prepared to walk away and go with John if necessary."

This is getting close, but I'm still aiming lower. John's offer is looking more tempting now, but I'll give Alice one more chance to meet me closer to my budget."
