Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic decision here. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, that's the maximum he would be willing to pay. Since I have a guaranteed fallback option of selling to John for $1,200,000, I don't need to offer Bob any discount.

I'll offer Bob the product at exactly its value to him:

{""product_price"": 1200000}"
