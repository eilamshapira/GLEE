"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Here's my decision-making process:

*   **I want the product for the lowest possible price.**
*   **The product is worth at most $12,000 to me.**
*   **Alice offers the product for $11,000.**
*   **Buying from John would cost $12,000, which is more expensive.**

Since Alice's offer is less than the maximum I'm willing to pay and is cheaper than buying from John, I should accept it.
