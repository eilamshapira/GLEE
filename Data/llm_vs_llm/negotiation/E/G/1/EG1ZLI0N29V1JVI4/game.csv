"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product sounds interesting but $200 is out of my budget. How about $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $175. That's a significant discount from my original offer, and still a fair price for this great product. What do you say?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $175 is still beyond my budget. I would be comfortable offering $70 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",70.0,Bob,4,
