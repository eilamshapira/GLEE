Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think!,150.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify spending around $50. Would that work for you?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob! While $50 is a bit too low for me, how about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to offer you the product for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hmm, $100 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $65? That's a significant jump from my previous offer.",65.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your flexibility, Bob! I appreciate the offer of $65, but I'd like to propose a price that reflects the value of the product. How about $85? I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts!",85.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, I have a hard limit at $80 for this product.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to make the deal.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer of $80, Bob! While that's a good offer, I need to stay a bit higher to reflect the product's true value. How about we settle at $90? I think that would be a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,7,
