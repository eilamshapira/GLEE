Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer of $80, Bob! While that's a good offer, I need to stay a bit higher to reflect the product's true value. How about we settle at $90? I think that would be a fair price for both of us. What do you say?

Alice is unwilling to meet my maximum price, and continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better outcome. It's time to go with my alternative option."
