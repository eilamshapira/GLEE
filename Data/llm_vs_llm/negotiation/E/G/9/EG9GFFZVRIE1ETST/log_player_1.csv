Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $17,500. This is a fair price considering the quality and value of the product."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe the product is valuable, but the price of $17500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000, considering the product's quality and value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

The reason for my decision is that Bob's offer of $10,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Since I know I can sell to John for $15,000, and Bob's offer is significantly lower than that, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John rather than continue negotiating with Bob. Even if we continue negotiating, since the product is only worth $12,000 to Bob, it's unlikely he would ever offer more than $15,000."
