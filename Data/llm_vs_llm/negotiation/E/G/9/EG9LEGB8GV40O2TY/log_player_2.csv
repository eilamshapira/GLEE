"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'm looking at Alice's offer of $120 for the product. Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. The product is worth no more than $120 to me, which means $120 is my absolute maximum price.

Alice's current offer of $120 is the same price that John is offering. However, I can try to negotiate with Alice for a better price rather than immediately accepting or going to John.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has reduced her price from $120 to $115, which is progress in our negotiation. This offer is already better than John's fixed price of $120. However, since the product is worth $100 to Alice, I think there's still room to negotiate a slightly better price.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has come down to $112, which is a good improvement from her initial offer. She's showing willingness to negotiate, and this price is $8 less than John's fixed price of $120. While I could try to push for an even lower price, we're getting closer to a fair deal, and I don't want to risk too much back-and-forth that might frustrate Alice.
