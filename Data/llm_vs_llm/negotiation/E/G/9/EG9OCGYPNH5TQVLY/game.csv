"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you be willing to consider $750000?  I'm confident this is a fair price given its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thank you for your interest. While I appreciate your perspective, I'm not quite able to accept $750000. Considering the product's unique value and the potential it holds, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we meet at $950000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $950000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $850000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
