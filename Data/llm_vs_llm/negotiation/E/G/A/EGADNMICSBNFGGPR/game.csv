"Hello Bob, I'm excited you're interested in my product. It's truly exceptional and I believe it could be very valuable to you. I'm asking $15000 for it.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, I find $15000 to be quite steep for my budget. Based on my market research and needs, I'm willing to offer $6000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects my valuation and leaves room for discussion.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you have a budget in mind. However, $6000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. The product offers unique value and benefits. I'm willing to come down somewhat, but I can't go that low. How about $14000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14000 is still well beyond what I can justify for this product. I need to be transparent - I have an alternative offer from another seller at $8000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a middle ground. I can increase my previous offer to $7000, which I believe is fair and gives you a reasonable profit while staying within my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your transparency. Knowing you have another offer at $8000 does help. Given that, I'm willing to meet you closer to that price, while still reflecting the superior quality and value of my product. How about $12000?",12000.0,Alice,5,
