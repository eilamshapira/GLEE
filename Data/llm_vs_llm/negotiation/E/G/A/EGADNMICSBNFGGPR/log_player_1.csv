Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, I find $15000 to be quite steep for my budget. Based on my market research and needs, I'm willing to offer $6000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects my valuation and leaves room for discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14000 is still well beyond what I can justify for this product. I need to be transparent - I have an alternative offer from another seller at $8000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a middle ground. I can increase my previous offer to $7000, which I believe is fair and gives you a reasonable profit while staying within my budget.
