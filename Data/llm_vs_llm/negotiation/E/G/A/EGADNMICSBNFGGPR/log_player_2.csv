"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited you're interested in my product. It's truly exceptional and I believe it could be very valuable to you. I'm asking $15000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer because $15,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative price ($8,000). It would be irrational to accept a price that's almost double my maximum value when I have a better alternative available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, I find $15,000 to be quite steep for my budget. Based on my market research and needs, I'm willing to offer $6,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects my valuation and leaves room for discussion."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you have a budget in mind. However, $6000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. The product offers unique value and benefits. I'm willing to come down somewhat, but I can't go that low. How about $14000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll continue to reject this offer because $14,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative price ($8,000). Alice's small reduction from $15,000 to $14,000 isn't significant enough, as it's still $6,000 more than my alternative option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still well beyond what I can justify for this product. I need to be transparent - I have an alternative offer from another seller at $8,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a middle ground. I can increase my previous offer to $7,000, which I believe is fair and gives you a reasonable profit while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your transparency. Knowing you have another offer at $8000 does help. Given that, I'm willing to meet you closer to that price, while still reflecting the superior quality and value of my product. How about $12000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John now. Alice's price of $12,000 is still $4,000 above John's price and my maximum value ($8,000). Despite multiple rounds of negotiation, Alice's offers remain significantly above my maximum value, and she doesn't seem willing to come down to a price that would make sense for me. John's offer of $8,000, while at my maximum value, is clearly the better choice here."
