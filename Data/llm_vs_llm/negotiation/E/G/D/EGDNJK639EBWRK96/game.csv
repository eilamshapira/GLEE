"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value, but $12000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay a reasonable price, considering I can also buy it from John for $10000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for continuing the negotiation with me. I understand that we both want to find a fair price for the product. Considering your budget and my expectations, I'm willing to lower my offer to $10500. This way, we both make a small compromise, and you still get the product below the market value. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, since I can buy the product from John for $10000, I'd like to make a counteroffer that's more in line with that price. I'm willing to pay $10000, but I can stretch my budget a bit. Let's meet in the middle of your offer and John's price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
