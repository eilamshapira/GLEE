Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'd like to start the negotiation at a price that reflects its true value."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. Based on my budget and available alternatives, I'm prepared to offer $9000 for the product. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($8,000), but lower than my initial offer ($11,000), I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

My counteroffer will be $10,500, which is still lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while also trying to maximize my earnings.

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. Let me know if this price works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
