"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $140 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $140 might be a bit steep, but I think the product is worth more than $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price to $115. I'm getting closer to what I'm looking for, but I still think the product is worth a bit more. How about we meet at $120? I'm trying to be flexible here, and I think this price reflects the product's value fairly.",120.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. I'm willing to meet you at $117.50, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $115 and your current offer of $120. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",117.5,Bob,6,
