"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $140 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target price. $110 is still a bit low for me, and I think Bob might be willing to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $140 might be a bit steep, but I think the product is worth more than $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. While $115 is closer to my target price, I still think I can get a better deal. Since Bob is willing to negotiate and has increased his offer, I'll try to meet him closer to the middle of our previous offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price to $115. I'm getting closer to what I'm looking for, but I still think the product is worth a bit more. How about we meet at $120? I'm trying to be flexible here, and I think this price reflects the product's value fairly."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. I'm willing to meet you at $117.50, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $115 and your current offer of $120. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $117.50 is very close to my target price, and I think it's a fair compromise. Given that we're running out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal, I'm willing to accept this price. It's still above my minimum of $100, and I believe it's a good outcome for both of us."
