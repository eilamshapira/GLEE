"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm offering it to you for a price of $12000. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $12,000
2. John is also selling it for $12,000
3. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
4. If I reject Alice's offer, I can make a counteroffer that might result in a lower price

Since Alice's price is the same as John's, and I can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice, I should reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice, starting significantly lower to leave room for negotiation:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12,000 is quite high for me, especially since I can find similar products elsewhere. I value this product at $8,500. Would you be willing to sell it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

This counteroffer makes sense because:
1. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, giving room for negotiation
2. It's reasonable enough to not offend Alice
3. If Alice accepts, I'll save $3,500
4. If Alice counters, we can still negotiate to a price below $12,000
5. I always have John's $12,000 offer as a backup"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price. This product is truly unique and offers exceptional value. How about we meet in the middle at $10000? I believe this price reflects the quality and uniqueness of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","This is a good development:

1. Alice has reduced her price significantly from $12,000 to $10,000
2. This is already $2,000 less than both her initial offer and John's price
3. While we might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might become less flexible if we push too hard
4. $10,000 represents a meaningful savings over my maximum price of $12,000

Given that we've already achieved a significant reduction and secured a $2,000 savings compared to John's price, I think it's wise to accept this offer. Further negotiation might risk losing this good deal.
