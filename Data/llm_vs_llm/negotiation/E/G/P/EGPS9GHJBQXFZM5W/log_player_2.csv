"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth a premium price, and I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'll analyze the situation:
1. Alice is offering the product for $120
2. The product is worth no more than $80 to me
3. John is willing to sell it for $80
4. Alice's initial offer is significantly above both my maximum value and John's price

Since Alice's offer ($120) is well above both my maximum value ($80) and John's alternative price ($80), it would not be rational to accept it. While I could make a counteroffer, I already know that John's price matches my maximum value, and Alice's opening high price suggests significant negotiation might be needed to reach an acceptable price.
