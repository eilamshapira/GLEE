"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $10,000, but the product is only worth $8,000 to me, so accepting this offer would result in me losing money.

I could make a counteroffer to Alice, but since she values the product at $8,000, she likely won't accept anything significantly below that amount.

The third option is to buy from John for $8,000, which exactly matches my maximum value for the product.

Given these considerations, I should either make a counteroffer to Alice or buy from John. Since John's price already matches my maximum value, and there's uncertainty about whether negotiating with Alice will lead to a better deal, the rational choice is:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
