Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Anchoring High:** I'm starting significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and even above my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This is a negotiation tactic to ""anchor"" the discussion at a higher price point.
*   **Exploring Bob's Willingness:** This initial offer is a test to gauge Bob's genuine interest and how far he's willing to negotiate. If he immediately rejects it, I'll learn that his $800,000 valuation is firm.
*   **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, I create room to make concessions later, which can make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, even if the final price is still favorable to me.
*   **Keeping John in Mind:** I am comfortable losing Bob's offer because I have John as backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and even his own perceived value of the product ($800,000). This indicates that he is either trying to exploit the situation or severely undervalues the product. It's unlikely that further negotiation will lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. Given that I have a guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 from John, it is the most rational decision to sell to him and avoid wasting time on further unproductive negotiation with Bob."
