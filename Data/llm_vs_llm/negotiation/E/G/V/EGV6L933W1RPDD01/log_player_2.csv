"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000. It wouldn't make any economic sense to accept this offer when I can buy the same product from John for $800,000. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a more reasonable price. If negotiations don't work out, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'm offering $700,000, which is below John's price of $800,000. This gives room for negotiation while still being potentially profitable for Alice (since she values the product at $1,200,000). Even if Alice counters with a higher price, I still have the option to go with John's offer of $800,000 if we can't reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
