"Bob, $40 is much too low. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I can't go that low. How about $220?",220.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $220 is still much higher than what I'm looking to spend. I'll raise my offer to $50. Let's try to find some middle ground.",50.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we are quite far apart. I am willing to come down a bit more, but $50 is still too low. My bottom line is closer to $200. Let's meet in the middle at $185?",185.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $185 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $60, but that's really the highest I can go.",60.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here. $60 is significantly below what I can accept. How about we try $165?",165.0,Alice,7,
