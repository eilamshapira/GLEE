"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to present you with an incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm offering it to you for $15000. Let me know if you have any questions or if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is $5,000 more than the product is worth to me (maximum $10,000), and John is offering the same product for exactly $10,000, I should not accept Alice's current offer.

I have two remaining options: I can either reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, or simply buy from John immediately. Since John's price is exactly at my maximum valuation, there's no guarantee I can get a better deal from Alice through negotiation. The safe choice would be to buy from John.
