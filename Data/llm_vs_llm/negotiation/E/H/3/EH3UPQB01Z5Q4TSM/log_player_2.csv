"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's offer is $8,000, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and buying from John would also cost me $8,000, I might as well accept Alice's offer to avoid any potential hassle or difference in the product or service.
