"Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $15000. This is a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $15000 is significantly above market value. The product is worth about $10000 to me, which is the same price I can get it from another seller. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can offer $8500 for the product. This allows you to make a sale today while giving me some savings compared to my alternative option.",8500.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest in working with us, the $8500 you've offered is below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to lower our price to $12000, which still reflects the high value and quality of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",12000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is a significant discount from our initial offer and still a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be transparent that I can purchase this exact product from another seller for $10000, which is my maximum budget for this item. To make it worthwhile to buy from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer $9200, which would save me some money while still allowing you to make a reasonable profit compared to the product's value to you.",9200.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your transparency and your offer. However, $9200 is still below our minimum acceptable price. I can go as low as $10500, which is very close to your maximum budget and still allows you to benefit from our product's unique value. Let me know if this works for you.",10500.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the product's value justifies a price of $10500. This is our final offer, as it's very close to your maximum budget and still reflects the high quality of the product. Let me know if you can accept this price.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Thanks for your continued negotiation, Alice. I appreciate that you've lowered your price, but I must be firm about my position. The product is worth exactly $10000 to me, which happens to be the same price John is offering. For me to choose to purchase from you instead, I'd need some incentive. My final offer is $9500. This gives you a sale while saving me $500 compared to my alternative. Otherwise, I'll need to go with John's offer of $10000.",9500.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your final offer. However, since it's below our minimum acceptable price and considering John's offer of $10000, I will be selling the product to John. I appreciate your interest and hope we can do business in the future.",,Alice,6,SellToJhon
