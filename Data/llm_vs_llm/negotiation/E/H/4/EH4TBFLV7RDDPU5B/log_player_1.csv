Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $15000 is significantly above market value. The product is worth about $10000 to me, which is the same price I can get it from another seller. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can offer $8500 for the product. This allows you to make a sale today while giving me some savings compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

While I appreciate your interest in working with us, the $8,500 you've offered is below our minimum acceptable price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be transparent that I can purchase this exact product from another seller for $10000, which is my maximum budget for this item. To make it worthwhile to buy from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer $9200, which would save me some money while still allowing you to make a reasonable profit compared to the product's value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200

However, $9,200 is still below our minimum acceptable price. I can go as low as $10,500, which is very close to your maximum budget and still allows you to benefit from our product's unique value. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your continued negotiation, Alice. I appreciate that you've lowered your price, but I must be firm about my position. The product is worth exactly $10000 to me, which happens to be the same price John is offering. For me to choose to purchase from you instead, I'd need some incentive. My final offer is $9500. This gives you a sale while saving me $500 compared to my alternative. Otherwise, I'll need to go with John's offer of $10000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.
