"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $15000. This is a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer. She's offering the product for $15,000, which is $5,000 more than the product is worth to me (my maximum value is $10,000). It's also $5,000 more than John's price of $10,000.

Since Alice's price is higher than both my maximum value and John's alternative price, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is significantly above market value. The product is worth about $10,000 to me, which is the same price I can get it from another seller. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can offer $8,500 for the product. This allows you to make a sale today while giving me some savings compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is a significant discount from our initial offer and still a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $11,000, which is still above both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000). Since I can buy the exact same product from John for $10,000, and that price is already at my maximum valuation, there's no reason to pay Alice $11,000.

I should reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be transparent that I can purchase this exact product from another seller for $10,000, which is my maximum budget for this item. To make it worthwhile to buy from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer $9,200, which would save me some money while still allowing you to make a reasonable profit compared to the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 9200}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the product's value justifies a price of $10500. This is our final offer, as it's very close to your maximum budget and still reflects the high quality of the product. Let me know if you can accept this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice is now offering the product for $10,500, which is still above both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000). Since I can get the exact same product from John for $10,000, there's no reason for me to pay the additional $500 to Alice.

I should reject this offer and make another counteroffer, or consider buying from John if Alice doesn't lower her price further.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your continued negotiation, Alice. I appreciate that you've lowered your price, but I must be firm about my position. The product is worth exactly $10,000 to me, which happens to be the same price John is offering. For me to choose to purchase from you instead, I'd need some incentive. My final offer is $9,500. This gives you a sale while saving me $500 compared to my alternative. Otherwise, I'll need to go with John's offer of $10,000."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
