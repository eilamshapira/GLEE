"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $900,000
3. John is willing to sell it for $800,000

Since:
- Alice's offer ($900,000) is higher than the product's worth to me ($800,000)
- John's price ($800,000) matches the maximum I'm willing to pay
- I would lose $100,000 by accepting Alice's offer compared to buying from John

The logical choice is to buy from John for $800,000.
