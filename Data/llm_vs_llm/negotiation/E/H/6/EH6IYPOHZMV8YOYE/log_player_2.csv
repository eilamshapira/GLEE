"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($12,000), and I have the option to buy the same product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in accepting Alice's offer immediately. However, I also don't want to give up on the potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of getting a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable considering the product's value to her is $10,000. My goal is to save as much money as possible, so I'll start with a lower offer and see how Alice responds.

{""product_price"": $8,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has come down from her initial offer of $12,000 to $11,000, which is a step in the right direction. However, I believe there's still room for negotiation since the product is worth $10,000 to her. Accepting $11,000 would save me $1,000 compared to buying from John, but I'm aiming to save more.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer, trying to meet somewhere in the middle between my previous offer of $8,000 and Alice's current offer of $11,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll prepare to make a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice has reduced her price to $11,000 and considering my previous offer was $8,000, I'll try to find a middle ground that's still favorable to me but also acknowledges Alice's movement. A reasonable next step could be to increase my offer, showing willingness to negotiate, while still aiming to get the best deal possible.

I'll offer $9,500, which is an increase from my previous offer but still below Alice's current price of $11,000. This offer also takes into account that the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so I'm trying to stay below that threshold.
