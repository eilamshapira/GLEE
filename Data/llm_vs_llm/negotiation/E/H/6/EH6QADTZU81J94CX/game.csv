"Thanks for your offer, Alice, but $18000 is a bit beyond my budget. Iâ€™d like to make a counteroffer of $10000 for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it still represents a great value for you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",15000.0,Alice,3,
