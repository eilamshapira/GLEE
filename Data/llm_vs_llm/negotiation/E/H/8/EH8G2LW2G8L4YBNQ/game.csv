"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair offer.",200.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm looking to spend no more than $100. Can we start at $50?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $50 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down, but I need to get a fair price for the product. Let's meet in the middle.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, Alice. However, $150 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Can we try $75 instead?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your revised offer, Bob. I see you're willing to increase your price, and I appreciate that. However, $75 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least closer to my initial offer. How about we try $140?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you need to get a fair price, but $140 is still too high for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $90?",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your patience, Bob. I see we're getting closer, but I still need to get a bit more for the product. Considering your offer of $90 and my previous offer of $140, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $115. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",115.0,Alice,7,
