"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm looking to spend no more than $100. Can we start at $50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $50 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob or sell it to John for $120 if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $50 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down, but I need to get a fair price for the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, Alice. However, $150 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Can we try $75 instead? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Although Bob is increasing his offer, $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your revised offer, Bob. I see you're willing to increase your price, and I appreciate that.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you need to get a fair price, but $140 is still too high for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $90?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Bob is getting closer to a price that I might be willing to accept, but $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my previous counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your patience, Bob. I see we're getting closer, but I still need to get a bit more for the product. Considering your offer of $90 and my previous offer of $140, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $115. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 115}"
