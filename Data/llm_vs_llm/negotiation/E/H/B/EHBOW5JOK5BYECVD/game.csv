"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $5000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $5000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to offer a compromise at $18000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18000 is still too high for me. I can stretch my budget a bit more and offer $6000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $6000. I appreciate your willingness to increase your budget. However, I still believe the product's value is higher. I'm willing to make a significant concession and offer the product to you for $15000. This is a more reasonable price, considering the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $15000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your continued efforts to find a mutually acceptable price. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $7000. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $12000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value and the fact that I have other interested buyers. If you're serious about acquiring the product, I hope you'll consider this offer seriously.",12000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to lower the price, but $12000 is still a bit high for me. I can go up to $8000. I hope this is something we can work with.",8000.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $8000. I appreciate your efforts to increase your budget. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.

"Hi Alice, I understand this is getting close to your bottom line, but $11000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000 as my final offer. If this works for you, we can close the deal. If not, I might have to consider other options.",9000.0,Bob,10,
