Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $5000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $5,000 because it's significantly lower than my initial offer and below my minimum acceptable price. I'd like to make a counteroffer to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle. 

My counteroffer is: $18,000 

Let's proceed to the next round and see how Bob responds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18000 is still too high for me. I can stretch my budget a bit more and offer $6000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

I reject Bob's offer of $6,000 because it's still below my target price. Although he's increasing his offer, it's not enough to meet my expectations. I'd like to make another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to a mutually acceptable price.

My next counteroffer will be: $15,000 

This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I hope Bob will consider it seriously. If not, I may need to think about selling to John for $10,000."

I reject Bob's offer of $7,000 because it's still below my minimum acceptable price. Although he's increasing his offer, the gap between his offer and my target price is still significant.

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I also need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. If Bob is not willing to meet me at this price, I may need to consider selling to John for $10,000, which is still a better option than selling to Bob for $7,000."

I decide to sell the product to John for $10,000. Although Bob's final offer of $9,000 is close, it's still below the price that John is willing to pay. Since this is the final round, I don't have the opportunity to make another counteroffer, and I don't want to accept a lower price than what John is offering. Selling to John guarantees me a higher price, and I'm confident that it's the best decision for me."
