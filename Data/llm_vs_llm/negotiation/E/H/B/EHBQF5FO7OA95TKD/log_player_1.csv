Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about a strategic price for this offer.

Since the product is worth at least $12,000 to me and I have John as a guaranteed backup buyer at $12,000, I should offer Bob a price higher than $12,000 to potentially maximize my profit. If Bob rejects, I don't lose anything as I can still sell to John.

I'll set a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but not so high that it would immediately discourage Bob.
