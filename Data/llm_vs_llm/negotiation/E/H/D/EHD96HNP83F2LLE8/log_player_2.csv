(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but we can likely do better. We are still in the early rounds and have time to negotiate."

{""product_price"": 1075000}
