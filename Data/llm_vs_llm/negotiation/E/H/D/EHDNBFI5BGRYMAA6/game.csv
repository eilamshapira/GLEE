"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm definitely interested in the product, $1800000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1200000.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your offer of $1200000, but I can't go that low. How about we settle on $1650000? I believe this is a fair price for such a valuable product. Looking forward to your response!",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I'm still a little ways off from that number.  I could meet you at $1350000.  This is a significant investment for me, so I'd appreciate it if you could consider my offer.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. Your offer of $1350000 is getting closer, but I can’t quite accept it yet. How about we meet halfway at $1550000? I think this is a reasonable price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm trying to make this work, but $1550000 is still pushing it.  My absolute best offer is $1425000. If we can agree on this, I'm ready to close the deal. If not, I’ll have to go with my alternative option.",1425000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I understand your position, but $1425000 is still a bit lower than I can accept. How about we settle on $1475000? This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. Looking forward to your response!",1475000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm really at my limit.  I can offer $1450000, and that's the absolute best I can do.  If you can't accept that, I'll unfortunately have to go with John's offer.",1450000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. Your offer of $1450000 is close, but I’m still looking for a little more. How about we agree on $1460000? I think this could be a win-win for both of us. Let me know what you think!",1460000.0,Alice,9,
