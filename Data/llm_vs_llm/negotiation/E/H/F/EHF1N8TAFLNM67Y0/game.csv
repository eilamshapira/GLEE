"Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2500000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential returns.",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $600000 for the product, considering its potential value to me. Let me know if this works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600000 is far below the product's true value. I have another buyer willing to pay $1500000, which represents the minimum price I can accept. However, I believe this product could be more valuable to you, so I'm willing to offer it at $1800000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1800000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000, which is the maximum I can go. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
