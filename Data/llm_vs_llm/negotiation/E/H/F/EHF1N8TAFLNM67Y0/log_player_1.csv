"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,500,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential returns."", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $600000 for the product, considering its potential value to me. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I should make a counteroffer in the next round, but if we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far below the product's true value. I have another buyer willing to pay $1,500,000, which represents the minimum price I can accept. However, I believe this product could be more valuable to you, so I'm willing to offer it at $1,800,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1800000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000, which is the maximum I can go. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's maximum offer of $700,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and he's indicated this is the maximum he can go, it's best to sell to John for $1,500,000 rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to reach an acceptable price."
