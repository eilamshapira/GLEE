Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $50. I believe this is a fair price, considering I can also buy it from John for $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually agreeable price. Since Bob mentioned he can buy it from John for $80, I'll try to meet him halfway between my initial offer and John's price. 

My counteroffer: $150"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Since I know I can get it from John for $80, I'd like to propose a price that's closer to that. How about we meet at $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since he's still referencing John's price of $80, I'll try to get closer to that, but I'm not willing to go as low as $65. I'll aim for a price that's higher than John's, but still reasonable.

My counteroffer: $100"
