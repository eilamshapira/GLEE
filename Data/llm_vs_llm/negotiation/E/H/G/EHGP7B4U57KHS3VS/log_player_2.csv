Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $50 is too low for me. Considering you mentioned John's price of $80, I'm willing to compromise. However, I still believe my product is worth more than that. Let's try to meet in the middle.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $65 is still a bit too low for me. I understand that John's price of $80 is a factor, but I believe my product has more value than that. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get at least $100 for it. Let's see if we can meet at this price.
