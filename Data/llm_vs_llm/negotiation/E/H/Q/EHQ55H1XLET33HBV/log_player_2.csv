"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","The offer from Alice is $170, which is higher than the product's worth to me ($80). It's also higher than the alternative offer from John of $80. Since I can buy the product from John for $80, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that acknowledges Alice's costs while also trying to find a middle ground that works for me.

{""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has dropped her price from $170 to $160, but this is still double what I'm willing to pay for the product, as it's worth no more than $80 to me. Since John is willing to sell me the same product for $80, which is the maximum value I place on it, there's no reason to continue negotiating at this high price point.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer of $155 is still significantly higher than the product's worth to me ($80) and higher than John's offer ($80). Since we've been through several rounds of negotiation and Alice's price remains well above my maximum value for the product, it makes sense to go with the readily available option from John.
