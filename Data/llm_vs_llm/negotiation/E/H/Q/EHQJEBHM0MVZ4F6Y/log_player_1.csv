Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($800,000) but lower than the price I initially offered ($1,400,000), I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be $1,200,000, which is lower than my initial offer but still closer to the value Bob has for the product ($1,500,000).

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer of $1,200,000.
