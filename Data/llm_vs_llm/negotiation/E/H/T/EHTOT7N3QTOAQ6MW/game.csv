"Hello Alice, thanks for presenting your product. While it sounds interesting, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to offer $5000 for it.",5000.0,Bob,2,
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $5000 is far too low for this product's value. I can offer it to you for $17500, which is a significant reduction from my initial price.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $5000 is far too low for this product's value. I can offer it to you for $17500, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, while I appreciate your increased offer, $7000 is still significantly below the product's value. Let me meet you partway - I can offer it for $15000. This represents a substantial discount from my initial asking price.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $15000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but that's my absolute limit.",9000.0,Bob,6,
"I'm sorry Bob, but I cannot accept $9000 for this product as it's significantly below its value. I have another buyer who is willing to pay a price that better reflects the product's worth. Thank you for your interest and negotiations, but I'll have to end our discussion here.",,Alice,6,SellToJhon
