"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for presenting your product. While it sounds interesting, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to offer $5,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $5000 is far too low for this product's value. I can offer it to you for $17500, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
We're making progress, but still nowhere near our target price. Let's see if we can bring Alice down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

I'm pushing closer to my limit here, but I want to see if Alice is willing to make a larger move towards a more reasonable price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your increased offer, $7000 is still significantly below the product's value. Let me meet you partway - I can offer it for $15000. This represents a substantial discount from my initial asking price and reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice is getting closer, but we still have room to negotiate. I want to see if I can get her below $10,000 before considering John's offer more seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $15,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute limit."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This offer is slightly above my ideal price, but I need to signal to Alice that I'm serious and have a firm budget in mind."
