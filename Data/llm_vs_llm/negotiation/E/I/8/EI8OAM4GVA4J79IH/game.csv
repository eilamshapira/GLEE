"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1800000 is significantly above my budget. I know the market well, and I can actually get this product elsewhere for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $1200000 for the product? This would be a fair price that works within my budget while still providing good value for both parties.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. While I understand budget constraints, $1200000 is actually my absolute minimum floor price - it's what I could sell this product for immediately to another buyer. Given the product's quality and market value, I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer. I can offer it to you at $1600000, which represents a substantial discount from my original price while better reflecting its true value. This is still well below the $1800000 that similar products command in the current market.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
