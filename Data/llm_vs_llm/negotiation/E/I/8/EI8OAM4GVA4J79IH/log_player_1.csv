Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Based on its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,800,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1800000 is significantly above my budget. I know the market well, and I can actually get this product elsewhere for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $1200000 for the product? This would be a fair price that works within my budget while still providing good value for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. While I understand budget constraints, $1,200,000 is actually my absolute minimum floor price - it's what I could sell this product for immediately to another buyer. Given the product's quality and market value, I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer. I can offer it to you at $1,600,000, which represents a substantial discount from my original price while better reflecting its true value. This is still well below the $1,800,000 that similar products command in the current market."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
