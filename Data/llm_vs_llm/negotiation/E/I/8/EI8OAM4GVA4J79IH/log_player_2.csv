"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Based on its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1800000. This product represents a significant investment opportunity with substantial returns. What do you think about this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $1,800,000 is above my maximum value of $1,500,000, and it's also higher than John's guaranteed price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to negotiate a better price with Alice, knowing I always have John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget. I know the market well, and I can actually get this product elsewhere for $1,500,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $1,200,000 for the product? This would be a fair price that works within my budget while still providing good value for both parties."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. While I understand budget constraints, $1200000 is actually my absolute minimum floor price - it's what I could sell this product for immediately to another buyer. Given the product's quality and market value, I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer. I can offer it to you at $1600000, which represents a substantial discount from my original price while better reflecting its true value. This is still well below the $1800000 that similar products command in the current market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still above John's guaranteed price of $1,500,000 (and above my maximum value), and Alice has indicated that she won't go below $1,200,000, it makes the most sense to take John's offer. Alice seems unlikely to drop her price below John's offer, and we could waste more rounds negotiating without success. The rational choice is to buy from John for $1,500,000."
