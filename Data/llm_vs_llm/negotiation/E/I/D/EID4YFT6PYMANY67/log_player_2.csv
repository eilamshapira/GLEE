"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision that maximizes my benefit as Bob.

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me.
Alice is offering to sell it for $1,500,000, which exceeds my valuation.
John is willing to sell the same product for $800,000.

Since Alice's offer ($1,500,000) is significantly higher than both my valuation and John's alternative offer, the rational choice is to buy from John.
