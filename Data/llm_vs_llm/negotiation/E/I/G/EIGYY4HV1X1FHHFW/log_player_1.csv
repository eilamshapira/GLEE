"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its market value and quality, I'm offering it at $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $950000 is above my budget. I am willing to offer $700000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $700,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and even below John's guaranteed offer, I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll try to negotiate for a better price, knowing I always have John's $800,000 offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $700,000 is significantly below the product's value. I should mention that I have another interested buyer willing to pay $800,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you. I can reduce my initial asking price to $875,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 875000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you considering my offer. While I understand the product's value to you, my budget is firm. I can offer $750000. I'm also considering another offer at $800000, so let me know if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll take John's guaranteed offer of $800,000. Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and he's mentioned he has another option at $800,000, suggesting he's unlikely to raise his offer significantly. Given we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation without getting close to my target price, and Bob seems firm on his budget, it's best to take the sure deal with John that meets my minimum price requirement."
