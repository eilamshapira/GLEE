"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer, considering the product is worth $120 to Bob and $80 to me. This gives room for negotiation while potentially maximizing my profit.

{""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's only slightly better than John's standing offer. Given that we're only in round 2 and Bob values the product at $120, I believe there's room to negotiate for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still maintain a price that would give me a good profit, considering Bob values the product at $120.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob has increased his offer to $90, which is better than his previous offer of $85. While this is a decent improvement and gives me $10 more than John's offer, we're only in round 4 of 10, and there might still be room for negotiation since Bob values the product at $120.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 5
