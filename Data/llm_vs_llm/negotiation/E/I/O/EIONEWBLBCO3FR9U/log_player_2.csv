"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $20,000 against my alternatives.

The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, so paying $20,000 would mean I'm losing at least $5,000 in value. Additionally, John is offering the same product for $15,000, which is a strictly better option than Alice's current offer.

While I could make a counteroffer to Alice, there's no reason to pay more than $15,000 for this product since that's both my maximum valuation and John's asking price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since John is willing to sell me the product for $15,000 and that's my maximum valuation, I'll make a counteroffer to Alice that's below that amount to try to get a better deal.
