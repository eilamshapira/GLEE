"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,200,000, it would be unwise to accept it. Buying from John for $1,200,000 is an option, but I'd like to try and negotiate a better price with Alice first. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of finding a mutually agreeable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range, considering my maximum budget is $1,200,000. A good starting point could be around $900,000, which gives room for negotiation while also being serious about purchasing the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,500,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. While it's a reduction from her initial offer, it doesn't meet my budget constraint. Since buying from John for $1,200,000 is still an option and aligns with my budget, I could consider that. However, I'd like to continue negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

Given that Alice has already reduced her price once, it indicates she is willing to negotiate. I'll reject her current offer and make another counteroffer, trying to bring the price closer to my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice reduced her price from $1,800,000 to $1,500,000, showing a willingness to negotiate, my next counteroffer should be reasonable and encourage further negotiation. Considering my maximum budget is $1,200,000, I'll aim for a price that's slightly higher than my previous offer of $900,000 but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer of $1,500,000. A counteroffer of $1,100,000 seems like a fair step, as it moves closer to Alice's offer while still being below my budget.
