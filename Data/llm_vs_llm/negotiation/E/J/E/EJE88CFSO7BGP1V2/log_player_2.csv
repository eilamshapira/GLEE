"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for a competitive price. If you're interested, please let me know. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $149. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $149
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth $100 to me (maximum I value it)
2. Alice is offering it for $149
3. John is willing to sell it for $100

Since Alice's offer ($149) is well above my maximum valuation ($100), and John is offering exactly at my maximum valuation ($100), it makes the most sense to buy from John.
