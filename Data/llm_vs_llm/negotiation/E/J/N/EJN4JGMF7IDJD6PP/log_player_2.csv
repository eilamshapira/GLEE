"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer is $120, which is the same price as John's offer, and it's also my maximum value for the product, there's no advantage in negotiating further. Making a counteroffer would likely waste time, and I can't get a better deal since $120 is my maximum value.

However, since both Alice and John are offering the same price, I might as well accept Alice's offer directly since we're already in negotiation with her.
