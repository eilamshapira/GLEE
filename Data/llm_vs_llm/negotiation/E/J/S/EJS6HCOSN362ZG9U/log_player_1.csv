Send your offer to Bob.,"Based on the information provided, I should make a strategic decision about how to price the product when offering it to Bob.

Since the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, that's the absolute maximum he would be willing to pay. If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell to John for $1,200,000, which is guaranteed and matches my minimum acceptable value.

Given that Bob won't pay more than the product's value to him ($800,000), and I have a guaranteed alternative of $1,200,000 from John, the rational choice is to proceed with selling to John.

However, the instructions require me to make an offer to Bob. Since Bob will reject any offer above $800,000, and any offer at or below $800,000 would result in less money than my guaranteed alternative with John, I should set a price that ensures Bob will decline.
