,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer of $100, but I can't go that low. The product's quality and value are quite high. However, I can come down to $110, which I believe is a fair price for what you're getting. Would that work for you?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice. Thank you for coming down a bit. I'm still trying to manage my budget, so would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and understand your budget concerns. However, $90 is still a bit too low for me given the value of this product. I can offer you $105, which is a significant discount from my initial price. This is really the best I can do while still making this worthwhile for me. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
