"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Based on the given information, I should evaluate Alice's offer and decide what's the best choice for me (Bob).

Alice offers to sell the product for $15,000, but I know that:
1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
2. John is willing to sell me the same product for $8,000

Since Alice's offer ($15,000) exceeds both my maximum valuation ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000), the rational decision is to buy from John instead of accepting Alice's offer.
