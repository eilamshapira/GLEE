Send your offer to Bob.,"Analyzing the situation:

- The product is worth $800,000 to me (Alice)
- The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob
- If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for $800,000 guaranteed
- I want to maximize my profit

Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, he would theoretically be willing to pay up to that amount. However, he'll likely want to retain some of that value for himself. If I price too high, Bob might reject the offer, and I'd only get $800,000 from John.

A strategic approach would be to offer Bob a price that gives him enough incentive to accept while still maximizing my profit. A price around $1,200,000 would give Bob $300,000 in value while giving me a significant premium over my minimum acceptable amount.
