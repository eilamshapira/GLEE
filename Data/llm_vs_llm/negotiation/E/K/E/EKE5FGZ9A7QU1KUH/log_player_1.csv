Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and the product's worth to me, I will reject his offer. I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob or stick with the option to sell to John for $12,000 if necessary.

My counteroffer will be $11,000, trying to meet Bob closer to my minimum while leaving some room for further negotiation.

My next counteroffer will be $10,500, aiming to find a middle ground while ensuring I don't go below my acceptable limit.

Given that Bob's offers have been increasing, I might try one more time to see if he can meet me at a more reasonable price. However, I will also consider the risk of not selling the product to Bob and the certainty of selling it to John for $12,000.

My next counteroffer will be $9,000, trying to find a compromise while being mindful of the time constraint and the alternative option with John.
