"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $130 seems a bit high. Given the market value and similar products I've seen, I would be comfortable paying $95 for it. This would still give you a good profit margin while being a fair price for me. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $95 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,
