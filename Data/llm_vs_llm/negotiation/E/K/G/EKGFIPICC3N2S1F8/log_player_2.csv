"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $130. It's a great deal considering its value! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $130
2. The product is worth no more than $150 to me
3. I know Alice's cost is $80, so there's room for negotiation
4. John's offer of $150 is my fallback option, but it's the highest price

While $130 is better than John's price of $150, I believe there's room to negotiate with Alice since her cost is $80. I should try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's above Alice's cost but significantly below her initial offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $130 seems a bit high. Given the market value and similar products I've seen, I would be comfortable paying $95 for it. This would still give you a good profit margin while being a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $95 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the new situation:

1. Alice has lowered her price from $130 to $115
2. This is a significant reduction from her initial offer
3. It's $35 less than John's price of $150
4. While there might be room for a bit more negotiation, $115 is a reasonable price
5. There's a risk that if I push too hard, Alice might increase her price again

Given that $115 is substantially below my maximum value of $150 and represents a fair compromise between her initial $130 and my $95 offer, I should accept this offer.
