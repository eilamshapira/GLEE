"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to evaluate Alice's offer against my alternatives.

Alice is offering the product for $110. If I reject this offer, I'll have to buy from John for $120. 

Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and Alice's offer ($110) is less than John's price ($120), accepting Alice's offer would save me $10.
