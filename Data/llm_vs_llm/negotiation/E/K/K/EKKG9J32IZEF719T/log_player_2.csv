"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $14,000, which is significantly above my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $8,000, which matches my maximum value

The rational decision is to buy from John. Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is way too high compared to both my maximum value and John's alternative offer. Even if I make a counteroffer, it's unlikely that Alice will lower the price enough (below $8,000) given that the product is worth $15,000 to her.
