"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while aiming to maximize my profit.

{""product_price"": 1,450,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","While Bob's offer of $1,350,000 provides a good profit margin and is significantly higher than John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation. The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still aim for a price that gives me a strong profit, considering Bob values the product at $1,500,000.

{""product_price"": 1,400,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob is standing firm at $1,350,000, repeating his previous offer. Given that:
1. We're now in round 4 out of 10
2. The $1,350,000 offer is significantly better than John's $1,200,000
3. Bob seems unwilling to move higher than $1,350,000
4. There's a risk Bob might lower his offer if negotiations continue

It's prudent to accept this offer now. The $1,350,000 represents a good profit, being $150,000 above my minimum acceptable price.
