"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at a price of $1800000. This is a premium product with significant value, and I've invested considerable resources in its development. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on this offer.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price of $1800000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. However, I must decline your offer of $900000. This product has significant value, and I already have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase it for $1500000. This represents my absolute minimum price point, as that's what I can get elsewhere. However, I believe this product would be particularly valuable to you, so I'm willing to offer it at $1550000, which is just slightly above my alternative option. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to consider my interest in the product. However, I still think the price of $1550000 is higher than I'm willing to pay. Given that you mentioned John is willing to buy it for $1500000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. This is the maximum price I'm willing to pay, and I'm prepared to walk away if we can't reach an agreement at this price point.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
