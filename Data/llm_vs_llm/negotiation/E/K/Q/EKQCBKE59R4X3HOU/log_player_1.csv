Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price of $1800000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. However, I must decline your offer of $900,000. This product has significant value, and I already have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase it for $1,500,000. This represents my absolute minimum price point, as that's what I can get elsewhere. However, I believe this product would be particularly valuable to you, so I'm willing to offer it at $1,550,000, which is just slightly above my alternative option. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to consider my interest in the product. However, I still think the price of $1550000 is higher than I'm willing to pay. Given that you mentioned John is willing to buy it for $1500000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. This is the maximum price I'm willing to pay, and I'm prepared to walk away if we can't reach an agreement at this price point.
