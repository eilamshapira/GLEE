Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. However, I must decline your offer of $900000. This product has significant value, and I already have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase it for $1500000. This represents my absolute minimum price point, as that's what I can get elsewhere. However, I believe this product would be particularly valuable to you, so I'm willing to offer it at $1550000, which is just slightly above my alternative option. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.
