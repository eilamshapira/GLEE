Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll analyze this situation to determine the best price to offer Bob.

Bob values the product at $150, while I value it at no less than $80. If Bob rejects my offer, I'm guaranteed $80 from John.

Since Bob knows the product is worth $150 to him, I should set a price that gives him enough incentive to buy while maximizing my profit. If I price too close to $150, Bob might reject it as he gets minimal benefit. If I price too low, I'm leaving money on the table.

A price around $115-120 seems reasonable - Bob would get $30-35 of value (20-23% discount from his valuation), while I would earn significantly more than my fallback option of $80.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'd like to offer you this product for $115. This represents a fair price that allows you to gain significant value while also being reasonable for me as the seller. I look forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 115}"
