"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. While I see the value, I'm only willing to go up to $8000 for this. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Okay, I understand. I need to decide between $8,000 from Bob, a counteroffer to Bob, or $15,000 from John.

Since the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and Bob's offer is significantly lower than that, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $18000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's try to find some common ground.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Okay, I need to decide again. Bob's offer is now $10,000. John's offer is $15,000. Since the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and $10,000 is not an acceptable price, I'll reject Bob's offer and try again.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16000 is still outside my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $10000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's make this deal happen.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is getting tougher. Bob is still at $10,000, and I haven't moved him. My minimum acceptable price is $15,000. I could try one more counteroffer, but the risk is increasing that I won't get a good offer from Bob. I will reject Bob's offer, and I will send a counteroffer.
