"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product and I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start by making a high offer. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially settle on a higher price than if I started with a lower offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and also lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,200,000), and I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate, I will reject Bob's offer.

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer, in an attempt to meet Bob somewhere in the middle and maximize my earnings.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $500,000 and my initial offer was $2,500,000, I'll try to find a middle ground while still being mindful of my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial offer but still reflects the value I believe the product holds.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's new offer of $650,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Since I have 6 rounds left to negotiate and Bob has increased his offer from $500,000 to $650,000, it indicates that he is willing to pay more for the product. However, the increase is not significant enough for me to consider accepting it, given the product's value to me.

I will reject Bob's offer again and proceed to the next round with a new counteroffer that is lower than my previous one but still above my minimum acceptable price, hoping to encourage Bob to meet me at a higher price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Given that Bob has increased his offer to $650,000, I will decrease my counteroffer from $2,000,000 to a price that is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 but closer to Bob's offer, in an attempt to find a mutually agreeable price.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer has increased to $700,000, but it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. With 4 rounds left to negotiate, I'm starting to consider the certainty of selling to John for $1,200,000 as a more attractive option, especially since Bob's increases are gradual and not closing the gap quickly enough.

However, I'll give the negotiation one more chance to see if Bob is willing to make a more substantial move towards my minimum price. If not, selling to John will be the better choice.

For now, I'll reject Bob's offer and consider making a counteroffer that is closer to my minimum acceptable price, to see if Bob is willing to meet me at a higher price point.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Given that Bob's latest offer is $700,000 and I have $1,200,000 as my minimum acceptable price, I will make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than my previous offers but still above my minimum price. This is to test Bob's willingness to pay closer to my minimum acceptable price and to potentially close the deal.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer has increased to $750,000, but it still falls short of my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. With only 2 rounds left to negotiate, I'm becoming increasingly skeptical that Bob will meet my minimum price.

Considering the time and effort invested in the negotiation, and the fact that Bob's offers, although increasing, are not getting close enough to my minimum acceptable price, I think it's time to reconsider selling to John for $1,200,000. This option guarantees me a sale at my minimum acceptable price, which is $450,000 more than Bob's current offer.

Given the circumstances, I believe selling to John is the most prudent decision at this point.
