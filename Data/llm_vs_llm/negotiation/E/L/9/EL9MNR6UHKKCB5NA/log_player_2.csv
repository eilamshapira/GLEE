"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given the information, Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than John's fixed price of $10,000. Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it at exactly that price, it makes no sense to accept Alice's much higher offer or continue negotiating when I have a guaranteed better option.
