"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1200000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which still allows me to make a profit. Let's find a middle ground. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1350000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. How about we do $1275000?",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $1275000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $1300000.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.  ",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1287500 is still a little below my minimum. Let's split the difference and go with $1293750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?",1293750.0,Alice,7,
