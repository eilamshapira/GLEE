Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's a perfect match for your needs. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1800000. Let me know if you're interested!,1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I must point out that $1800000 is significantly above my maximum budget. I know the product's market value and would like to make a counteroffer of $1300000, which I believe is fair for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand budgets are important, but given the quality and the market demand for this product, I'm confident in its true value. I'm willing to lower my initial offer and propose a price of $1600000. Let's find a deal that benefits both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, I want to be transparent - I can actually get this product from another seller for $1500000. I'd like to do business with you, but to make it worthwhile for me, I would need a better price. I can offer $1400000, which would still give you a good return while giving me a reason to choose you over other options.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
