Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I must point out that $1800000 is significantly above my maximum budget. I know the product's market value and would like to make a counteroffer of $1300000, which I believe is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'd like to do business with you, but to make it worthwhile for me, I would need a better price. I can offer $1400000, which would still give you a good return while giving me a reason to choose you over other options.
