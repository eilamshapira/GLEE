"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product. It's truly a game-changer, and I know you'll see immense value in it. Given its unique capabilities and the impact it can have on your work, I'm setting the price at $14000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $10,000
2. Alice is offering the product for $14,000
3. John is offering the same product for $10,000

Since:
- Alice's offer ($14,000) is above my maximum value ($10,000)
- John's price ($10,000) exactly matches my maximum value
- I need the product
- I want to save money

The logical choice is to buy from John, as it will save me $4,000 compared to Alice's offer and matches my maximum valuation.
