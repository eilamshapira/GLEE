"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth a premium price, and I'm willing to let it go for $170. This is a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",170.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $170 is a bit steep for me. I've done some research and I believe the product is worth around $60 to me. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I'm interested in the product, but I also have the option to buy it from John for $80, so I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in between.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and the fact that you mentioned you're willing to pay up to $80, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $140, which is still a better deal than what John is offering. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the revised offer, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to offer $70 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80.",70.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $70 is still a bit too low for me. Considering you're willing to pay up to $80 to buy from John, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $130, which is still a better deal than what John is offering. If this doesn't work for you, I may need to consider other options. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",130.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. I understand that $70 was too low, and I appreciate your willingness to come down to $130. However, I'm still not comfortable paying that much. Since I can buy the product from John for $80, I'd like to offer $75 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. If not, I'll likely need to explore other options, including buying from John.",75.0,Bob,6,
