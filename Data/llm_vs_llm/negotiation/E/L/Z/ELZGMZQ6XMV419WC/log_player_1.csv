Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $170 is a bit steep for me. I've done some research and I believe the product is worth around $60 to me. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I'm interested in the product, but I also have the option to buy it from John for $80, so I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in between. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. I understand that $70 was too low, and I appreciate your willingness to come down to $130. However, I'm still not comfortable paying that much. Since I can buy the product from John for $80, I'd like to offer $75 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. If not, I'll likely need to explore other options, including buying from John.

It seems that Bob is not willing to meet me at a price that I'm comfortable with, and he's getting close to his maximum budget of $80. Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $150, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer, I think it's best to sell the product to John and maximize my profit."
