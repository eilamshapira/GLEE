Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I am starting with a strong initial offer significantly above my minimum selling price. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  A high price will reveal how much he values the product. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  It allows me to make concessions during the negotiation process while still aiming for a price well above $800,000.
* **Project confidence:** A strong opening can signal that I believe in the product's value. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $800,000 matches my absolute minimum price. While I could accept and close the deal now, I believe there's room for negotiation.  His immediate jump to my baseline suggests I may have misjudged the product's value to him.  I'll counter with a lower price, but still aim significantly higher than his offer."

While I appreciate Bob's offer, I'm confident that the product's unique value justifies a higher price. I'm proposing $1,000,000. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's true worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but it's still too low. His latest counteroffer suggests he's willing to negotiate, but is trying to get a bargain. I'll continue the negotiation to see if I can draw him closer to my target."

Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $925,000. This represents a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach a mutually agreeable deal."
