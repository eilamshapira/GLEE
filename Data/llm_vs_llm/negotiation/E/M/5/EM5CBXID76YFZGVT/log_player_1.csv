"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product and I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start by making a high offer. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially settle on a higher price than if I started with a lower offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and also lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,200,000), and I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate, I will reject Bob's offer.

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer, in an attempt to meet Bob somewhere in the middle and maximize my earnings.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $500,000 and my initial offer was $2,500,000, I'll try to find a middle ground while still being mindful of my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial offer but still reflects the value I believe the product holds.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's new offer of $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it shows that he is willing to increase his offer. Since I have 6 rounds left to negotiate, I will reject Bob's offer again and try to bring him closer to my minimum acceptable price.

I will proceed to the next round and make another counteroffer that is lower than my previous one but still above Bob's current offer, in an attempt to meet him at a price that is more favorable to me.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's latest offer was $750,000 and my previous counteroffer was $2,000,000, I'll try to make a more significant concession to show that I'm willing to negotiate, while still aiming to get a price that's closer to my initial valuation. I'll reduce my counteroffer by a larger amount this time, but still keep it above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's new offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it's still below it. Since I have 4 rounds left to negotiate, I'm starting to consider the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob and the certainty of selling to John for $1,200,000.

However, I'll give Bob another chance to meet me at a price that's more favorable. I'll reject his offer again and make another counteroffer that's lower than my previous one, but still above $1,000,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's new offer of $950,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still $250,000 below the offer from John. Since I have 2 rounds left to negotiate, I'm starting to think that it's unlikely that Bob will meet me at $1,200,000.

Given the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob and the certainty of selling to John for $1,200,000, I think it's time to consider selling to John. Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to sell the product for less than it's worth to me.
