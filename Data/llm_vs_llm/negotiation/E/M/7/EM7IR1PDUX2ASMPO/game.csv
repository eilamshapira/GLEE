"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand my initial offer might have been high, so I'm willing to come down to $12000. This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value and quality.",12000.0,Alice,3,
