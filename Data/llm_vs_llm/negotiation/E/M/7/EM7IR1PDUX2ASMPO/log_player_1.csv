"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $13,500.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. $10,000 is too low considering the product's value to Bob ($15,000). There's still room for negotiation to reach a better price, and with 8 rounds remaining, we have time to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand my initial offer might have been high, so I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value and quality."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I accept Bob's offer of $11,000. This is a reasonable compromise that gives both parties value. The price is significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) and while it's below Bob's maximum value ($15,000), it represents a fair middle ground. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal, and $11,000 is a good outcome."
