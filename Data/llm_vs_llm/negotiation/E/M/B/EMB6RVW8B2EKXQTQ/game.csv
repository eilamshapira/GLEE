"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. After careful consideration of its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $11000. This is a premium product that I know will serve your needs well.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8500. Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your offer. However, $8500 is quite a bit lower than what this product is worth. I've invested significantly in it, and the market value is considerably higher. I can come down to $10200, which I believe is a fair price given the product's quality and value. This is already a substantial discount from my initial offer.",10200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  I could go up to $9000, but that's really my limit. It's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer and explaining your budget constraints. I understand you have limitations, but I also need to consider the true value of this product. I can come down to $9800, which represents a significant discount from both the market value and my initial offer. This is genuinely the best price I can offer while still making this deal worthwhile for both of us.",9800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference and settle at $9400? That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",9400.0,Bob,6,
