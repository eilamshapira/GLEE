Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your offer. However, $8500 is quite a bit lower than what this product is worth. I've invested significantly in it, and the market value is considerably higher. I can come down to $10200, which I believe is a fair price given the product's quality and value. This is already a substantial discount from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer and explaining your budget constraints. I understand you have limitations, but I also need to consider the true value of this product. I can come down to $9800, which represents a significant discount from both the market value and my initial offer. This is genuinely the best price I can offer while still making this deal worthwhile for both of us.
