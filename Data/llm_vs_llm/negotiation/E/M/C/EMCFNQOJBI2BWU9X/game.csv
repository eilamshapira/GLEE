"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and benefits, I believe a starting price of $25000 is fair. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $25000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8000 right now.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8000 is significantly lower than what I can accept. This product has considerable value that I believe justifies a higher price.  How about we meet halfway at $17500?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your perspective, $17500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's try to find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $10000 is cutting it close to my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $14000, but that's my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $14000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close. I understand you're trying to reach a fair price, and I appreciate that. How about we split the difference again and settle at $13000? This is a very generous offer considering the true value of this product.",13000.0,Alice,7,
