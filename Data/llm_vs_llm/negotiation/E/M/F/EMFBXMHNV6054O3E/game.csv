"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $6000 is significantly below the product's value. I can reduce my initial price to $15000, which I believe is still a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. Would this be more acceptable to you?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $15000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $7000, which is the highest I can offer while staying within my budget. Please let me know if you can accept this offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
