    ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price for the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"",

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $6000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. $6,000 is far too low, as it's even below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.

    ""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $6,000 is significantly below the product's value. I can reduce my initial price to $15,000, which I believe is still a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. Would this be more acceptable to you?"",

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $15000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $7000, which is the highest I can offer while staying within my budget. Please let me know if you can accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

Since Bob's highest offer of $7,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and he's only increased his offer by $1,000, it seems unlikely that we'll reach a mutually acceptable price. I'll take John's guaranteed offer of $12,000 rather than continue negotiations that appear unlikely to reach my minimum threshold."
