"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I believe the product's value to me tops out at $800000. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $600000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600000 is too far below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $1000000. This is my final offer, as I already have a buyer lined up at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1000000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $700000, which I believe is a fair compromise given the value I see in the product. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. Let's make this work - $850000, and we have a deal. This offer stands for this round only, as I am actively entertaining other offers.",850000.0,Alice,5,
