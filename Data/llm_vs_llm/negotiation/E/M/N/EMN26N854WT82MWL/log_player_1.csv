"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get more than my minimum acceptable price of $100.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","$140 is a good offer that's significantly above my minimum price of $100. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away, and I'd have to settle for $100 with John. I'll accept this offer.
