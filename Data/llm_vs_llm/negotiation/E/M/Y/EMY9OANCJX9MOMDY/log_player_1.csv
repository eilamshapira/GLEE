"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

```json
{""product_price"": 2500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $800,000, I have to make a strategic decision. Selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, which is significantly more than Bob's offer. I also know my minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000.

Therefore, I will choose to sell to John.
