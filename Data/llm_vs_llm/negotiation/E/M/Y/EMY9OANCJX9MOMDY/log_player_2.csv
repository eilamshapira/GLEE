"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","The product price offered by Alice ($2,500,000) is significantly higher than Jhon's price ($1,000,000) and exceeds the maximum value the product is worth to me. There's no reason to accept this offer, and since Jhon's price is already at my maximum acceptable price, I'll make a counteroffer to Alice first to see if I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's substantially lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.
