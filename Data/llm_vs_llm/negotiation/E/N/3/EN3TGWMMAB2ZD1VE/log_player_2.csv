"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Since Alice is offering the product for the same price as John ($150), and that's my maximum budget, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. I might as well buy from John."
