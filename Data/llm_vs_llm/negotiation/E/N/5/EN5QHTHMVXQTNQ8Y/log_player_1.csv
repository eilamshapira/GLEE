Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer to Bob that's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) but lower than the product's value to him ($1,500,000), leaving room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

{""product_price"": 1,300,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is only slightly above my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and significantly below the product's value to him ($1,500,000), I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer. I still have room to negotiate for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer somewhat but still maintain a price that would give me a good profit, considering Bob's first counteroffer and the product's value to him.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob has increased his offer by $50,000, showing he's willing to negotiate upward. While $1,150,000 is better than John's fixed offer of $1,000,000, there's still significant room between this offer and Bob's true valuation ($1,500,000). I believe we can reach a better deal through further negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll reduce my previous offer but still maintain a price that would give me a good profit, showing some flexibility while keeping in mind that Bob has been making incremental increases.
