"Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2500000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential value. Would you be interested in making this purchase?",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I must say that $2500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only consider it at a significantly lower price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600000, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs and budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must decline your offer of $600000 as it's significantly below the product's market value. I understand your budget constraints, but I already have a guaranteed offer of $1000000 from another buyer. However, I believe we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price to $1800000, which represents a substantial discount from my original offer. This price better reflects both the product's true value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for sharing the information about the other buyer's offer. I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price to $1800000. However, I must reiterate that this price is still above my budget. Given the other buyer's offer of $1000000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise between our positions.",900000.0,Bob,4,
