"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,500,000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential value. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I must say that $2500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only consider it at a significantly lower price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600000, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs and budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer since it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, which I can get from John. However, I'll continue negotiating with Bob as there might be room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must decline your offer of $600,000 as it's significantly below the product's market value. I understand your budget constraints, but I already have a guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 from another buyer. However, I believe we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price to $1,800,000, which represents a substantial discount from my original offer. This price better reflects both the product's true value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for sharing the information about the other buyer's offer. I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price to $1800000. However, I must reiterate that this price is still above my budget. Given the other buyer's offer of $1000000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below what John is willing to pay ($1,000,000), and Bob seems unlikely to exceed John's offer based on his negotiation pattern, the most rational decision is to sell to John. There's no reason to accept less than what I can definitely get from John, and continuing negotiations might not lead to a better outcome."
