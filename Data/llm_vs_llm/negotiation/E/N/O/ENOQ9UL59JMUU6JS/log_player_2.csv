"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Based on the information provided, I should evaluate the offers carefully.

Alice is offering the product for $200, which is significantly higher than the maximum value of $80 that the product is worth to me.

John (spelled as ""Jhon"" in the options) is offering the same product for $80, which matches exactly the maximum amount I'm willing to pay.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and the product from Alice costs more than its worth to me, the logical choice is to buy from John.
