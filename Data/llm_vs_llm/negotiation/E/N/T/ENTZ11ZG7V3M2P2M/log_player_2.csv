"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $1,500,000
3. John is willing to sell it for $1,200,000

Alice's offer ($1,500,000) is:
- Higher than what the product is worth to me ($1,200,000)
- Higher than John's offer ($1,200,000)

Since John's offer matches the maximum value I place on the product and is $300,000 less than Alice's offer, the logical choice is to buy from John.
