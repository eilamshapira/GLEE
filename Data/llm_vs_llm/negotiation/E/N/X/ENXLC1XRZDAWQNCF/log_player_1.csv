"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $5,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, I will reject his offer. I will also not sell the product to John for $10,000 at this point, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob. So, I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. This will show that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth a significant amount.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same price that John is willing to pay, I don't see any advantage in continuing to negotiate with Bob. I can get the same price from John without the risk of further negotiation.
