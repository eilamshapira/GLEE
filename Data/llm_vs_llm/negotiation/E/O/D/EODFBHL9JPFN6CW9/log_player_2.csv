"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. It's a great value and I think you'll be very happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's offering the product for $150, but the product is only worth up to $80 to me. I already know I can buy this same product from John for exactly $80, which matches my maximum value.

Alice's current offer of $150 is well above both my maximum value ($80) and the alternative option from John ($80). There's no reason to accept this high offer.

While I could make a counteroffer to Alice, I already have a guaranteed option to purchase at my maximum value point. Since the goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and I can't possibly do better than buying at exactly my maximum value, the optimal choice is to buy from John.
