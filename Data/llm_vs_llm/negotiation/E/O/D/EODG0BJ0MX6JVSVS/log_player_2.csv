"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $14,000 is still above my budget of $10,000. Since she rejected my previous counteroffer of $8,000, I'll try to meet her halfway and make another counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $13,500 is still above my budget of $10,000, but it's getting closer to a reasonable price. However, I'm not willing to pay that much, and I still have the option to buy from John for $10,000.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to make a counteroffer that is closer to my target budget.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer of $9,000 by a small amount to show that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable price. Since Alice's offer is decreasing, I'm hoping she'll be willing to meet me closer to my target budget.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $13,000 is still above my budget of $10,000. At this point, I'm starting to think that Alice is not willing to sell the product to me at a price that I'm comfortable with.

Since I have the option to buy from John for $10,000, which is still a better deal than Alice's current offer, I'm inclined to walk away from the negotiation with Alice.
