"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a product that I believe would be highly valuable for your needs. Given its quality and features, I'm offering it to you for $12500. This represents a fair price considering the $15000 value you'd receive from it, giving you a $2500 surplus. I have another buyer, John, ready to purchase it, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity since I believe this would be a mutually beneficial transaction.",12500.0,Alice,1,
