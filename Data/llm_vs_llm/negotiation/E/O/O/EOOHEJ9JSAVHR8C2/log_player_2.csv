"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a product that I believe would be highly valuable for your needs. Given its quality and features, I'm offering it to you for $12500. This represents a fair price considering the $15000 value you'd receive from it, giving you a $2500 surplus. I have another buyer, John, ready to purchase it, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity since I believe this would be a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
