"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $20,000 against my alternatives. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and I can buy it from John for exactly $8,000. Alice's asking price of $20,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and my alternative option.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is only worth up to $8,000 to me and I have the option to buy from John at $8,000, I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice that's below this price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price from $20,000 to $17,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000 and higher than John's price of $8,000. Since I can get the same product from John for $8,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I see that Alice has come down from $20,000 to $17,000, showing some flexibility. However, since I can buy the product from John for $8,000, and that's my maximum value, I need to keep my counteroffer competitive but slightly better than just going to John directly.

{""product_price"": 6500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price again to $15,500, which shows continued willingness to negotiate. However, this is still nearly double my maximum value of $8,000 and the price I can get from John. There's still a significant gap between our positions.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I notice Alice is gradually coming down in price, but still remains well above the $8,000 that I can pay to John. Since we're now in round 6 of 10, I'll increase my offer slightly to show good faith in the negotiation, while still keeping it well below my alternative option.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice continues to lower her price, now offering $14,000. While this shows progress in our negotiation, it's still significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000 and John's price of $8,000. Since I can buy the same product from John for $8,000, Alice's current offer doesn't make economic sense for me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","We're now in round 8 of 10, and Alice has been gradually reducing her price but is still well above my alternative option. I'll make one more reasonable increase to my offer to see if we can bridge the gap, but I need to keep it below my $8,000 limit.
