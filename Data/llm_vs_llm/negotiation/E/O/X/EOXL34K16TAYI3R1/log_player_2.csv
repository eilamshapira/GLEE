"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The rational choice is to buy from John because:
1. Alice's offer ($1,200,000) is above my maximum value ($1,000,000)
2. John's price ($1,000,000) equals my maximum value
3. I can save $200,000 by buying from John instead of Alice"
