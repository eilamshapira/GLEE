"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.  I'm aware I can always fall back on John's offer of $10,000 if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $5,000 is unacceptable.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $12,000, still a significant profit for me but more reasonable than my initial offer. I'm hoping this will be more enticing for Bob while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, though it's getting closer. I'm not yet ready to sell for that price, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm now willing to go down to my floor price of $10,000.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be forced to consider selling to John.  Hopefully, this is an acceptable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With Bob continuing to lowball me and only 4 rounds left, I'm going to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John.  It's not ideal, but it's a sure thing and better than risking a deal falling through completely."
