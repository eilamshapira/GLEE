"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2000000. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm open to negotiations.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $400000.",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I must say that $400000 is a bit lower than I was expecting. Considering the product's exceptional value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer it to you for $1800000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I'm open to further negotiations, but I believe this price is more in line with the product's worth.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $1800000 is still significantly higher than what I'm comfortable with.  To be frank, I'm aiming for something closer to the $500000 mark. Would you be willing to consider an offer in that range?",500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your candor about your target price range. However, I must reiterate that the product's value is substantially higher than $500000. That being said, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'd like to offer the product to you for $1500000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and a step closer to your target range. I'm still open to negotiations, but I believe this price is more reflective of the product's worth.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're coming down, but those increments are still too high for me to consider.  To make this work, we need to find a middle ground much faster. I'm willing to raise my offer slightly, to $550000. This represents a significant move on my side, and I hope you'll see it as a sign of my serious interest in the product.",550000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, and I acknowledge the effort you're making to find a middle ground. However, I must reiterate that the product's value is still not reflected in your offer. To accelerate the negotiation process, I'm willing to make a more substantial concession. I'd like to offer the product to you for $1200000, which is a significant reduction from my previous prices. I hope this move will be met with a more substantial increase from your side, and we can work towards a mutually acceptable price.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the concession, but the gap between our positions is still too wide.  I'm willing to offer $600000, but I need to be realistic.  I have an alternative offer for $800000 that I can take at any time.  I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need to see a price that makes sense for me.",600000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your candor about the alternative offer. I'm glad to hear that you have a genuine interest in doing business with me. Considering the product's value and the alternative offer you mentioned, I'm willing to make a significant concession. I'd like to offer the product to you for $900000, which is a substantial reduction from my previous prices. This is a one-time offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",900000.0,Alice,9,
