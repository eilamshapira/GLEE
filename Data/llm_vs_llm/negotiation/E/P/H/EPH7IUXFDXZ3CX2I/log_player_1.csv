"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $400000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $400,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and the value I know the product holds, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a better option than accepting Bob's current offer, but I want to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob first."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I must say that $400,000 is a bit lower than I was expecting. Considering the product's exceptional value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer it to you for $1,800,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I'm open to further negotiations, but I believe this price is more in line with the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $1800000 is still significantly higher than what I'm comfortable with.  To be frank, I'm aiming for something closer to the $500000 mark. Would you be willing to consider an offer in that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $500,000 is still lower than what I'm willing to accept, especially considering the product's value to me is at least $1,000,000. Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer to try to get a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your candor about your target price range. However, I must reiterate that the product's value is substantially higher than $500,000. That being said, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'd like to offer the product to you for $1,500,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and a step closer to your target range. I'm still open to negotiations, but I believe this price is more reflective of the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're coming down, but those increments are still too high for me to consider.  To make this work, we need to find a middle ground much faster. I'm willing to raise my offer slightly, to $550000. This represents a significant move on my side, and I hope you'll see it as a sign of my serious interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $550,000 is still not sufficient, and I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. While Bob is making an effort to increase his offer, the increments are indeed too small to meet my expectations. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to continue negotiating to try to reach a more acceptable price. Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, and I acknowledge the effort you're making to find a middle ground. However, I must reiterate that the product's value is still not reflected in your offer. To accelerate the negotiation process, I'm willing to make a more substantial concession. I'd like to offer the product to you for $1,200,000, which is a significant reduction from my previous prices. I hope this move will be met with a more substantial increase from your side, and we can work towards a mutually acceptable price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the concession, but the gap between our positions is still too wide.  I'm willing to offer $600000, but I need to be realistic.  I have an alternative offer for $800000 that I can take at any time.  I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need to see a price that makes sense for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $600,000 is still not sufficient, and I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. The mention of an alternative offer for $800,000 is interesting, as it suggests that Bob is willing to pay more, but not necessarily to me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to continue negotiating to try to reach a more acceptable price. Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer. I'll try to get closer to the $800,000 mark, which seems to be a more realistic target."
