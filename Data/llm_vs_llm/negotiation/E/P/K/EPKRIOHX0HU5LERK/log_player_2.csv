Alice's offer is much higher than both your limit and what John offers. You should definitely try to negotiate a better price."

This is a starting point for negotiation.  It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it allows room for counteroffers and compromise."

While Alice came down a bit, $16,000 is still too high. We're getting closer to my limit, but John's offer is looking more appealing. I'll counteroffer, but be ready to walk away."

This offer puts some pressure on Alice and moves closer to a price I'd consider. It also signals that I have an alternative and am serious about not overpaying."

Alice is barely budging, and the price is still too high.  I'm going to make one last attempt to get closer to my range, but I'm prepared to walk away."

This is my final offer. It's a slight increase to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go any higher."
