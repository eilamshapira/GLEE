"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional quality and the value it brings, I'm sure you'll find it's well worth the investment of $18000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $18,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $12,000

Alice's offer of $18,000 is far too high compared to both my maximum value and John's alternative offer. While I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, the initial price gap is very large, and I already have a guaranteed option to buy at $12,000 from John.
