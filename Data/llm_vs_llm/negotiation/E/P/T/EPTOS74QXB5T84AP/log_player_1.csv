Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $100 is higher than the minimum value of $80 that I have for the product, and it's a reasonable offer, I will consider it. However, I still want to try to earn as much money as I can for the product. 

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send Bob a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob was willing to pay $100, I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my initial offer of $120.
