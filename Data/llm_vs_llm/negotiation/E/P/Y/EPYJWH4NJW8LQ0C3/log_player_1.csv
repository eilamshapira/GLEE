"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product and I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start by making a high offer. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially settle on a higher price than if I started with a lower offer.

{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than my initial valuation of the product, and it's also lower than the $800,000 I can get from John, I'll reject Bob's offer.

However, I don't want to sell the product to John just yet, as there's still a possibility that Bob might be willing to pay a higher price. So, I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $500,000 and my initial offer was $1,200,000, I'll try to find a middle ground while still aiming to get a high price for the product. I'll reduce my offer, but not by too much, to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.

{""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer of $600,000 is still lower than my previous counteroffer, but it's getting closer to a price that I might consider acceptable. However, it's still lower than the $800,000 I can get from John.

Since Bob is increasing his offer, it shows that he's interested in the product and willing to negotiate. I'll reject his offer again and try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's last offer was $600,000 and my previous counteroffer was $1,000,000, I'll try to find a compromise. I'll reduce my offer again, but not too much, to see if Bob is willing to meet me closer to my target price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer of $700,000 is getting closer to the price I can get from John, which is $800,000. However, it's still $100,000 lower.

At this point, I'm not sure if Bob is willing to go higher, but I'm also not willing to sell the product to him for a price that's significantly lower than what I can get from John.

I'll reject Bob's offer again and try to get a better price, but I'm also considering selling to John if Bob's next offer isn't significantly higher.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's last offer was $700,000 and I can get $800,000 from John, I'll make a counteroffer that's close to John's price. This will give Bob a chance to meet me at a price that's reasonable, and it will also show him that I'm not willing to sell the product for much less than what I can get from John.
