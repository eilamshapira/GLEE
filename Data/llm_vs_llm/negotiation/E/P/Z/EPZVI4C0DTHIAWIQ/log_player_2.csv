You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is offering the product for the maximum price I'm willing to pay. I can get the same price from John, so there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer."
