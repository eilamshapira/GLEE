"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it for $9500. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $9,500
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $8,000

Alice's offer of $9,500 is higher than both my maximum valuation ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000). It would not be rational to accept Alice's offer when I can get the same product for $1,500 less from John.

While I could reject and make a counteroffer, since Alice's initial offer is significantly above my maximum value and John's price, it might be more efficient to simply buy from John.
