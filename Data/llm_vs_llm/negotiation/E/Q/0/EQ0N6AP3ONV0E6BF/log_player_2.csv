"Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer ($160) is higher than both my maximum value ($150) and John's price ($150), it would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. Given that John is offering the product at $150, which matches my maximum value, I should buy from John.
