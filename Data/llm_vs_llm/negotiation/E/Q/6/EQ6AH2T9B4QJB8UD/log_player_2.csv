"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $18000.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Looking at Alice's offer:

1. Alice is offering the product for $18,000
2. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
3. John is willing to sell me the same product for $10,000

Since Alice's offer ($18,000) exceeds both the value of the product to me and John's alternative offer, the rational choice is to buy from John instead.
