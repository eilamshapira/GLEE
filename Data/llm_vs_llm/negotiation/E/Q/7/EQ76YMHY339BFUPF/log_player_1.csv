"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,800,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but my budget is more limited. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: I'll reject Bob's offer of $1,000,000 because:
1. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000
2. It's even below the product's worth to Bob ($1,200,000)
3. I have John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 as a backup
4. We're only in round 2, so there's room to negotiate with Bob
5. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round closer to Bob's maximum value of $1,200,000"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's market value. Given the product's quality and features, I can offer it at $1,650,000, which is a considerable reduction from my initial price. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 1650000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I have to consider my budget constraints. I can offer $1100000 for the product. I believe this amount is reasonable and reflects a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Reasoning: I'm choosing to sell to John because:
1. Bob's second offer ($1,100,000) is still well below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000)
2. The increase in Bob's offer was minimal (only $100,000 more than his first offer)
3. Bob's maximum value for the product is $1,200,000, so he won't go much higher
4. John's offer of $1,500,000 meets my minimum acceptable price
5. Continuing negotiations with Bob is unlikely to result in a better outcome than John's guaranteed offer"
