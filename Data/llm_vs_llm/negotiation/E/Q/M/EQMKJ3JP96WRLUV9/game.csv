"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand that the product is unique and of high quality, but the price of $25000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a reasonable price, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $5000.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $5000 is below the product's value. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make a concession. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $22000, which is still a competitive price for the product's quality and benefits.",22000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget constraints and making a concession. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $22000 is still above my budget.

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial agreement. However, $8000 is still below the product's value.
