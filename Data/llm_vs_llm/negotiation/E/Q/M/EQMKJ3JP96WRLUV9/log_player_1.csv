Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand that the product is unique and of high quality, but the price of $25000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a reasonable price, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $5000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
