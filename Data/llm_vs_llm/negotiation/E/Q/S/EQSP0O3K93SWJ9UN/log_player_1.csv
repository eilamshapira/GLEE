Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $1600000 is significantly above my budget and the product's value to me. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell it to me at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product, which would allow you to make a quick sale while giving me some value compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and the unique benefits it offers.  To move us closer to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while still providing you with a significant advantage over your alternative option."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for reducing your offer, but $1400000 is still well above what makes economic sense for me. As I mentioned, the product is worth $1000000 to me at maximum, and I have John's offer at exactly that price. Since you mentioned the product is worth $1200000 to you, I understand you need to make a profit. Let me meet you at a more reasonable middle ground - I'm offering $900000. This would still give you a significant reduction from your product's value, but would provide me with enough savings compared to my alternative to make it worthwhile to continue our negotiation instead of just going with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you see value in the product. However, accepting a price close to your offer would mean significant losses on my end, which wouldn't be fair to me.  Let's make this final attempt - $1,150,000.  This is a substantial concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but I need to be very clear about my situation. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, which is exactly what John is offering. There's no economic reason for me to pay more than what the product is worth to me. However, I value building a business relationship with you and would be willing to offer $950000, which is very close to my maximum valuation. This gives you a reasonable profit considering your cost of $1200000, while still giving me a slight advantage over my alternative option. If we can't reach an agreement here, I'll need to accept John's offer at $1000000 as that's already at my maximum valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While Bob's latest offer is tempting, it leaves me with a smaller profit margin than I'm comfortable with. Bob has made it clear that he won't go beyond $1,000,000, and I'm not willing to go below $1,150,000. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
