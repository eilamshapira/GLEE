"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, though. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

I'll **(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.** and make a counteroffer.

I'll **(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.** and make another counteroffer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my next counteroffer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, $175 is still beyond what I'm willing to spend. Could you consider $135? I really want to make this work.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer. I need to be more aggressive now:
