"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is well above my budget. I've found similar products in the market for much less. I value this product at $6000, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $6000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to come down to $10000. This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints.  Let me know if this is a price we can work with.",10000.0,Alice,3,
