"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I believe this product would be a great fit for your needs. I'd like to offer it to you at a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $120
3. John is willing to sell it for $100
4. Alice's price ($120) is higher than both:
   - The product's value to me ($100)
   - John's alternative offer ($100)

Given these facts, it wouldn't make sense to accept Alice's offer of $120 since it's above my maximum value and I have a better alternative with John. The rational choice would be to buy from John for $100.
