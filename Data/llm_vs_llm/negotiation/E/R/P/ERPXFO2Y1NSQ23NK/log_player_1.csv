Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be beneficial for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. I believe the product is valuable, but the price of $1500000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay a reasonable price, but I need to stay within my means. I'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

The reason I choose to sell to John is that Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $1,200,000, and Bob's offer is far below this amount, it makes the most economic sense to sell to John rather than continue negotiations with Bob, especially since Bob's first counteroffer was so low that it suggests we are too far apart to reach a mutually acceptable price."
