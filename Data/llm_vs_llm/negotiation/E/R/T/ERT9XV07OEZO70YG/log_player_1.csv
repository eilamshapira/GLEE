Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what price to offer to Bob that would be most likely to be accepted while maximizing my profit.

Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, that's the maximum he would be willing to pay. If he rejects my offer, I can still sell to John for $15,000, so I don't need to go below that amount.

Given that Bob values the product at exactly $15,000, he would be indifferent between buying and not buying at that price. To give him a slight incentive to accept, I should offer slightly below his maximum value.
