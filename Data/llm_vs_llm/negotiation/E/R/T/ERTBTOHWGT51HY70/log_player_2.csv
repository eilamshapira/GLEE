Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that $120 might be a stretch for your budget. Would you consider meeting me in the middle at $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.

There's no point in negotiating further. Alice is already at the same price John is offering, and further haggling is unlikely to yield a better price.  It's time to move on."
