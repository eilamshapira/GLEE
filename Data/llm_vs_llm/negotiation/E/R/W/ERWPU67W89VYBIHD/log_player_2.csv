"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000 and also higher than John's guaranteed price. It would be reasonable to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, starting with a lower price to see if we can negotiate a better deal than John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 600000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $600,000, which is significantly below John's price of $800,000. This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to get a better deal than John's offer. If Alice accepts, I'll save $200,000 compared to buying from John. If she counters, we still have room to negotiate upward while staying below John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has reduced her price from $1.2M to $1M, showing willingness to negotiate, but it's still significantly above John's price of $800,000. Since we still have 7 rounds left for negotiation, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000 if negotiations with Alice don't reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'll increase my offer to $700,000, which shows movement toward a middle ground while still remaining below John's price of $800,000. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate upward from my previous offer of $600,000, while maintaining potential for savings compared to John's price. If Alice accepts, I'll save $100,000 compared to John's offer. If she counters, we still have room to negotiate within the remaining rounds."
