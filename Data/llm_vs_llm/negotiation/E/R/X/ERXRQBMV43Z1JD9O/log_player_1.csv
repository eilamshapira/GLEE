"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's counteroffer of $80 is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I also have the option to sell it to John for the same price, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price with him.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I still think the product is worth more than $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $100."", ""product_price"": 100}"
