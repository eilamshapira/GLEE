"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll reject Bob's offer since it's significantly below even my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. There's no reason to accept an offer that's less than what John is willing to pay.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

My counteroffer will be $1,800,000, showing some flexibility from my initial offer while maintaining a strong negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer of $600,000 is still well below John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000. Since we've gone through several rounds and Bob's incremental increase is small (only $100,000 from his previous offer), it seems he might not be willing to reach a price point that would be better than John's offer. At this point, it's safer to take the guaranteed money from John.
