Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what price to offer Bob for the product. 

The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, and I have a guaranteed fallback option of selling to John for $800,000 if Bob rejects my offer.

Since the product is worth exactly $800,000 to Bob, he would be indifferent between buying it at $800,000 or not buying it. However, if I offer even slightly above $800,000, he would reject the offer since it would be a net loss for him.

Given that I have a guaranteed alternative buyer at $800,000, I should offer Bob exactly $800,000, which is the maximum I can reasonably expect him to accept.
