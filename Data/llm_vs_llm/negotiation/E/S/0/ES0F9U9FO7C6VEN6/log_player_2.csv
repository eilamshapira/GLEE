"Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer compared to my alternatives.

Alice is offering the product for $800,000.
The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me.
If I reject Alice, I can buy from John for $800,000.

Both Alice and John are offering the same price of $800,000, which is exactly what the product is worth to me. Since there's no price difference, I'm indifferent between the two options.
