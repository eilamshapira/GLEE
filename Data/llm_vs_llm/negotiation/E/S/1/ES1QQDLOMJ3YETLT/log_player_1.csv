"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay a significantly lower price. I'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $80 because it's significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $120. I'd like to make a counteroffer to see if we can meet at a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be out of your budget, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Let's try to meet somewhere in between."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd like to make another counteroffer that's closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $90 because it's still below the minimum value I have for the product, which is $120. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us. My next counteroffer will be slightly lower than my previous one, to show that I'm still open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm trying to be flexible, but I still need to get a fair price for the product. I'll meet you halfway between my previous offer and your last counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, $120 is still a bit above my budget. Considering your last offer and my previous counteroffer, I'd like to make another counteroffer that's closer to what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I have the option to sell the product to John for $120, which is my minimum value, I decide to sell the product to John. This ensures that I get a fair price for the product, and I don't have to continue negotiating with Bob."
