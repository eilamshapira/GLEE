"I understand you're working with a budget, Bob.  However, $70 is too low for me.  I could come down to $100. This is a significant reduction and reflects my willingness to make a deal.",100.0,Alice,3,
"Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility, but $100 stretches my budget to its limit. How about we settle at $90 instead?",90.0,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I understand you value the product at around $100, but my budget is really tight. To make this work, could you sell it for $85? I believe this is a fair offer for both of us, and I can close the deal immediately.",85.0,Bob,4,
