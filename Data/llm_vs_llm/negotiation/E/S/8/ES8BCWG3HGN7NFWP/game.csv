"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $1100000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I understand my initial offer was high, so I'm willing to reduce it significantly. I can offer the product for $1350000, which is a $100000 reduction from my initial price. This is still a great value considering the product's worth of $1500000 to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $1350000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $1200000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and should be close to your minimum acceptable price. What do you say?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1200000, which shows your serious interest. However, given that this product would provide you with $1500000 in value, I believe we can find a middle ground that benefits us both. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1275000. This would give you a substantial $225000 in value while still providing me with a fair return. This is a significant reduction from my previous offers.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, $1275000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1225000. This is a significant increase from my last offer and should be very close to your minimum acceptable price. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
