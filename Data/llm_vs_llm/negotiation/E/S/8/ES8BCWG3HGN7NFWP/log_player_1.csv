"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential returns."", ""product_price"": 1450000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $1,100,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Since John is willing to pay $1,200,000, I would not accept anything lower than that. I will make a counteroffer in the next round with a more reasonable price reduction from my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $1,100,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I understand my initial offer was high, so I'm willing to reduce it significantly. I can offer the product for $1,350,000, which is a $100,000 reduction from my initial price. This is still a great value considering the product's worth of $1,500,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $1350000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $1200000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and should be close to your minimum acceptable price. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob is now offering $1,200,000 (the same as John's offer), and we know the product is worth $1,500,000 to him, I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a better price. I will make another counteroffer that's lower than my previous one but still above $1,200,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,200,000, which shows your serious interest. However, given that this product would provide you with $1,500,000 in value, I believe we can find a middle ground that benefits us both. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,275,000. This would give you a substantial $225,000 in value while still providing me with a fair return. This is a significant reduction from my previous offers."", ""product_price"": 1275000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, $1275000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1225000. This is a significant increase from my last offer and should be very close to your minimum acceptable price. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,225,000. This is a reasonable compromise as it's $25,000 more than John's offer of $1,200,000, and while we might continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob could walk away, leaving us with only John's lower offer. This deal ensures we get more than our minimum acceptable price, and both parties benefit from the transaction."
