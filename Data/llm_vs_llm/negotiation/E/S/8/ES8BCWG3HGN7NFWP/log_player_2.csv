Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $1100000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1200000, which shows your serious interest. However, given that this product would provide you with $1500000 in value, I believe we can find a middle ground that benefits us both. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1275000. This would give you a substantial $225000 in value while still providing me with a fair return. This is a significant reduction from my previous offers.
