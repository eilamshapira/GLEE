"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $12,000 to me, and Alice is willing to sell it for $12,000, there is no immediate benefit in accepting her offer.  I can try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer gives me the opportunity to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's slightly above Alice's value of $10,000. This shows I'm serious about buying but also aims to get a good deal. There's room for negotiation, and I'm hoping Alice will be willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,200 is a good compromise. It's within my budget and significantly lower than the $12,000 I would pay to John. Accepting this offer allows me to save $800 compared to buying from John."
