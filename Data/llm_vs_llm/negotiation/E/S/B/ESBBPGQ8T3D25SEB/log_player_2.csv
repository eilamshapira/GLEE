"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I can offer it to you for $14000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Looking at the information provided:

1. Alice is offering the product for $14,000
2. The product is worth at most $8,000 to me
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $8,000

Since Alice's price ($14,000) is significantly higher than what the product is worth to me ($8,000), and I have an alternative option to buy from John at exactly $8,000, the logical decision is to buy from John.
