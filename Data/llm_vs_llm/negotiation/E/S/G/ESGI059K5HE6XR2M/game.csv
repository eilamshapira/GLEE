"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I know I can get this product from John for $100. However, I'd like to work with you if we can find a fair price. Would you consider selling it for $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to lower my price to $200. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,3,
