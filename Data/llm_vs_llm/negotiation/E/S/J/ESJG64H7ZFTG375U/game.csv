"Hello Bob! I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $180. This is a fair price considering its features and value. Would you be interested in making this purchase?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $140 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'd like to work with you to find a middle ground. Given the product's value, I can offer it to you for $165. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects the true value of the product.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $165 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $155? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",155.0,Bob,4,
