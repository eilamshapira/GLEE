"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $180. This is a fair price considering its features and value. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $140. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since $140 is below my minimum acceptable price ($150), and even below John's guaranteed offer, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer. We still have several rounds to negotiate, and I believe we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $140 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'd like to work with you to find a middle ground. Given the product's value, I can offer it to you for $165. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 165}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $165 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $155? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $155. This is a reasonable compromise that's above my minimum acceptable price of $150 and better than John's guaranteed offer. While we might potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price, there's also the risk of losing the deal, and $155 represents a satisfactory outcome for both parties."
