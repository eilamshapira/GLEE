"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I find the price to be quite steep. Given my budget and the current market conditions, I'm willing to offer $400000 for the product.",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $400000 is far below the product's value. I can offer it for $2000000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. This price better reflects the true value and quality of the product.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still find the price too high. I'm willing to raise my offer to $500000 to meet you in the middle. This price point aligns better with my budget and what I believe is a fair market value for the product. I hope to close the deal at this price.",500000.0,Bob,4,
