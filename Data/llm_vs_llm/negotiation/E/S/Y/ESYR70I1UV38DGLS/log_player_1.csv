"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,300,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential returns."", ""product_price"": 2300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I find the price to be quite steep. Given my budget and the current market conditions, I'm willing to offer $400000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. The offered price of $400,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and I can already get that amount from John. However, I believe we can find a middle ground that works for both parties.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $400,000 is far below the product's value. I can offer it for $2,000,000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. This price better reflects the true value and quality of the product."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still find the price too high. I'm willing to raise my offer to $500000 to meet you in the middle. This price point aligns better with my budget and what I believe is a fair market value for the product. I hope to close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John. Bob's offers are consistently far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and his latest increase of only $100,000 suggests he's not willing to move significantly higher. Given we've already gone through several rounds with minimal progress, and Bob's offers remain at about one-third of John's guaranteed price, it's best to conclude the negotiation and accept John's offer of $1,500,000."
