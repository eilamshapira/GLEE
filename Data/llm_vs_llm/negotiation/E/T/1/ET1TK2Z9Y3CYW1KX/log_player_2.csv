"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","In this scenario, Alice is offering the product for $12,000, but the product is only worth up to $10,000 to me. Additionally, I have the option to buy the same product from John for $10,000. 

Since Alice's offer exceeds the maximum value I place on the product ($10,000), and I can get the exact same product from John for $10,000, the rational decision would be to buy from John.
