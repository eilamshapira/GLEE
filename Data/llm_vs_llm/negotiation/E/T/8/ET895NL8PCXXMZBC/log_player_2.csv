"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to analyze this offer carefully.

Alice is offering the product for $10,000, but the product is only worth $8,000 to me (that's my maximum valuation). Accepting Alice's offer would mean I'm paying $2,000 more than the product is worth to me, which would be a financial loss.

John is willing to sell me the exact same product for $8,000, which is exactly what the product is worth to me. This means I wouldn't save any money, but I wouldn't lose any either.

I could reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, but since Alice values the product at $8,000, she won't accept anything below that. Given that John is already offering $8,000, there's no advantage in continuing the negotiation with Alice.

The rational choice is to buy from John at $8,000.
