"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'll analyze this situation carefully. Alice's offer is $20,000, which is double the price that John is offering ($10,000). Additionally, the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, so paying $20,000 would be a net loss.

Since this is only round 1 of 10 possible rounds, it makes sense to reject Alice's initial high offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This gives us an opportunity to potentially negotiate a better price than what John is offering.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable counteroffer that acknowledges the significant gap between Alice's initial offer and my valuation. Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me (and John is offering it at exactly that price), I'll start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": $5,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has only reduced her price from $20,000 to $18,000, which is still significantly higher than John's price of $10,000 and higher than the maximum value the product has to me. Since this is only round 3 of 10, I still have room to negotiate for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has only dropped her price by $2,000 from her initial offer, suggesting she may be willing to negotiate but is starting from a very high position. I'll increase my previous offer slightly but still remain well below John's price to leave room for further negotiation.

{""product_price"": $7,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has significantly reduced her price from $18,000 to $12,500, which shows she's willing to negotiate substantially. However, this price is still above John's price of $10,000, and since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, accepting this offer would not be optimal.

Since we're halfway through the negotiation (round 5 of 10), and Alice seems to be moving in the right direction, I'll reject and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has moved substantially from her initial position, dropping from $20,000 to $12,500. This significant movement suggests she may be motivated to sell and could accept a price closer to John's offer. At this point, I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to but still below John's $10,000 price.

{""product_price"": $8,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has now reduced her price to $10,000, which is exactly the same as John's offer. Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and this matches the best alternative I have, it makes sense to accept this offer.

While I could try to negotiate further, there's risk in pushing too hard when we already have a fair price that matches my alternative option. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate by reducing her price significantly from $20,000 to $10,000.
