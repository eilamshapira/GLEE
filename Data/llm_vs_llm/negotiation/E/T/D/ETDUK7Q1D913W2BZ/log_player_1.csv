"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $12,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer and the quality you mentioned, but after careful consideration, I'd be comfortable buying it for $10000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $10,000 is a decent offer and better than John's $8,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation since we're only in round 2 of 10. I'll make a counteroffer to try to achieve a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer of $10,000 is reasonable, given the product's quality and market value, I could come down to $11,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents excellent value. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility so far. I understand the value of your product, and I'm eager to make this deal work, but I need to stick close to my budget. Would you accept $10250 as a fair compromise? This is my best offer, and I hope we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $10,250. This is a reasonable compromise for several reasons:
1. It's significantly better than John's backup offer of $8,000
2. Bob indicated this is his best offer
3. While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk Bob might withdraw or lose interest
4. The price represents a decent profit margin above my minimum of $8,000
5. We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and the incremental increases are getting smaller"
