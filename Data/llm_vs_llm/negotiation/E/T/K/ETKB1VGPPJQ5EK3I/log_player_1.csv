Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm confident it will be a valuable addition to your collection. I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's quite a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. I can offer $4000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $4,000 is significantly lower than my initial asking price and the value I know the product holds, I will reject his offer. I am willing to negotiate, but I believe the product is worth more than what Bob is offering. I will make a counteroffer in the next round to try to reach a mutually agreeable price.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to be flexible, but I believe this price better reflects the product's value."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see. Well, I'm still interested, but I can't go that high. How about $5000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Since Bob's offer of $5,000 is still significantly lower than my asking price and the value I know the product holds, I will reject his offer. However, I notice that Bob is willing to increase his offer, which suggests that he is interested in the product and may be willing to go higher.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still looking for a better price. I'd be willing to consider $10,500. This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 10500}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice, but I need to stick to my budget. I can offer $6500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $6,500 is still lower than my asking price and the value I know the product holds, I will reject his offer. However, I notice that Bob is continuing to increase his offer, which suggests that he is serious about purchasing the product.

Considering the gap between Bob's offer and my asking price, I will make one more attempt to reach a mutually agreeable price. If Bob is unwilling to meet me at a higher price, I will consider selling to John for $10,000.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I'm willing to make one final concession and consider selling at $9,500.
