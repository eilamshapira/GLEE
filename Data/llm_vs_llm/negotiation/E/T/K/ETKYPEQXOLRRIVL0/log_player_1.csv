Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12000 is quite high for this product. Based on my market research, I believe a more reasonable price would be $7000. This would still provide you with a good return while being more aligned with current market values. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
