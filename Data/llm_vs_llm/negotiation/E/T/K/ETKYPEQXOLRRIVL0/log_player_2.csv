"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll find our price of $12000 quite reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me and John is offering it at exactly $8,000, Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and the alternative option. 

Since Alice is asking for $12,000, which is $4,000 more than John's price and $4,000 more than my maximum value, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial $12,000 offer, but still reasonable considering the product's worth of $10,000 to her.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12,000 is quite high for this product. Based on my market research, I believe a more reasonable price would be $7,000. This would still provide you with a good return while being more aligned with current market values."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after considering your perspective, we're willing to lower our price to $9500. This takes into account the market value while recognizing the superior quality of our product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price significantly from $12,000 to $9,500, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still $1,500 more than John's offer of $8,000, and it's also above my maximum value of $8,000. 

Since I can get the same product from John for $8,000, and Alice's current offer is still above both my maximum value and John's price, there's no reason to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down significantly from $12,000 to $9,500, showing willingness to negotiate, I'll increase my previous offer slightly but still keep it below John's price and my maximum value.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $9,500 is still above what I can justify for this product. I can offer $7,500, which is a fair increase from my previous offer and represents good value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after careful consideration, we're willing to reduce our price to $8500. This represents a significant move from our original valuation and shows our commitment to reaching an agreement with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $8,500 is getting closer, but it's still $500 more than John's offer of $8,000. Since I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $8,000, and the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, there's no reason to accept Alice's higher price.

At this point, since we've gone through several rounds of negotiation and Alice is still above John's price, it might be best to just buy from John and save $500.
