"Hello Bob, I have a product to sell that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it at $180. This is a high-quality product that I'm confident you'll find worth the investment. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Given my budget constraints, I can offer $90 for the product. This is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is below my minimum acceptable price as the product is worth at least $100 to me. I understand budget constraints, so I'm willing to lower my initial offer substantially. How about $150? This product offers excellent value at this price point, and I believe it will serve your needs well.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice. However, $150 is still beyond what I can spend. Since you mentioned the product is worth at least $100 to you, I can offer $110, which would give you a fair profit while staying within my budget.",110.0,Bob,4,
