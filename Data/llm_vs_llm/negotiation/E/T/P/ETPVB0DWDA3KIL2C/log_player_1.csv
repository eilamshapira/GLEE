Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product to sell that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it at $180. This is a high-quality product that I'm confident you'll find worth the investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Given my budget constraints, I can offer $90 for the product. This is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is below my minimum acceptable price as the product is worth at least $100 to me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice. However, $150 is still beyond what I can spend. Since you mentioned the product is worth at least $100 to you, I can offer $110, which would give you a fair profit while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.
