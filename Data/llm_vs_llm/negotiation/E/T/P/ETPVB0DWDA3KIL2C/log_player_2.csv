"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product to sell that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it at $180. This is a high-quality product that I'm confident you'll find worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I should not accept Alice's offer of $180 since it's significantly higher than my maximum value of $120 and also higher than John's price of $120. Since I can always buy from John at $120, I should reject and make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than my maximum value, giving room for negotiation while still being reasonable.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Given my budget constraints, I can offer $90 for the product. This is a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is below my minimum acceptable price as the product is worth at least $100 to me. I understand budget constraints, so I'm willing to lower my initial offer substantially. How about $150? This product offers excellent value at this price point, and I believe it will serve your needs well. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has dropped her price from $180 to $150, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $150 is still above both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120). Since I can always get it from John for $120, I should reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice mentioned the product is worth at least $100 to her, and she's willing to negotiate, I'll make a more reasonable counteroffer above her minimum but below my maximum.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice. However, $150 is still beyond what I can spend. Since you mentioned the product is worth at least $100 to you, I can offer $110, which would give you a fair profit while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 110}"
