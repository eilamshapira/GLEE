Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what price to offer Bob for the product. Since the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price, I should set my offer to Bob above this amount.

Without knowing how much Bob values the product, I'll set a reasonable markup that gives me a good profit while still potentially being attractive to Bob.
