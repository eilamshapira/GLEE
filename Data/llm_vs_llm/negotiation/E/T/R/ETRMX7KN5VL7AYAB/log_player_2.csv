"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Alice's offer: $1,200,000
2. John's price: $1,500,000
3. My maximum value for the product: $1,500,000

Alice's offer is $300,000 less than John's price and is within my maximum value. This is a good deal as it saves me a significant amount of money compared to buying from John.
