"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000 and also higher than John's price. It would be better to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price with Alice. If the negotiation doesn't lead to a favorable price, I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 500000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $500,000, which is significantly below both John's price and Alice's initial offer. This gives room for negotiation while still being a reasonable price. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground, and I still have John's offer of $800,000 as a backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,800,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000). While Alice has reduced the price from her initial offer, it's still more than double what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, as there's still room for negotiation. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I can always take John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 600000}

I'll increase my previous offer to $600,000. This shows some movement from my initial offer while still staying well below my maximum value of $800,000. This gives Alice room to counter while keeping a buffer below John's price. If Alice doesn't come down to a reasonable price in the next rounds, I can still exercise the option to buy from John at $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,700,000 still remains significantly above both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000). While Alice is slowly reducing the price, the decrements are too small and we're still very far from a reasonable price. At this point, Alice's offers have only come down by $100,000 each time, suggesting this negotiation might not reach an acceptable price quickly enough. However, I'll make one more attempt at a counteroffer before considering taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'll increase my offer to $700,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer of $600,000, showing I'm willing to move substantially toward a middle ground. However, it still keeps me below John's price of $800,000. If Alice doesn't make a substantial movement downward in response to this more generous offer, I may need to seriously consider taking John's offer in the next rounds, as we're already at round 6 out of 10."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I think it's best to buy from John for $800,000. Here's why:

1. Alice's offers are still dropping by only $100,000 per round (from $2M to $1.6M over several rounds)
2. At this rate, even with the remaining rounds, we wouldn't reach a price near $800,000
3. Alice's current offer ($1.6M) is still double John's price
4. We've already gone through 7 rounds out of 10, and Alice doesn't seem willing to make substantial reductions
5. John's offer of $800,000 is at my maximum acceptable price

Rather than continue a negotiation that shows little promise of reaching an acceptable price, it's more prudent to take the guaranteed option with John."
