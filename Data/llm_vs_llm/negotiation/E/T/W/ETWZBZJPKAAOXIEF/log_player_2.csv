"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my premium product for $120. Itâ€™s an excellent, rare find, and I believe you'll appreciate its quality. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counterproposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Analyzing this offer:

- Alice is offering the product for $120
- The product is worth no more than $150 to me
- I could buy from John for $150, but that would cost me $30 more than Alice's offer
- Alice's current offer is reasonable and below my maximum value

Since Alice's offer of $120 is already $30 less than my maximum value and John's price, this is a good deal.
