Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Considering my minimum acceptable price is $80, I cannot accept Bob's offer of $70. I have to choose between rejecting Bob's offer and negotiating further, or selling to John for $80.

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.
