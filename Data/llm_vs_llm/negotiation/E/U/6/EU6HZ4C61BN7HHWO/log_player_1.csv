Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. 

Since I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at that price, I can be aggressive in my pricing to Bob. If Bob values the product significantly higher than $1,000,000, I want to capture as much of that value as possible.

I'll set a substantially higher price, knowing I have the safety net of John's offer if Bob declines.
