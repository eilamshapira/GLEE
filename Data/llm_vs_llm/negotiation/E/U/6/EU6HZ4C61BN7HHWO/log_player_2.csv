"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given the information provided, I'll analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me (Bob).
2. Alice is offering the product for $2,500,000.
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $1,000,000.

Since Alice's offer ($2,500,000) is much higher than both:
- The maximum value of the product to me ($1,000,000)
- John's alternative offer ($1,000,000)

The logical choice is to buy from John and pay exactly what the product is worth to me at maximum.
