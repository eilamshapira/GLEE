Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth and I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was thinking of a price around $800000. I understand the value of the product, but I need to consider my budget as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have a chance to negotiate a better price with Bob, and if that doesn't work out, I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000. 

My next offer will be: 
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your consideration of the product's value and your budget constraints. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,650,000. This price takes into account the product's exceptional worth and allows for some flexibility. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 1650000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I need to stay within my budget. I can offer $850000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I hope it shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly lower than the product's worth to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I appreciate the increase from his previous offer, but I believe there is still room for negotiation.

My next offer will be:
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate the increase in your offer and your commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to make a concession and offer the product for $1,600,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your concession, but I need to stay within my budget. I can offer $900000. This is another significant increase from my previous offer, and I hope it shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try to meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is still lower than the product's worth to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I appreciate the increase from his previous offer and his willingness to meet in the middle.

However, considering the significant gap between our prices, I'm starting to think that we might not reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll make one more concession, but if Bob doesn't meet me closer to my target price, I might consider selling to John.

My next offer will be:
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $1,550,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial price, and I hope it shows my willingness to meet you halfway.
