"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","The offer from Alice is $200, which is higher than the $120 that the product is worth to me. It's also higher than John's price of $120.

Since I can buy the product from John for $120, which matches the maximum I'm willing to pay, there's no reason to accept Alice's much higher offer of $200.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $150 is still higher than John's price of $120, and it's also higher than the maximum value of $120 that the product is worth to me.

Since I can buy the product from John for $120, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me, I should not accept Alice's higher offer of $150.
