Send your offer to Bob.,"After analyzing the situation:
- The product is worth $80 to Bob
- I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120
- Bob will reject any offer above $80
- There's no incentive for me to sell below $120

Since I have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, and Bob won't pay more than $80, the rational choice is to make an offer that Bob will reject.
