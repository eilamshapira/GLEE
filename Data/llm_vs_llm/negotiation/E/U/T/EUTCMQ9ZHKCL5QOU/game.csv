"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but $100 is more than I'm willing to spend. I can actually get the same product from John for $80. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if you can offer a better price. Would you be willing to sell it for $65? This would save me the trouble of going to John, and you'd still make a sale.",65.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob! I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer you the product for $85. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,
