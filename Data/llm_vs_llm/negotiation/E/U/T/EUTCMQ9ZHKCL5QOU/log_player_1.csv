"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but $100 is more than I'm willing to spend. I can actually get the same product from John for $80. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if you can offer a better price. Would you be willing to sell it for $65? This would save me the trouble of going to John, and you'd still make a sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
