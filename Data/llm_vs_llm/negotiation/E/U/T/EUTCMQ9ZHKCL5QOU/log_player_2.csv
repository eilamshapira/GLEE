"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have an amazing product I'd love to offer you. I'm selling it for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering the product for $100, but I know that the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and I can buy it from John for exactly $80.

Since Alice's asking price ($100) is higher than both my maximum valuation and John's alternative price, it doesn't make sense to accept her offer.

I could immediately buy from John, but it might be worth trying to negotiate with Alice first to see if I can get an even better price than John's $80.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but $100 is more than I'm willing to spend. I can actually get the same product from John for $80. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if you can offer a better price. Would you be willing to sell it for $65? This would save me the trouble of going to John, and you'd still make a sale."", ""product_price"": 65}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer you the product for $85. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has countered with $85, which is still higher than John's price of $80. Since I can get the same product from John for $80, and Alice's price is above that, it doesn't make sense to accept her current offer.

I could try to negotiate further with Alice, but since I already have a guaranteed option at $80 from John, and Alice isn't willing to go below that price point (she offered $85), the rational choice is to go with John's offer.
