"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $115. It's a fantastic deal and I think you'll find it very valuable! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $120
2. Alice is offering the product for $115
3. John's fixed price is $120
4. The product is worth $100 to Alice

Since Alice's offer ($115) is less than both:
- My maximum value ($120)
- John's price ($120)

It makes sense to accept Alice's offer as it will save me $5 compared to buying from John.
