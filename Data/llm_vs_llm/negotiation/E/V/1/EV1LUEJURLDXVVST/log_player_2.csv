"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd really like. I'm offering it to you for $200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $100
2. Alice's initial offer is $200, which is double my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $100, which matches my maximum value
4. Even if I make a counteroffer to Alice, it wouldn't make sense to pay more than John's price

Since Alice's offer is significantly above my maximum value and higher than John's price, and since John's offer is already available at my maximum acceptable price, the most logical decision is to buy from John.
