"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $1,500,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a high offer to Bob to see if there's potential for a deal above John's price.

{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and even below his own valuation ($800,000), and I have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,500,000, the rational choice is to end the negotiation with Bob and sell to John.
