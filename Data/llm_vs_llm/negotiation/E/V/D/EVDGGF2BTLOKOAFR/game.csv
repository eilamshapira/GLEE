"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Considering its exclusivity and features, I'm offering it to you for $25000.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's exclusivity, $25000 is significantly beyond my budget. The maximum I'm willing to pay is $4000, which I believe is fair considering market alternatives. John is offering the same product for $8000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement.",4000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints. However, the product's value and features are truly exceptional. Considering the market and the product's unique aspects, I'm willing to lower my price to $22000. I believe this is a fair price for such a valuable item.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $22000 is still far above what I can justify spending. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and that's exactly what John is offering. To give you an advantage over the competition, I'm willing to pay $5000. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to John. If we can't reach an agreement closer to my budget, I'll unfortunately need to pursue the alternative option.",5000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have other options, but I believe my product offers superior value. Considering its uniqueness and features, I'm willing to meet you halfway and lower the price to $18000. This price reflects the product's quality and the exclusive experience it offers. I am sure that John's offer is for an inferior product. What do you say?",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation and your point about potential quality differences. However, I need to be clear that the product is worth no more than $8000 to me - that's my absolute ceiling, and it happens to be exactly what John is charging. I understand you believe your product is superior, but I can't justify paying more than double what an alternative would cost me. My highest offer is $6000, which still gives you a premium over what I consider the market value. If we can't reach an agreement near this range, I'll need to go with John's offer.",6000.0,Bob,6,
