Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Considering its exclusivity and features, I'm offering it to you for $25,000."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's exclusivity, $25000 is significantly beyond my budget. The maximum I'm willing to pay is $4000, which I believe is fair considering market alternatives. John is offering the same product for $8000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a tricky situation. Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I need to make a profit. However, his mention of John offering the product for $8000 suggests the product could be worth more to him than his initial offer. I want to maximize my earnings.

Considering all the information, I will:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints. However, the product's value and features are truly exceptional. Considering the market and the product's unique aspects, I'm willing to lower my price to $22,000. I believe this is a fair price for such a valuable item."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $22000 is still far above what I can justify spending. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and that's exactly what John is offering. To give you an advantage over the competition, I'm willing to pay $5000. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to John. If we can't reach an agreement closer to my budget, I'll unfortunately need to pursue the alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Okay, this is a tough one. Bob is clearly trying to lowball me, and his offer is still below my minimum. He also strongly hints at going with John. But I still need to make the best decision for myself.

Considering my $15,000 minimum, Bob's offer is way too low. Rejecting gives me another shot at a higher price, or I can sell to John. Given that, I will:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have other options, but I believe my product offers superior value. Considering its uniqueness and features, I'm willing to meet you halfway and lower the price to $18,000. This price reflects the product's quality and the exclusive experience it offers. I am sure that John's offer is for an inferior product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation and your point about potential quality differences. However, I need to be clear that the product is worth no more than $8000 to me - that's my absolute ceiling, and it happens to be exactly what John is charging. I understand you believe your product is superior, but I can't justify paying more than double what an alternative would cost me. My highest offer is $6000, which still gives you a premium over what I consider the market value. If we can't reach an agreement near this range, I'll need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is the moment of truth. Bob is very close to the price John is offering, but still not within my acceptable range. He is clearly bluffing about his absolute ceiling, but the risk of not selling to anyone is real. However, I have to make more than $15,000. So, I will:
