You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given the information, Alice is offering the product for $25,000, which is significantly higher than your maximum valuation of $8,000. Also, you have the option to buy the same product from John for exactly $8,000.

Since Alice's offer ($25,000) is much higher than your maximum valuation ($8,000) and higher than John's guaranteed price ($8,000), it makes financial sense to reject this offer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints. However, the product's value and features are truly exceptional. Considering the market and the product's unique aspects, I'm willing to lower my price to $22000. I believe this is a fair price for such a valuable item.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price slightly to $22,000, but this is still substantially higher than both my maximum valuation of $8,000 and John's guaranteed price of $8,000. Since Alice's current offer is not economically beneficial for me, I'll reject it and continue negotiating.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $22,000 is still far above what I can justify spending. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and that's exactly what John is offering. To give you an advantage over the competition, I'm willing to pay $5,000. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to John. If we can't reach an agreement closer to my budget, I'll unfortunately need to pursue the alternative option."", ""product_price"": 5000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have other options, but I believe my product offers superior value. Considering its uniqueness and features, I'm willing to meet you halfway and lower the price to $18000. This price reflects the product's quality and the exclusive experience it offers. I am sure that John's offer is for an inferior product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has lowered her price to $18,000, but this is still more than double my maximum valuation of $8,000 and John's guaranteed price. Even if Alice's product has some superior features as she claims, the price difference remains too significant to justify accepting her offer.

Given that I can get the product from John for $8,000 (which is my maximum valuation for the product), and Alice's price is still far above this amount, I'll reject her current offer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation and your point about potential quality differences. However, I need to be clear that the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me - that's my absolute ceiling, and it happens to be exactly what John is charging. I understand you believe your product is superior, but I can't justify paying more than double what an alternative would cost me. My highest offer is $6,000, which still gives you a premium over what I consider the market value. If we can't reach an agreement near this range, I'll need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
