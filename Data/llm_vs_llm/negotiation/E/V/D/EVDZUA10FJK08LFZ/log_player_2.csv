"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $1,450,000, I need to decide if I should accept it.

The product is worth up to $1,500,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $1,450,000, which is $50,000 less than my maximum valuation.

If I reject Alice's offer, my only alternative is to buy from John for $1,500,000, which would cost me $50,000 more than Alice's offer.

Since Alice's offer allows me to save $50,000 compared to buying from John, the rational decision is to accept Alice's offer.
