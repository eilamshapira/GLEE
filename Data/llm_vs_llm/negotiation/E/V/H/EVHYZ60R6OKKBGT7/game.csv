"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, $15000 is well above my budget. I can see that your product is of good quality, but I have another seller offering me the same product for $12000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you consider $10500 for the product? This would give me some savings compared to my alternative option while still providing you with a reasonable sale.",10500.0,Bob,2,
