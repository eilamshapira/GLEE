Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it for $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, $15000 is well above my budget. I can see that your product is of good quality, but I have another seller offering me the same product for $12000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you consider $10500 for the product? This would give me some savings compared to my alternative option while still providing you with a reasonable sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
