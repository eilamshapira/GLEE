"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it for $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $15,000, but I know the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me. John is willing to sell me the same product for $12,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's offer exceeds my valuation and I have a guaranteed alternative at my maximum price point, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. If negotiations with Alice don't work out, I can always buy from John at $12,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, $15,000 is well above my budget. I can see that your product is of good quality, but I have another seller offering me the same product for $12,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you consider $10,500 for the product? This would give me some savings compared to my alternative option while still providing you with a reasonable sale."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
