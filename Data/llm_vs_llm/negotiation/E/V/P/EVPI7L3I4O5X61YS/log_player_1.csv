Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a profit on this product, but I also need to be strategic about my pricing. If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell to John for $100, which is my minimum acceptable value.

Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, I can offer him a price that gives him some value while maximizing my profit. If I price it too high, Bob might reject it. A reasonable approach would be to offer Bob a slight discount from his maximum value, allowing him to feel he's getting some benefit while I earn more than my alternative option.
