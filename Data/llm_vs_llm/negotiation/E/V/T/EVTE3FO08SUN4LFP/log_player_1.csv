Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, I'll start by making an initial offer.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","This is tricky. $60 is far less than I want. My profit is only $60 if I accept his offer. Selling to John guarantees me $120.
