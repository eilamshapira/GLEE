Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make an offer to Bob for a product that is worth at least $800,000 to me and $1,200,000 to Bob. If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell to John for $800,000.

Given this situation, I want to set a price that maximizes my profit while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept. Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, any price below that could potentially be acceptable to him. However, I need to balance between getting close to Bob's maximum value and not risking rejection.

A reasonable strategy would be to offer the product at a price that gives Bob some surplus value while still being significantly better for me than my fallback option of $800,000.
