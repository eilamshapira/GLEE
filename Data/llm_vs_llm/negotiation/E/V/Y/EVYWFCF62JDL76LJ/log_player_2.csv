"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given the information, I need to evaluate which option is most beneficial for me.

- Alice is offering the product for $1,050,000
- The product is worth up to $1,200,000 to me
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $1,200,000

Since Alice's offer ($1,050,000) is less than John's price ($1,200,000), and both are within my maximum valuation, I should accept Alice's offer to save $150,000.
