"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the discount from the standard $10000 price, I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial arrangement. The product is worth $8000 to you, and I'm looking for a fair deal. I'd like to offer $8500 for the product, which gives you a $500 profit and saves me a significant amount compared to John's price.",8500.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $9000, which still offers you a good deal while ensuring a fair profit for me. What do you say?",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see your point, but I think we can find a middle ground. How about we settle at $8800? This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and should be a good value for you while still being fair to me.",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for working with me on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. Your new offer is definitely much better. To meet you halfway from my previous offer, I'm willing to pay $8650 for the product. This gives you a reasonable profit of $650 while still giving me a good discount compared to John's price. I think this is fair for both of us.",8650.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle. However, I believe we can still find a price that works better for both of us. How about we settle at $8750? This is closer to your offer and still provides you with a good deal while ensuring I get a fair return on the product.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer to an agreement. To further narrow the gap, I'm willing to lower the price to $8700. This should be a good compromise, giving you a substantial discount while still allowing me a fair profit. What do you think?",8700.0,Alice,5,
