Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the discount from the standard $10000 price, I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial arrangement.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

# Bob's message: Thanks for working with me on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. Your new offer is definitely much better. To meet you halfway from my previous offer, I'm willing to pay $8650 for the product. This gives you a reasonable profit of $650 while still giving me a good discount compared to John's price. I think this is fair for both of us.
