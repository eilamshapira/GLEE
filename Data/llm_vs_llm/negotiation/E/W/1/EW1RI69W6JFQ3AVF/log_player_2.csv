"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $9500. This is a great opportunity to get a high-value item at a competitive rate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I notice that Alice is offering me the product for $9,500, which is less than John's price of $10,000. However, I know the product is only worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the discount from the standard $10,000 price, I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial arrangement. The product is worth $8,000 to you, and I'm looking for a fair deal. I'd like to offer $8,500 for the product, which gives you a $500 profit and saves me a significant amount compared to John's price."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see your point, but I think we can find a middle ground. How about we settle at $8800? This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and should be a good value for you while still being fair to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has come down significantly from her initial $9,500 offer to $8,800, which is much better. Since she's moved $700 from her initial offer and is now only $800 above her cost, I could accept this. However, I think there's still room for one more counter to find a better middle ground.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for working with me on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. Your new offer is definitely much better. To meet you halfway from my previous offer, I'm willing to pay $8,650 for the product. This gives you a reasonable profit of $650 while still giving me a good discount compared to John's price. I think this is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8650}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer to an agreement. To further narrow the gap, I'm willing to lower the price to $8700. This should be a good compromise, giving you a substantial discount while still allowing me a fair profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has come down to $8,700, which is just $50 above my last offer of $8,650. She's showing willingness to compromise, and we're now negotiating over a relatively small amount. At this point, continuing to negotiate for a minor difference might risk unnecessarily prolonging the negotiation, and the current offer is already $1,300 below John's price.
