"Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to start the bidding at $200. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is well above what I'm looking to spend on this product. I know I can get the same product elsewhere for $120. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. I'm willing to offer $100 for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I understand you can find similar products for a lower price, but I believe mine offers unique value. How about we meet in the middle at $170?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that, but $170 is still significantly more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I can get this product for $120 elsewhere, which is honestly the maximum I'm willing to pay. To make it worth buying from you instead, I'd need to get it for less. I can offer you $110. This would save me a bit compared to my other option while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, but I need to be closer to my original price to make this worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $155, my final offer. This is a very fair price considering the quality and value I'm offering.  Let me know if this works for you.",155.0,Alice,5,
