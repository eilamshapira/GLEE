Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is well above what I'm looking to spend on this product. I know I can get the same product elsewhere for $120. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. I'm willing to offer $100 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I understand you can find similar products for a lower price, but I believe mine offers unique value. How about we meet in the middle at $170?"", ""product_price"": 170}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that, but $170 is still significantly more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I can get this product for $120 elsewhere, which is honestly the maximum I'm willing to pay. To make it worth buying from you instead, I'd need to get it for less. I can offer you $110. This would save me a bit compared to my other option while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point, but I need to be closer to my original price to make this worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $155, my final offer.
