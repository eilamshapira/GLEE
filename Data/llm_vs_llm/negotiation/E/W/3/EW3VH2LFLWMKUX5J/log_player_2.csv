"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to start the bidding at $200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $200 against my other options. The product is worth no more than $120 to me, and I can buy it from John for $120 at any time. Alice's offer of $200 significantly exceeds both the product's value to me and John's price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is well above what I'm looking to spend on this product. I know I can get the same product elsewhere for $120. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. I'm willing to offer $100 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I understand you can find similar products for a lower price, but I believe mine offers unique value. How about we meet in the middle at $170? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has come down from $200 to $170, but this is still higher than both the product's value to me and John's price of $120. Since I can get the product for $120 from John, and that's exactly what the product is worth to me at maximum, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $170.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that, but $170 is still significantly more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I can get this product for $120 elsewhere, which is honestly the maximum I'm willing to pay. To make it worth buying from you instead, I'd need to get it for less. I can offer you $110. This would save me a bit compared to my other option while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point, but I need to be closer to my original price to make this worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $155, my final offer. This is a very fair price considering the quality and value I'm offering.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has lowered her price to $155, but this is still $35 more than I can buy the same product from John ($120). Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and I can buy it for exactly that price from John, there's no reason for me to accept Alice's offer of $155.
