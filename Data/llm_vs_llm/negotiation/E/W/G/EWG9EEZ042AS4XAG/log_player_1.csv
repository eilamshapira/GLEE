Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this exclusive product. I believe it will be a great asset for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,500."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm aiming to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $13000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Okay, given Bob's counteroffer of $13,000, I have a decision to make. Selling for $13,000 would give me a profit of $1,000, which is better than selling to John for $12,000. However, I also know Bob values the product at $15,000. I want to maximize my profit. I'll try for a higher price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:
