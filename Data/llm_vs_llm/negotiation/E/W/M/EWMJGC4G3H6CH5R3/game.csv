"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $11500 is higher than I was expecting to pay. The product is worth around $8000-$9000 in the current market. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it, which gives you a fair profit while also being reasonable for me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering the product's value and potential benefits to your business, how about we settle at $10800? I believe this price still offers you excellent value.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that, but $10800 is still quite high compared to the product's market value. I understand you need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9500. This gives you a $1500 profit margin while also being reasonable for my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
