Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering the product at a fair price considering its value and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $11,500?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $11500 is higher than I was expecting to pay. The product is worth around $8000-$9000 in the current market. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it, which gives you a fair profit while also being reasonable for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that, but $10800 is still quite high compared to the product's market value. I understand you need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9500. This gives you a $1500 profit margin while also being reasonable for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.
