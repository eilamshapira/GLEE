"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering the product at a fair price considering its value and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $11500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's offer of $11,500 is quite high, especially considering the product is worth only $8,000 to her. While it's below the $12,000 maximum I'd be willing to pay, I can likely negotiate a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $11,500 is higher than I was expecting to pay. The product is worth around $8,000-$9,000 in the current market. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it, which gives you a fair profit while also being reasonable for me."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering the product's value and potential benefits to your business, how about we settle at $10800? I believe this price still offers you excellent value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has come down from $11,500 to $10,800, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still quite high compared to her cost of $8,000. I can continue negotiating to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that, but $10,800 is still quite high compared to the product's market value. I understand you need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,500. This gives you a $1,500 profit margin while also being reasonable for my budget."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
