"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out about this product. While $14000 is below my maximum budget, I've done some market research and believe a fair price would be closer to $10000, which still provides you with a good profit margin. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Okay, here's what I'll do. I need to maximize my profit, and I know the product is worth at least $8,000 to me. $10,000 is a good profit!
