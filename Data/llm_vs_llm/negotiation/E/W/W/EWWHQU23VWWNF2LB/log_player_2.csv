"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's a unique opportunity that aligns perfectly with your needs. I'm offering it to you for $1600000. This is a fair price, considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer is over your budget and John is offering the product for less.  It makes the most sense to buy from John in this scenario."
