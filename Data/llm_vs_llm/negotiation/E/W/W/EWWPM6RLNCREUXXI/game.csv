"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $8000 for it. Can we discuss further?",8000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $8000 is below our minimum acceptable price. I can go as low as $13000 for this premium product. Let me know if this works for you.",13000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12500? This is the best I can do while still maintaining the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. Can you consider my offer?",9500.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9500 is still below our minimum threshold. I can lower my price to $12000, which is the lowest I can go. Please let me know if this works for you.",12000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. My final offer is $12000, which is the absolute lowest I can go. This is a great deal for a product of this quality. Let me know if you can accept this price.",12000.0,Alice,5,
