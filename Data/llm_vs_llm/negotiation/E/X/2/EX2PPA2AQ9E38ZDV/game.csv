"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm confident will provide great value. I'm offering it to you for $20000. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand that the product is of high quality, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a reasonable price, but I need to consider my financial constraints. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $10000 is below what I can accept for this product. I have another buyer willing to pay $12000, but I believe this product would be more valuable to you. I can reduce my initial asking price to $16000, which is a significant reduction and reflects the true value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price to $16000. However, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering you have another buyer willing to pay $12000, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $11500. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",11500.0,Bob,4,
