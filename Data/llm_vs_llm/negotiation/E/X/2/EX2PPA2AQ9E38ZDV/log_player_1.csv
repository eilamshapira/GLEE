"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm confident will provide great value. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand that the product is of high quality, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a reasonable price, but I need to consider my financial constraints. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and I can get that amount from John. However, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at a higher price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $10,000 is below what I can accept for this product. I have another buyer willing to pay $12,000, but I believe this product would be more valuable to you. I can reduce my initial asking price to $16,000, which is a significant reduction and reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price to $16000. However, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering you have another buyer willing to pay $12000, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $11500. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below what John is willing to pay ($12,000), and Bob's incremental increase suggests he might not be willing to go much higher, I'll take the guaranteed $12,000 from John. This ensures I get more than Bob's current offer and eliminates the risk of further negotiation rounds that might not lead to a better outcome."
