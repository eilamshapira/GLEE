Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make an offer that is more attractive than my fallback option of selling to John for $1,200,000, while maximizing my profit.

Since I know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, I should set my offer to Bob at a higher price. Without knowing how much Bob values the product, I'll set a price that gives me a reasonable profit margin while still potentially being attractive to Bob.
