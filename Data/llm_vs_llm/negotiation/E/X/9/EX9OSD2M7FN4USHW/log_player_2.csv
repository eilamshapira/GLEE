"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $1,650,000, which is higher than my maximum budget, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,500,000.
