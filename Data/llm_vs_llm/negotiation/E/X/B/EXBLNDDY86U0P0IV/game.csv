"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was thinking of a much lower price. How about $40?",40.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $40 is significantly below the value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground - would you consider $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still too high for me. I can increase my offer to $50. How about that?",50.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a price that works, but my goal is to be fair to both of us. This product offers significant value, and $50 is simply too low.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $120, my final offer.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand where you're coming from, but $120 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to raise my offer to $60. If this doesn't work for you, I might have to explore other options.",60.0,Bob,6,
