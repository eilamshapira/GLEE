"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $180, which reflects its true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Let's start negotiating. Alice's initial price of $180 is more than double what I'm willing to pay.)

**Counteroffer:**
Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was thinking of a much lower price. I can offer you $40 for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was thinking of a much lower price. How about $40?"", ""product_price"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $40 is significantly below the value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground - would you consider $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Alice's counteroffer of $140 is still much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll make another counteroffer.)

**Counteroffer:**
Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still too high for me. I can increase my offer to $50. How about that?"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still too high for me. I can increase my offer to $50. How about that?"", ""product_price"": 50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a price that works, but my goal is to be fair to both of us. This product offers significant value, and $50 is simply too low.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $120, my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Alice's offer is still too high, and she claims it's her final offer. I'll make another counteroffer, but I'm also considering John's offer more seriously now.)

**Counteroffer:**
Hi Alice, I understand where you're coming from, but $120 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to raise my offer to $60. If this doesn't work for you, I might have to explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
