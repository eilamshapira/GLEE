"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $150. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer of $150 is higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100), it doesn't make sense to accept this offer. While I could make a counteroffer, I already know that John is willing to sell at $100, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. There's no guarantee that negotiating with Alice will result in a better price, especially since the product is worth $150 to her. The rational choice is to buy from John.
