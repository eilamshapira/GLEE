Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this:

1. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob
2. My minimum acceptable price is $800,000
3. If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed $800,000 from John
4. Bob would be better off accepting any price below $1,200,000
5. I should price high but give Bob enough incentive to accept
