"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Alice's offer: $1,050,000
2. John's price: $1,200,000
3. My maximum value: $1,200,000

Alice's offer is $150,000 less than John's price, and it's within my maximum value of $1,200,000. This represents a significant saving compared to buying from John. While Alice might be making a good profit (considering her cost is $800,000), the price is still reasonable from my perspective.
