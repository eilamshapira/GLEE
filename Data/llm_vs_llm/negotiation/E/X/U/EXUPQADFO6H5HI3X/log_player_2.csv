"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at $300, which is a fair price considering its quality and utility. Please let me know if you're interested in purchasing it at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's asking price of $300 is significantly higher than the maximum value of $80 that this product is worth to me. It's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $80. There's no reason for me to accept this offer or even continue negotiating from such a high starting point when I have a guaranteed option at my maximum value.
