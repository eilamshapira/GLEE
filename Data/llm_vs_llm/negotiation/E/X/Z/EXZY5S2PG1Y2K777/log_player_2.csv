"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($15,000) and John's alternative price ($15,000). It would be irrational to accept this offer when I have a guaranteed option at $15,000. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 12000}

I'll offer $12,000, which is below John's price of $15,000. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Alice, this offer still allows her to make a profit of $3,000. This leaves room for negotiation while trying to secure a better deal than John's alternative offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $24,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $24,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $24,000 is still significantly higher than John's price of $15,000. While she has reduced the price by $1,000, it's still not a competitive offer compared to my alternative option. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round, as there's still room for negotiation to reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 13500}

I'll increase my offer to $13,500, which is still below John's price of $15,000 but represents a significant increase from my previous offer. This price would give Alice a $1,500 profit from her cost basis and might be more appealing to her. It also saves me $1,500 compared to buying from John, so it's a win-win proposition."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $23,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $23,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $23,000 is still much higher than John's price of $15,000. While she continues to lower her price, the current offer would mean paying $8,000 more than necessary. Since we still have rounds remaining and John's offer serves as a reliable backup option, I'll reject and make another counteroffer to try to reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 14000}

I'll increase my offer to $14,000, which is very close to John's price but still saves me $1,000. This is a strong offer for Alice as it would give her a $1,000 profit from her cost basis. Since we're in round 6 now, I want to show I'm serious about making a deal by making a more attractive offer, while still maintaining some advantage over John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Alice continues to offer prices significantly above John's $15,000 price, and even though she's gradually reducing her price, we're in round 7 and she's still asking for $7,000 more than John's price. Since the product is only worth $15,000 to me, and John offers exactly that price, it makes more sense to end the negotiation and take John's guaranteed offer rather than continue this pattern of high counteroffers from Alice."
