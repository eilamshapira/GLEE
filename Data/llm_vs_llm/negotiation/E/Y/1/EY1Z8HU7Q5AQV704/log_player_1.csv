"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I certainly understand that $20,000 might be too high, but $12,000 is below the value that I can already get from another buyer. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $17,000? This way, both of us can walk away feeling good about the deal."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

I'm afraid we couldn't reach an agreement that benefits both parties. I have another buyer willing to pay $15,000, so I will sell the product to them. Thank you for your time, Bob. If you are looking for this type of product again, please contact me."
