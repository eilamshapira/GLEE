,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $18000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. The product is only worth about $10000 to me based on my research, and I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $12000. I'd like to work with you, but I need a better price. I can offer $9000 for the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $9000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price. I understand your position, but the product's value to us is no less than $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $16500. This is a fair price considering the value and quality of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",16500.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given your budget constraints and the value you've mentioned, I can lower the price to $16000. This is the best I can do while still maintaining the value of the product for us. Let me know if this revised offer works for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for lowering your price, Alice, but $16000 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I have another seller offering the same product for $12000, which is really my maximum budget for this purchase. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer $10500 for the product. This gives you a better deal than my initial offer while still being reasonable for my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10500 is still below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $15500, which is very close to the value of the product to us and should be a fair compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",15500.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're still a bit apart on the price. I'm willing to go down to $15250, which is the lowest I can go while still respecting the value of the product to us. This should be a good compromise given your budget and the other offer you mentioned. Let me know if this works for you.",15250.0,Alice,5,
