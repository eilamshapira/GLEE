Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $18000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. The product is only worth about $10000 to me based on my research, and I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $12000. I'd like to work with you, but I need a better price. I can offer $9000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $9,000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price. I understand your position, but the product's value to us is no less than $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $16,500. This is a fair price considering the value and quality of the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 16500}"

Round 3

This is the best I can do while still maintaining the value of the product for us. Let me know if this revised offer works for you."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for lowering your price, Alice, but $16000 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I have another seller offering the same product for $12000, which is really my maximum budget for this purchase. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer $10500 for the product. This gives you a better deal than my initial offer while still being reasonable for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I see we're still a bit apart on the price.
