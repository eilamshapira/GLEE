Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $100. Since selling to John for $100 is a better option than selling to Bob for $85, I will not accept Bob's offer.

I will reject Bob's offer, but I will also consider the fact that I have 6 more rounds to negotiate. I might be able to get a better offer from Bob in the future rounds.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, but it's still $5 less than what I can get from John. Since I have 4 more rounds to negotiate, I might be able to get an even better offer from Bob.

However, considering that Bob's offer is very close to my minimum value, and the risk of not getting a better offer in the next rounds, I think it's time to consider selling to John.
