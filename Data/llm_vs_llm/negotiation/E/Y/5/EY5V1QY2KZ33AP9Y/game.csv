"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I think $1100000 is a bit high. Given market conditions, I would be comfortable paying $1040000 for the product. This still gives you a good profit margin while being more aligned with my budget. What do you think?",1040000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $1040000, but I believe we can find a better middle ground. How about I offer you the product for $1080000? I think this price reflects the value of the product while still being a good deal for you. Let me know your thoughts!",1080000.0,Alice,3,
