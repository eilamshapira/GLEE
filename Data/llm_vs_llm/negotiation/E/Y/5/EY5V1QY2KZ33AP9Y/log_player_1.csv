Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I think $1100000 is a bit high. Given market conditions, I would be comfortable paying $1040000 for the product. This still gives you a good profit margin while being more aligned with my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,040,000.
