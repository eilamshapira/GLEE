"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,200,000
2. Alice's offer is $1,100,000
3. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice
4. John's fixed price is $1,200,000

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is already $100,000 below my maximum value, but since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, there might be room for negotiation. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as:
- It's better than John's price ($1,200,000)
- There's potential to negotiate further down from $1,100,000
- Alice has room to reduce the price since her value is $1,000,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but gives me more savings:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I think $1,100,000 is a bit high. Given market conditions, I would be comfortable paying $1,040,000 for the product. This still gives you a good profit margin while being more aligned with my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1040000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $1040000, but I believe we can find a better middle ground. How about I offer you the product for $1080000? I think this price reflects the value of the product while still being a good deal for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's initial offer was $1,100,000
2. My counteroffer was $1,040,000
3. Alice's new offer is $1,080,000
4. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice
5. John's price remains at $1,200,000

Alice has moved down $20,000 from her initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate. The current offer of $1,080,000 is:
- $120,000 less than John's price
- $80,000 above Alice's value
- A reasonable movement from her initial position

While we might get a slightly better price with another round of negotiation, the current price is quite good, and there's a risk of prolonging negotiations unnecessarily. The savings of $120,000 compared to John's price is significant.
