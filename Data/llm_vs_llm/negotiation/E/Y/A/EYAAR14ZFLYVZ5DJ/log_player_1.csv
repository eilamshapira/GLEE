Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $120 to Bob
2. The product is worth at least $80 to me
3. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $80
4. Bob knows I have another buyer, which gives me leverage
5. Bob would accept any price below $120 (his maximum value)

I'll offer a price that's high enough to maximize my profit but low enough that Bob should still accept, given that it saves him some value compared to his maximum price.
