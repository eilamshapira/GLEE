"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the options:

1. Alice's offer: $110
2. John's price: $120
3. My maximum value: $120

Alice's offer ($110) is better than John's price ($120), as it saves me $10. Since the price is also below my maximum value of $120, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer.
