Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll craft an offer to Bob considering our situation.

Bob values the product at $15,000, so any price below that could potentially be accepted by him. If he rejects my offer, I still have John's guaranteed offer of $12,000.

I should aim for a price that gives Bob some value while maximizing my profit. If I price too close to $15,000, Bob might reject the offer, but if I price too low, I'm leaving money on the table.

A reasonable approach would be to offer a price that splits the difference between my minimum ($12,000) and Bob's maximum ($15,000), but leaning more toward Bob's maximum since I have a guaranteed alternative.
