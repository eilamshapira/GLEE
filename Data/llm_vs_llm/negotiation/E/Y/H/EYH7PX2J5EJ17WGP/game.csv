"Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its superior quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $20000. This is a competitive price for the value you'll receive. Would you be interested in making this purchase?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Based on my budget and market research, I'm willing to offer $4000 for the product. Would you be open to this price?",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $4000 is far too low for this product. Given its quality and market value, I cannot go below $17500. I've reduced the price from my initial offer to show my willingness to negotiate, but please understand that the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that we're still far apart on the price, but I'm committed to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Based on my budget and the product's market value, I'm willing to offer $6000 for the product. Would you be open to considering this price?",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your increased offer, Bob, and your willingness to negotiate. However, $6000 is still well below the product's value. I can come down to $15000, which represents a significant reduction from my initial asking price. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still giving you a good deal. Would you consider this offer?",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"To further show my good faith in these negotiations, I'm willing to raise my offer to $7500. This is very close to my maximum budget, so I hope we can find an agreement at this price point. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,6,
