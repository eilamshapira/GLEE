"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its superior quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $20,000. This is a competitive price for the value you'll receive. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Based on my budget and market research, I'm willing to offer $4000 for the product. Would you be open to this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $4,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but will aim to negotiate towards a more reasonable price point. If we can't reach an agreement closer to my target price, I always have the option to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $4,000 is far too low for this product. Given its quality and market value, I cannot go below $17,500. I've reduced the price from my initial offer to show my willingness to negotiate, but please understand that the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're still far apart on the price, but I'm committed to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Based on my budget and the product's market value, I'm willing to offer $6000 for the product. Would you be open to considering this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $6,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While he has increased his offer, we're still too far apart. I'll make another counteroffer, but if we can't move closer to a reasonable price point soon, I may need to consider John's guaranteed offer of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your increased offer, Bob, and your willingness to negotiate. However, $6,000 is still well below the product's value. I can come down to $15,000, which represents a significant reduction from my initial asking price. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still giving you a good deal. Would you consider this offer?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: To further show my good faith in these negotiations, I'm willing to raise my offer to $7500. This is very close to my maximum budget, so I hope we can find an agreement at this price point. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Given that Bob's offers have been consistently well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and his latest offer of $7,500 suggests he's near his maximum budget, it's unlikely we'll reach a price point that works for both of us. Since John is willing to pay $12,000, which meets my minimum requirement, it's best to conclude the negotiation with Bob and accept John's offer."
