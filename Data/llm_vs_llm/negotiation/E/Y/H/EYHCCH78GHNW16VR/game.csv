"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate you taking the time to consider the product. While $10000 is lower than I can accept, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $16500?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the new offer, Alice. I understand you need to make a profit, but $16500 is still too high for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to go up to $11000. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,4,
