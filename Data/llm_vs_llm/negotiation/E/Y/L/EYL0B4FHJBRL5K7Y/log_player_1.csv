Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Anchoring High:** I'm starting significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and also above Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This is a negotiation tactic to set a high anchor. Even if Bob rejects this, it might influence his subsequent offers to be higher than they initially would have been.
*   **Room to Negotiate:** The significant difference between my initial price and my minimum price leaves a lot of room for negotiation.
*   **Testing Bob's Interest:** This price will immediately tell me how serious Bob is about acquiring the product. If he outright rejects it without a counter, it might indicate he's not as interested, and I can consider moving on to John sooner.
*   **Potential Upside:** While Bob values it at $8,000, there's a small chance he's willing to pay more if he REALLY wants the product. This opening offer tests that possibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
*   Selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed outcome. I need to believe I can extract *more* than $12,000 from Bob to justify continuing negotiations.
*   Rejecting the offer and sending a counteroffer provides the potential to find a price above $12,000.

I will prepare a counteroffer for the next turn."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Above John's Offer:** My primary goal is to beat John's offer of $12,000. This counteroffer accomplishes that.
*   **Significant Concession:** This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate significantly from my initial high price.
*   **Reasonable Price:** $13,500 is still a substantial amount, but perhaps palatable enough for Bob, considering he likely has a budget or perceived value in mind.
*   **Further Negotiation Room:** I still have some room to move down if needed (down to $12,000), but I'm aiming for a higher profit.
*   **Avoiding a Standoff:** If I only come down a small amount, Bob might walk away. This is a meaningful step down to keep him engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **$9,000 is unacceptable:** It's far below my minimum of $12,000.
*   **Bob is not budging enough:** His increase of only $1,000 from his initial offer suggests he is unlikely to reach my target price through further negotiation. He started at $8,000 and is only at $9,000. At this pace, getting above $12,000 is unlikely.
*   **John's offer is guaranteed and time-sensitive:** I don't know how long John will be willing to pay $12,000. It's safer to accept the guaranteed profit.
*   **Risk vs. Reward:** The risk of further negotiation (which is unlikely to yield a substantial increase based on Bob's behavior) is not worth the guaranteed $12,000 from John. I'm cutting my losses and securing a solid deal."
