"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $15000 is above my budget for this product. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $8500 for the product?",8500.0,Bob,2,
