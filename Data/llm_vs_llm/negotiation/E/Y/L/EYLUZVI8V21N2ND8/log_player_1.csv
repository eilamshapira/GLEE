"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $15000 is above my budget for this product. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $8500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
