# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe you'll find invaluable. I'm offering it to you for $15000. Let me know if you're interested!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","The offer from Alice is $15,000, which is higher than what the product is worth to me (no more than $10,000) and also higher than John's guaranteed price of $10,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $15,000 is above my budget for this product. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $10,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $8,500 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"
