Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1250000}

Bob, this is a fair offer, and we're getting very close to a price that works for both of us. I'm confident this product will bring you considerable value, and I'm willing to make this concession to close the deal."

This offer is above my minimum, and while I could push for more, it's getting late in the negotiation.  Better to take a sure win now than risk it for a slightly higher price."
