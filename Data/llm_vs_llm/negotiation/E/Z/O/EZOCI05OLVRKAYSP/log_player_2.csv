"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. Alice is offering the product for $250
3. John is willing to sell it for $150

Since Alice's offer ($250) is significantly higher than both:
- My maximum value ($150)
- John's alternative price ($150)

It makes no economic sense to accept Alice's offer. The rational choice would be to buy from John for $150.
