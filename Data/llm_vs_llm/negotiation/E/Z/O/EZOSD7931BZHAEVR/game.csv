"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2000000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800000 at this time. This reflects the maximum value I can assign to it given my current resources. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any room for negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $800000 is significantly below my initial asking price, I understand you see value in the product.  To move towards a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1700000. I believe this price better reflects the true worth and potential of what's being offered.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1700000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This reflects my budget constraints and the value I currently place on this product. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thank you for your continued engagement. I see we are making progress. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $1450000 for the product. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it represents a fair and compelling offer.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate your continued flexibility. While I recognize the value you place on this product, $1450000 is still a bit higher than my limit.  I'm happy to offer $1200000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable solution if we continue to work together.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
