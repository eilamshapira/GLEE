"Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a lower price.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your budget concerns, I can't go as low as $5000. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $17500. Let me know if that works for you!",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $8000, which I believe is a fair offer considering the market value of similar products.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response! I understand the need to work within a budget. However, I can't go down to $8000. How about a final offer of $16000? I believe it reflects the value of the product while being more suitable for you. Let me know what you think!",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $16000 is still above my budget. Considering I have other options, such as buying from John for $10000, I'd like to propose a price of $9500. This is my highest offer, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your understanding and your proposal. While I can't go as low as $9500, I can offer you the product for $15000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and itâ€™s still a great deal considering the value. Let me know if you can work with that!",15000.0,Alice,7,
