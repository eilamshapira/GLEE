"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to consider the options carefully.

Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is $3,000 less than John's price of $15,000. Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and $12,000 is already below my maximum valuation of $15,000, this is a good offer.

I could reject and try to negotiate further, but there's a risk Alice might not accept a lower counteroffer, and we could end up at a higher price or I'd need to buy from John anyway.

Given that Alice's offer is already saving me $3,000 compared to John's price, accepting this offer is the rational choice.
