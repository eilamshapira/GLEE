Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have an excellent product available for you. I'm offering it at a price of $30,000. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 30000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $30000 is way beyond my budget. I can find similar products in the market for much less. I would be willing to pay $5000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
