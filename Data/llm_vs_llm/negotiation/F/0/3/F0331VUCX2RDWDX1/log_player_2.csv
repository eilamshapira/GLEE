"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to consider the best approach here. Alice's initial offer is $100, which is above the $80 threshold that the product is worth to me. I could simply buy from John right now for $80, but it might be worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer is $100 and I know I can get the product for $80 from John, I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably below $80 to give room for negotiation while still potentially saving money.

{""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has lowered her price to $90, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but it's still above John's price of $80. Since I know I can get the product for $80 from John, and Alice's current offer exceeds that price, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has come down from $100 to $90, which is a good sign. I'll move up slightly from my previous offer but still stay well below John's price to leave room for potential savings.
