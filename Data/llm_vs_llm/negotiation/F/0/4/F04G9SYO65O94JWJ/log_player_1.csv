Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price for the product to offer Bob. Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll need to balance between setting a price high enough to maximize my profit, while not being so high that Bob rejects it.

If Bob rejects my offer, I'm guaranteed to get $120 from John. So any price I offer to Bob should be at least $120 to make it worthwhile for me.

I'll set the price somewhat higher than my minimum acceptable value, but not excessively high to give Bob a reasonable chance of accepting:

{""product_price"": 180}"
