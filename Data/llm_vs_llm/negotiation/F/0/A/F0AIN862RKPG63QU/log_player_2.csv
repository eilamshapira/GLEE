"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since John's offer of $15,000 is lower than Alice's offer of $20,000, and the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, the rational decision is to buy from John. This saves me $5,000 compared to Alice's offer and matches my maximum valuation of the product."
