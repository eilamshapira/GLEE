"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since the product is worth $10,000 to me and Alice's initial offer is $11,000, which is above my desired price, I will reject the offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll offer a price that is substantially lower than my maximum budget of $10,000.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $8000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $9,500 is still above my desired price of $10,000, but it's getting closer. However, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. Since Alice was willing to come down from $11,000 to $9,500, I think she may be willing to come down further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous offer, but still lower than Alice's current offer. This will show that I'm willing to compromise and meet her halfway.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $9000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and settle on $9250?  I'm really motivated to make this deal work, and I'm confident this price is fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $9,250 is getting very close to my maximum budget of $10,000. At this point, I'm starting to think that it might not be worth continuing to negotiate, as the potential savings are relatively small. However, I'll make one more attempt to see if I can get an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous offer, but still lower than Alice's current offer. Since we're getting close to my maximum budget, I'll try to meet Alice halfway between my previous offer and her current offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to split the difference. I'm still interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,250. How about we settle on $9,125?"", ""product_price"": 9125}"
