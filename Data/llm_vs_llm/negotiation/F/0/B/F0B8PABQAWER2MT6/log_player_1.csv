Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is actually quite reasonable, providing a $200,000 premium over John's guaranteed offer. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John's lower offer. Given this, I'll accept Bob's offer.
