Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its potential value. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
