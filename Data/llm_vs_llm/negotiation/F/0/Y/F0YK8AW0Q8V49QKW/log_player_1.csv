"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since this is my first offer and I want to maximize my profit while leaving room for negotiation, I'll start with a high price.

{""product_price"": 2,500,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $400,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Since this is only round 2 and the gap between our prices is very large, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Given Bob's very low initial offer of $400,000, I'll reduce my price from the initial $2,500,000 but still maintain a strong position well above my minimum of $1,500,000.

{""product_price"": 2,100,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $500,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and his small increase from $400,000 to $500,000 suggests he might not be willing to reach a price that would be acceptable to me. Since I have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,500,000, and Bob seems to be very far from my target price, I'll choose to sell to John rather than continue negotiations that may not be productive.
