,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice! Thank you for the offer, but $180 is beyond my budget. I can offer $90 for the product, which I believe is fair considering my budget constraints. Let me know if we can work something out.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot go that low. The quality and value of this product justify a higher price. However, I can reduce my initial asking price. Would you consider purchasing it for $160? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for adjusting the price. However, $160 is still a bit out of my range. I can improve my offer to $100. I hope this can work for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
