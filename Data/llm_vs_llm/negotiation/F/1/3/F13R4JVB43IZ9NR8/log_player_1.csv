"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! Thank you for the offer, but $180 is beyond my budget. I can offer $90 for the product, which I believe is fair considering my budget constraints. Let me know if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $90 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and considering I have the guaranteed option to sell to John for $150, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer. While Bob's budget constraints are understandable, I need to ensure I don't sell below my minimum value.

Please let me make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot go that low. The quality and value of this product justify a higher price. However, I can reduce my initial asking price. Would you consider purchasing it for $160? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for adjusting the price. However, $160 is still a bit out of my range. I can improve my offer to $100. I hope this can work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $150. Bob's offers ($90 and $100) have been consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and his second offer only increased by $10, suggesting he's unlikely to reach a price that would be profitable for me. John's guaranteed offer of $150 is the better business decision, as it meets my minimum price requirement and ensures I don't lose value on the sale."
