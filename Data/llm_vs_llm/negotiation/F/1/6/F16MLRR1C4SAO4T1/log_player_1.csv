I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob reacts."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I need to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still leaving a healthy margin for myself. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. It's getting closer, but I believe I can still do better. I'll try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

This is my final counteroffer. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and Bob's previous offers. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll go with John's offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While I would like to make more than $800,000, it's a good deal considering the time spent negotiating. I'm happy to go with John's offer."
