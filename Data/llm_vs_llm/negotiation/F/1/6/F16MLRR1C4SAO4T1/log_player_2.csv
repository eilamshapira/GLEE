"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is above my maximum budget of $800,000, I will reject her offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm not sure what Alice's bottom line is, I'll start with a low offer and see how she responds.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $900,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000, but it's closer than her initial offer. I'm not willing to pay more than $800,000, so I'll reject her offer again and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above my budget, I'll try to meet her halfway between her last offer and my previous counteroffer. My previous counteroffer was $500,000, so I'll increase it to $700,000, which is still below my maximum budget of $800,000.

{""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $850,000 is very close to my maximum budget of $800,000, but it's still above it. At this point, I have to consider that I can buy the product from John for $800,000, which is a better deal for me. Since Alice's offer is only $50,000 more than John's offer, I'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate one last time to see if she can meet my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer is very close to my maximum budget, I'll make a counteroffer that is at my maximum budget of $800,000. This is my final offer, and if Alice rejects it, I'll likely buy the product from John.
