"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've highlighted, I need to consider my budget constraints.

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand budget considerations are important. However, this product delivers exceptional value with its $1500000 worth to your business operations. I can come down to $1200000, which still represents a significant $300000 in value creation for you. This is a competitive price for a product of this caliber, and I believe it represents a fair middle ground between your initial offer and my valuation.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and the effort to find common ground. I can see you're serious about acquiring this product. To move us closer to an agreement, I'm willing to reduce my price to $1150000. This represents a $350000 value opportunity for you while still reflecting the premium quality and features of the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that addresses both our interests. Let's make this deal work.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your latest offer is very close to my budget, but I need to make one final attempt to meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $1125000 for the product. This is my best and final offer, and I believe it fairly splits the difference between our last two proposals. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
