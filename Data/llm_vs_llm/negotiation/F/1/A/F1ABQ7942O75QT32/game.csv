"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $150 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $50 for the product.",50.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, $50 is far too low. I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? That's still a fair price for this incredible product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still above my budget. I can offer $60.",60.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $60 is still way below what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us and lets us close this deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
