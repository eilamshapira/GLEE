(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell it for $60. John is offering $100, so I should decline this lowball offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, Bob, I understand that $250 might be higher than you were expecting. However, this product has considerable value. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.
