"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","The price that Alice is offering is $1,800,000, which is significantly higher than the maximum $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me. It's also much higher than John's price of $1,000,000.

Since I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $1,800,000. However, before going to John, I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still gives her some profit considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to her.

{""product_price"": $600,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has lowered her price to $1,400,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this price is still higher than the $1,000,000 that John is offering and higher than the product's worth to me.

Since John's price of $1,000,000 is still better than Alice's current offer, I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I see that Alice is willing to negotiate down from her initial price. I'll increase my offer from the previous round but still aim for a price that's below John's $1,000,000 option.

{""product_price"": $800,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has lowered her price again to $1,200,000, which shows she's continuing to negotiate. However, this price is still higher than the $1,000,000 that John is offering and higher than the maximum I'm willing to pay.

Since John's price of $1,000,000 is still better than Alice's current offer, I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer. We still have several rounds left for negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I see Alice is continuing to lower her price, which is encouraging. I'll increase my offer a bit more to show good faith in our negotiation, while still aiming to get a better price than John's $1,000,000.

{""product_price"": $900,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has lowered her price to $1,100,000, which is closer to John's price but still $100,000 higher. Since John is offering the product for $1,000,000 and the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, I'll reject Alice's offer and make one more counteroffer.

We're getting closer, but I still have a better alternative with John if we can't reach an agreement below or at $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has been steadily lowering her price, and we're getting closer to a potential agreement. For my final counteroffer, I'll propose a price that's very close to John's price but still gives me a small advantage.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has lowered her price to $1,050,000, which is now just $50,000 more than John's offer of $1,000,000. However, since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and John is offering it at exactly that price, there's no reason for me to pay more than $1,000,000.

We've had several rounds of negotiation, and Alice hasn't been willing to match or beat John's price. At this point, I'll choose to buy from John instead.
