Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $250. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $250 is quite high for me. I can actually get this same product from another seller for $150. I'd be willing to buy from you instead for $120, which saves you the trouble of finding another buyer. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $150. Bob's offer of $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and since he mentioned he can get it elsewhere for $150, it's unlikely he'll accept a higher price from me. The guaranteed $150 from John is the best option."
