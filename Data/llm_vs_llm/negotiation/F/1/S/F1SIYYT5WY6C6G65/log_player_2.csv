"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $250. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $250, but I know that the product is worth no more than $150 to me. Also, I have the option to buy from John for $150 at any time.

Since Alice's price ($250) is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price, it makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $250 is quite high for me. I can actually get this same product from another seller for $150. I'd be willing to buy from you instead for $120, which saves you the trouble of finding another buyer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
