"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $1,150,000 is significantly higher than John's price of $1,000,000. Since I have the option to buy from John at $1,000,000 at any time, it would be wise to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so there might be room for negotiation to reach a price lower than $1,150,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1020000}

I'm making a counteroffer of $1,020,000, which is slightly above John's price of $1,000,000. This offer:

1. Gives Alice a chance to make more profit than if I went to John ($20,000 more)
2. Is still well below Alice's initial offer of $1,150,000
3. Is reasonable considering the product's value to Alice ($1,200,000)
4. Saves me money compared to Alice's initial offer while still being competitive

If Alice rejects this offer, I still have the option to go to John, which gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has only slightly lowered her price from $1,150,000 to $1,125,000, which is still $125,000 more than John's price. While Alice is showing some flexibility, this price is not competitive enough compared to John's offer of $1,000,000. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, as there's still room for negotiation and I have several rounds remaining. If we can't reach a more reasonable price, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1040000}

I'm increasing my previous offer by $20,000 to show willingness to negotiate and move closer to Alice's position. This offer of $1,040,000:

1. Is still significantly lower than Alice's last offer of $1,125,000
2. Provides Alice with $40,000 more profit than if I went to John
3. Shows good faith in the negotiation by moving up from my previous offer
4. Maintains a reasonable margin for me as it's still well below my maximum of $1,000,000
5. Leaves room for further negotiation if needed

By making this incremental increase, I'm demonstrating flexibility while still keeping the price competitive. If Alice rejects this offer, I still have several rounds of negotiation left and the option to go to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Here's why:

1. Alice's latest offer of $1,100,000 is still $100,000 more than John's price
2. While Alice has been lowering her price (from $1,150,000 to $1,125,000 to $1,100,000), the gap between her offers and John's price remains substantial
3. Given that my maximum value for the product is $1,000,000, John's price is already at my maximum acceptable price
4. The pattern of negotiations suggests Alice is unlikely to match or beat John's price
5. Continuing negotiations would only risk prolonging the process without significant benefit

Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 rather than continue negotiations with Alice or accept her higher price."
