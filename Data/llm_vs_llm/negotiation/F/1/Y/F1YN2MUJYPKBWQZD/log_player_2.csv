"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000), I will reject her offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000, I'll offer a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to see how she responds.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,400,000 is still higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000). However, it's a $100,000 reduction from her previous offer, which suggests that she's willing to negotiate.

I'll reject her offer again and make another counteroffer to see if I can get her to lower the price further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice reduced her price by $100,000 in the previous round, I'll try to meet her halfway between her new offer and my previous counteroffer. My previous counteroffer was $1,000,000, and Alice's new offer is $1,400,000, so I'll offer a price that's roughly in the middle of those two numbers, but still a bit lower to give myself some room for negotiation.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000), but she's getting closer. She's reduced her price by another $100,000, which suggests that she's willing to continue negotiating.

At this point, I'm starting to think that I might not be able to get her down to my target price, but I'll try one more time to see if I can get her to budge. If she rejects my next counteroffer, I might consider buying from John instead.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has reduced her price to $1,300,000, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's closer to my target price of $1,200,000. I'll offer a price that's slightly higher than my previous counteroffer of $1,100,000, but still lower than Alice's current offer.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,250,000 is very close to my target price of $1,200,000. In fact, it's only $50,000 higher. At this point, I'm starting to think that it might not be worth continuing to negotiate, since I can buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which is still lower than Alice's current offer.

Given that I have limited rounds left to negotiate, I think it's time to consider buying from John instead of continuing to try to get Alice to lower her price.
