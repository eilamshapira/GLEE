"Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and worth.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is beyond what I can spend. Considering my budget constraints and other options, I'm willing to offer you $7000 for the product.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $7000 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand budget constraints, I need to ensure a fair price that reflects the product's worth. I can reduce my initial asking price to $16000, which is a considerable reduction and represents good value for this product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering a reduction, Alice. However, $16000 is still quite steep for my current budget. I'd like to counter with $8000. I believe this is a fair offer that allows me to stay within my budget constraints.",8000.0,Bob,4,
