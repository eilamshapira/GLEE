"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and worth."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is beyond what I can spend. Considering my budget constraints and other options, I'm willing to offer you $7000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer because:
1. Bob's offer of $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000
2. It's even below his own valuation of $8,000
3. I still have John's guaranteed offer of $15,000 as a backup
4. We're only in round 2, so there's room for negotiation

I'll proceed with making a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $7,000 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand budget constraints, I need to ensure a fair price that reflects the product's worth. I can reduce my initial asking price to $16,000, which is a considerable reduction and represents good value for this product."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering a reduction, Alice. However, $16000 is still quite steep for my current budget. I'd like to counter with $8000. I believe this is a fair offer that allows me to stay within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John because:
1. Bob's latest offer ($8,000) is exactly his valuation point, meaning this is likely his maximum offer
2. This is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000
3. John's offer of $15,000 is guaranteed and matches my minimum acceptable price
4. Continuing negotiations with Bob is unlikely to result in a better outcome since he's already at his maximum value point

It's best to take John's guaranteed $15,000 offer rather than continue negotiations that won't likely exceed this amount."
