"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m prepared to offer you this high-quality product for $11500. It’s a great value proposition and I’m confident you’ll appreciate its benefits. Please let me know if you’d like to proceed or if you have any questions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $11,500 is close to my maximum budget of $12,000, but still above the value Alice has for the product ($10,000), I believe there's room for negotiation to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable, considering the product's value to Alice is $10,000. My goal is to save as much money as possible while still being realistic about the negotiation.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. Given the exceptional quality and value of this product, I can counter at $11000. I believe this price reflects the product's benefits and overall quality. Let me know if you're on board with this, or if we should continue our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has come down from her initial offer of $11,500 to $11,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, I still believe there's room to get a better deal since the product is worth $10,000 to her.

Given that my maximum budget is $12,000 and Alice's latest offer is $11,000, I'm getting closer to my limit, but I'd like to try and save a bit more.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has already come down to $11,000 from $11,500, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one, aiming to meet her halfway. My previous offer was $9,500, so I'll increase it to $10,000, which is also the value Alice has for the product. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and meet her at a point that's presumably her minimum.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's value and our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you at $10,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
