"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given the information, Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which exceeds the maximum value of $8,000 that the product is worth to me. Additionally, John is offering the same product for $8,000.

I should reject Alice's offer because it's too high, and I can potentially negotiate for a better price. If negotiations fail, I can always fall back on John's offer.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $13,000 is still above the $8,000 maximum value the product is worth to me, and it's also higher than John's offer of $8,000. Since Alice rejected my lower counteroffer and is still offering a price well above my maximum value, I should reject this offer and continue negotiating.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer of $12,500 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's offer ($8,000). Since we're now in round 5 and Alice has only reduced her price slightly from $13,000 to $12,500, it seems she might not be willing to go below her cost ($12,000) any time soon. 

Given that I can always buy from John at $8,000 and we're halfway through our 10 rounds, I'll reject Alice's offer and try one more counteroffer.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has now offered $12,000, which is exactly the product's worth to her, but it's still above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's offer ($8,000). 

We're now in round 7 of 10, and Alice seems to have reached her bottom line at $12,000 (the product's worth to her). Given that I can buy from John for $8,000, which is within my acceptable price range, and Alice is unlikely to go lower than her cost, it makes more sense to buy from John at this point.
