"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice's offer is $14,000, which is $1,000 less than John's fixed price of $15,000. While this is a savings, I know the product is only worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's significant room for negotiation. Since we have 10 rounds to negotiate, I should try to get a better price by making a counteroffer rather than accepting this first offer immediately.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still provides her with a good profit margin above her $8,000 cost.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her offer from $14,000 to $13,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, there's still significant room between her $13,000 offer and her $8,000 cost basis. Since we have plenty of rounds remaining (7 more after this), I should continue negotiating to try to reach a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer to show I'm negotiating in good faith, but still aim for a price that saves me significantly compared to both Alice's last offer and John's fixed price.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down to $12,000 from her initial $14,000 offer, showing meaningful movement in the negotiation. She's made a $1,000 concession in each round. We're making good progress, but I still have 5 more rounds after this one, so I can continue negotiating to try to reach a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll continue making progress in our negotiation by increasing my offer again. This shows I'm negotiating in good faith while still aiming for a price significantly better than John's alternative.
