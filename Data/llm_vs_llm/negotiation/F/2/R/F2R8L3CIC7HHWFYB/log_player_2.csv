"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum budget.**  Buying from her won't save you any money.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer doesn't change the price you'll pay from John.**  You'll still spend $1,200,000.

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice.  It doesn't cost you anything and keeps your options open."
