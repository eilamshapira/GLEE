"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm very interested in the product, I find $1400000 to be quite steep. Given the market conditions and similar products available, I would be willing to pay $950000. This would still provide you with a significant profit margin while being more aligned with market value. I look forward to your response.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the market value, but I still believe my product has a unique value that justifies a higher price. I'm willing to compromise, but not as low as $950000. I'd like to propose a middle ground.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your reduction in price. While I understand your product has unique value, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. I can increase my offer to $1100000, which represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and would still provide you with an excellent return. This price point better reflects both the product's value and current market conditions. Would you consider this as a fair compromise?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
