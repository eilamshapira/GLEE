Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm very interested in the product, I find $1400000 to be quite steep. Given the market conditions and similar products available, I would be willing to pay $950000. This would still provide you with a significant profit margin while being more aligned with market value. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $950,000 because I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the market value, but I still believe my product has a unique value that justifies a higher price. I'm willing to compromise, but not as low as $950,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your reduction in price. While I understand your product has unique value, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. I can increase my offer to $1100000, which represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and would still provide you with an excellent return. This price point better reflects both the product's value and current market conditions. Would you consider this as a fair compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I accept Bob's offer of $1,100,000. Although it's slightly lower than my initial target, it's still a very good price that recognizes the product's unique value and provides me with a significant profit. Given the back-and-forth negotiation, accepting this offer seems like the best choice to ensure a sale and avoid further potential reductions."
