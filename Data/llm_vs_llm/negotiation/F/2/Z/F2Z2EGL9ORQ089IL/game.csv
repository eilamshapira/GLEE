"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14500 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $9000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I understand your budget constraints, but the lowest I can go is $13000, which is still a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. Would you be able to meet me at this price?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming back with a lower price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9500. If this is still not acceptable, I'd be willing to consider meeting you in the middle, but I'd need you to come down a bit further.",9500.0,Bob,4,
