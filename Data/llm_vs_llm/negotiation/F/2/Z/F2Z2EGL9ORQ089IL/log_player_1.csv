Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $14,500. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14500 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $9,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Even if Bob doesn't accept my next offer, I know I can still sell to John for $12,000, so there's no reason to accept an offer below that amount."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $9,000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I understand your budget constraints, but the lowest I can go is $13,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. Would you be able to meet me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming back with a lower price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9500. If this is still not acceptable, I'd be willing to consider meeting you in the middle, but I'd need you to come down a bit further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $12,000. Bob's offers have been consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and his latest offer of $9,500 suggests he's not willing to go much higher. Since the product is worth no less than $12,000 to me, and John is offering exactly that amount, it makes the most sense to end the negotiation with Bob and take John's guaranteed offer."
