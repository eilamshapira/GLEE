"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product that I believe would be beneficial for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $14500. This is a competitive price for a product of this caliber.",14500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I believe the product is valuable, but the price of $14500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000, considering the product's market value and my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand budget considerations, but I must point out that $10000 is below what I can accept for this product. The product is actually worth $15000 in the market, and I have another buyer, John, who is already willing to pay $12000. However, I'd like to work with you, so I can reduce my price to $13500, which gives you a $1500 value compared to the market price. This is a fair offer considering the product's quality and value.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and the information about the market value. However, I still find $13500 to be higher than I'm comfortable paying. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11500. This price reflects a serious commitment to purchasing the product while also being mindful of my financial constraints.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, which shows we're both interested in making this deal work. However, I need to be transparent that $11500 is still below what I can accept, especially since I have a firm offer from John for $12000. Since we're making progress, I'm willing to come down to $13000. This is still a good value for a product worth $15000 to you, giving you $2000 in value. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position and the offer from John. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. Given that we're getting closer, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12200. This price is a significant increase from my previous offers and reflects my serious interest in the product. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value to me and the market conditions you've described.",12200.0,Bob,6,
