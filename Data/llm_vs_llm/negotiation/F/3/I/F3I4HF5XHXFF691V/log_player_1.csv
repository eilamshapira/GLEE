Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I believe the product is valuable, but the price of $14500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000, considering the product's market value and my budget.

Round 3

However, I'd like to work with you, so I can reduce my price to $13,500, which gives you a $1,500 value compared to the market price. This is a fair offer considering the product's quality and value."", ""product_price"": 13500}"

However, I need to be transparent that $11,500 is still below what I can accept, especially since I have a firm offer from John for $12,000. Since we're making progress, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a good value for a product worth $15,000 to you, giving you $2,000 in value.
