Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand budget considerations, but I must point out that $10000 is below what I can accept for this product. The product is actually worth $15000 in the market, and I have another buyer, John, who is already willing to pay $12000. However, I'd like to work with you, so I can reduce my price to $13500, which gives you a $1500 value compared to the market price. This is a fair offer considering the product's quality and value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

However, I still find $13,500 to be higher than I'm comfortable paying. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,500. This price reflects a serious commitment to purchasing the product while also being mindful of my financial constraints."", ""product_price"": 11500}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, which shows we're both interested in making this deal work. However, I need to be transparent that $11500 is still below what I can accept, especially since I have a firm offer from John for $12000. Since we're making progress, I'm willing to come down to $13000. This is still a good value for a product worth $15000 to you, giving you $2000 in value. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.
