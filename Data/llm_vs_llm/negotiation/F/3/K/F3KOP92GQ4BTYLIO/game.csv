"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. Given its exceptional quality and value, I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $150 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $100 to me, which happens to be the exact price that another seller, John, is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $80 for the product, which would give you a quick sale and me some savings compared to my alternative option.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must consider the product's value to me, which is significantly higher than $80. Given that you mentioned the product is worth $100 to you, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you the product for $120, which is still a competitive price considering its quality and value.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be practical about this purchase. As I mentioned, the product is worth $100 to me, and I can buy it from John for exactly that amount. For me to choose you over John, I would need a better price. I'm willing to offer $90, which would save me $10 compared to John's price while still providing you with a sale. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering the product's value to both of us, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you the product for $110, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, given its quality and value. This is still a better deal for you compared to buying from me at my initial price, and it allows me to meet my minimum requirements.",110.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate you lowering your price to $110, Alice. We're getting closer to an agreement. However, I want to be completely transparent - the product is worth exactly $100 to me, which is precisely what John is charging. At your current price of $110, I would be paying more than the product's value to me. I'm willing to offer $95, which is my final offer. This gives you a better deal than what the product is worth to you ($100), while still providing me with a small savings compared to buying from John. If we can't agree on this price, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.",95.0,Bob,6,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer and for being transparent about the product's value to you. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your final offer of $95 and the product's value to me, I'm willing to make one last compromise. I can offer you the product for $105, which is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept. If this price doesn't work for you, I understand that you have an alternative option with John, and I may need to consider other buyers as well.",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued negotiation, Alice. I appreciate that you've come down to $105, which is getting very close to a deal we can both accept. However, I still find myself in a difficult position since John is offering the exact same product at $100, which matches the product's value to me. I understand this is a business for you as well, so my final counteroffer is $97. This represents a compromise where we both benefit - you receive $97 for a product worth $100 to you (a small concession), and I pay $3 less than my alternative option. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to purchase from John, as paying more than $100 for this product doesn't make financial sense for me.",97.0,Bob,8,
