Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $150 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $100 to me, which happens to be the exact price that another seller, John, is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $80 for the product, which would give you a quick sale and me some savings compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, trying to find a middle ground that is closer to the product's value to me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must consider the product's value to me, which is significantly higher than $80. Given that you mentioned the product is worth $100 to you, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you the product for $120, which is still a competitive price considering its quality and value."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be practical about this purchase. As I mentioned, the product is worth $100 to me, and I can buy it from John for exactly that amount. For me to choose you over John, I would need a better price. I'm willing to offer $90, which would save me $10 compared to John's price while still providing you with a sale. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make another counteroffer to Bob in the next round, trying to get closer to the product's value to me while still being competitive with John's price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering the product's value to both of us, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you the product for $110, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, given its quality and value. This is still a better deal for you compared to buying from me at my initial price, and it allows me to meet my minimum requirements."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering your price to $110, Alice. We're getting closer to an agreement. However, I want to be completely transparent - the product is worth exactly $100 to me, which is precisely what John is charging. At your current price of $110, I would be paying more than the product's value to me. I'm willing to offer $95, which is my final offer. This gives you a better deal than what the product is worth to you ($100), while still providing me with a small savings compared to buying from John. If we can't agree on this price, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

However, considering Bob's message that $95 is his final offer, I will make a careful decision in the next round. If I don't think I can get a better price from Bob, I may consider selling to John for $100. 

For now, I will try to make one more counteroffer to Bob in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer and for being transparent about the product's value to you. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your final offer of $95 and the product's value to me, I'm willing to make one last compromise. I can offer you the product for $105, which is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept. If this price doesn't work for you, I understand that you have an alternative option with John, and I may need to consider other buyers as well."", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued negotiation, Alice. I appreciate that you've come down to $105, which is getting very close to a deal we can both accept. However, I still find myself in a difficult position since John is offering the exact same product at $100, which matches the product's value to me. I understand this is a business for you as well, so my final counteroffer is $97. This represents a compromise where we both benefit - you receive $97 for a product worth $100 to you (a small concession), and I pay $3 less than my alternative option. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to purchase from John, as paying more than $100 for this product doesn't make financial sense for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

At this point, I don't think I can get a better price from Bob, and he has made it clear that he has an alternative option with John at $100. Since the product is worth at least $100 to me, I will choose to sell it to John for $100, which is a better deal for me than Bob's offer of $97."
