"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer of $140 is close to Jhon's price of $150, and knowing that the product is worth $80 to Alice, I should reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $80 to Alice and $150 to me, I'll start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation. I'll offer a price closer to Alice's cost but still allowing for some profit.

{""product_price"": 100}

This offer gives Alice a $20 profit margin while still being significantly better for me than both Alice's initial offer ($140) and John's price ($150)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has reduced her price from $140 to $130, showing willingness to negotiate. However, since the product is worth $80 to her, there's still room for a better deal. The $130 price is still significantly higher than her cost, and we're far from the midpoint between her cost ($80) and my maximum value ($150). I'll reject this offer and try another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $10 from her initial offer, I'll increase my previous offer by $10 to show I'm also willing to negotiate and move towards a middle ground. This still leaves room for further negotiation while being fair to both parties.

{""product_price"": 110}

This offer would give Alice a $30 profit margin while still being significantly better than both her current offer ($130) and John's price ($150)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has come down to $120, which is a significant improvement from her initial $140 offer. She's showing consistent willingness to negotiate by reducing her price by $10 each time. At $120, this is a good deal compared to John's $150, and the negotiation pattern suggests we might be approaching the best price we can get. While there might be a small room for further negotiation, the risk of Alice becoming frustrated and stopping negotiations might not be worth the potential small savings. I'll accept this offer.
