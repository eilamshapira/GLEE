Hi Bob! I'm offering you a fantastic product that I believe you'll love. I'm selling it for $180. What do you think?,180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $180 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80. Would you be willing to consider it?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I appreciate your interest, but $80 is quite low for this product. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $150. What do you say?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $150 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about we meet at $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! Thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your position, $90 is still below my minimum threshold. How about we settle at $140? I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up a bit from my previous offer. How about we settle at $95? I think that's a reasonable price for the product.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still too low for me. How about I offer you the product for $135? I think it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",135.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $135 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about we settle at $98? I think that's a fair price for the product, considering our previous discussions.",98.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! Thanks for your patience throughout our negotiations. While I understand your position, $98 is still lower than I'd like. How about we settle at $130? I believe this is a reasonable compromise. Let me know if that works for you!",130.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price. However, $130 is still too high for me. Considering this is our final round, I'm willing to make one last offer. I'll meet you at $100, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",100.0,Bob,10,
