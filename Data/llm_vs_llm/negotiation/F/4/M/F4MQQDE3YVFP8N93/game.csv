"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product with immense value. I'm asking for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer, but $2000000 is way beyond what this product is worth to me. I'm looking to spend no more than $500000 for this product. I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me for $800000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but this product truly offers exceptional value. While $2000000 represents its full potential, I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice, but $1500000 is still well above what I can justify for this product. The maximum value this product has to me is $800000, which happens to be exactly what John is offering it for. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer $600000, which gives me some savings compared to John's price while still providing you with a fair deal.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1200000.  This offer represents a substantial compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the unique advantages this product provides.  It's significantly below my initial offer and reflects my desire to reach an agreement with you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on finding a price we can both agree on. However, $1200000 still exceeds what makes economic sense for me. I need to be clear - this product is worth no more than $800000 to my business, which is exactly what John is offering. To make it worth choosing you over him, I need a better price. I can go up to $650000, which would be my best offer. This gives you a solid sale while allowing me to realize some savings compared to my alternative option.",650000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm making a final offer to demonstrate my good faith and desire to close this deal.  I'll come down to $1000000, my absolute lowest price. This matches my alternative offer and reflects the true value of this product.  I believe this is a fair and reasonable price considering the long-term benefits you'll gain.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but I need to be completely transparent with you. The maximum value this product has to my business is $800000 - which is exactly what John is offering. There's simply no business justification for me to pay more than that amount. However, I do value building a relationship with you for future transactions. My final offer is $750000. This is very close to my alternative option, but it would allow us to close this deal and potentially work together again in the future. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $800000, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.",750000.0,Bob,8,
