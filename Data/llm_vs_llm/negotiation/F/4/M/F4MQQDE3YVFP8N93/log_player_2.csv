# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than the maximum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me. It's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $800,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer, but $2,000,000 is way beyond what this product is worth to me. I'm looking to spend no more than $500,000 for this product. I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me for $800,000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement."", ""product_price"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but this product truly offers exceptional value. While $2000000 represents its full potential, I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's revised offer of $1,500,000 is still significantly higher than both the maximum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me and John's guaranteed price of $800,000. There's still a large gap between our positions.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice, but $1,500,000 is still well above what I can justify for this product. The maximum value this product has to me is $800,000, which happens to be exactly what John is offering it for. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer $600,000, which gives me some savings compared to John's price while still providing you with a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1200000.  This offer represents a substantial compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the unique advantages this product provides.  It's significantly below my initial offer and reflects my desire to reach an agreement with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,200,000 is still well above the $800,000 maximum value to me and John's guaranteed price. While she's moving in the right direction, there's still a significant gap.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on finding a price we can both agree on. However, $1,200,000 still exceeds what makes economic sense for me. I need to be clear - this product is worth no more than $800,000 to my business, which is exactly what John is offering. To make it worth choosing you over him, I need a better price. I can go up to $650,000, which would be my best offer. This gives you a solid sale while allowing me to realize some savings compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 650000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm making a final offer to demonstrate my good faith and desire to close this deal.  I'll come down to $1000000, my absolute lowest price. This matches my alternative offer and reflects the true value of this product.  I believe this is a fair and reasonable price considering the long-term benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer of $1,000,000 still exceeds both the maximum value of the product to me ($800,000) and John's guaranteed price ($800,000). Since I can get the exact same product from John for $800,000, which is already at my maximum valuation, it doesn't make economic sense to pay more than that.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but I need to be completely transparent with you. The maximum value this product has to my business is $800,000 - which is exactly what John is offering. There's simply no business justification for me to pay more than that amount. However, I do value building a relationship with you for future transactions. My final offer is $750,000. This is very close to my alternative option, but it would allow us to close this deal and potentially work together again in the future. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $800,000, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
