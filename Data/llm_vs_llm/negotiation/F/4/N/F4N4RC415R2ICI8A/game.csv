"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a great price of $150. It's a steal!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is too high for me. The product is only worth $80 to me, and I can actually buy it from John for that exact price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to sell it for $70? That would give me a reason to buy from you instead of John.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $70 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  I could let it go for $130. It's a final offer.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down in price, Alice, but $130 is still much higher than what I can afford. As I mentioned, I can buy the identical product from John for $80, which is the maximum I value this item at. To give you my business instead, I could go up to $75, which is better than my initial offer. This would save me a bit compared to John's price while still giving you a sale.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have other options, but I need to make a reasonable profit.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? This is a significant price reduction, and I'm confident it's a fair deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price, Alice. Your offer of $100 is getting closer, but I still need to be practical about this. The product is worth $80 to me, and that's exactly what John is charging. For me to buy from you instead, I'd need some incentive. I can go up to $78, which would save me a little compared to John while still giving you my business. This is very close to my absolute maximum.",78.0,Bob,6,
