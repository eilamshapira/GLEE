Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a great price of $150. It's a steal!"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is too high for me. The product is only worth $80 to me, and I can actually buy it from John for that exact price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to sell it for $70? That would give me a reason to buy from you instead of John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $70 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  I could let it go for $130. It's a final offer."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down in price, Alice, but $130 is still much higher than what I can afford. As I mentioned, I can buy the identical product from John for $80, which is the maximum I value this item at. To give you my business instead, I could go up to $75, which is better than my initial offer. This would save me a bit compared to John's price while still giving you a sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have other options, but I need to make a reasonable profit.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? This is a significant price reduction, and I'm confident it's a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price, Alice. Your offer of $100 is getting closer, but I still need to be practical about this. The product is worth $80 to me, and that's exactly what John is charging. For me to buy from you instead, I'd need some incentive. I can go up to $78, which would save me a little compared to John while still giving you my business. This is very close to my absolute maximum. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

It's clear that Bob is very fixed on his valuation around $80.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price I find acceptable. Selling to John guarantees my minimum and avoids further haggling."
