"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a great price of $150. It's a steal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice is offering to sell the product to me for $150, which is much higher than my maximum value of $80. It's also higher than John's fixed price of $80.

Given that I can get the same product from John for $80, which is exactly my maximum value, there's no reason for me to accept Alice's offer of $150.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is too high for me. The product is only worth $80 to me, and I can actually buy it from John for that exact price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to sell it for $70? That would give me a reason to buy from you instead of John."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $70 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  I could let it go for $130. It's a final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has reduced her price from $150 to $130, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $130 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80).

Since I can get the exact same product from John for $80, and that price matches my maximum value, there's no reason for me to pay $130 to Alice.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down in price, Alice, but $130 is still much higher than what I can afford. As I mentioned, I can buy the identical product from John for $80, which is the maximum I value this item at. To give you my business instead, I could go up to $75, which is better than my initial offer. This would save me a bit compared to John's price while still giving you a sale."", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have other options, but I need to make a reasonable profit.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? This is a significant price reduction, and I'm confident it's a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has reduced her price again to $100, which shows she's continuing to negotiate. However, the offer of $100 is still above my maximum value of $80 and John's fixed price of $80.

Since I can get the exact same product from John for $80, which is exactly my maximum value for this product, there's no reason for me to pay $100 to Alice.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price, Alice. Your offer of $100 is getting closer, but I still need to be practical about this. The product is worth $80 to me, and that's exactly what John is charging. For me to buy from you instead, I'd need some incentive. I can go up to $78, which would save me a little compared to John while still giving you my business. This is very close to my absolute maximum."", ""product_price"": 78}"
