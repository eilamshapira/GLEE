"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $11000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $11000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value, and I know it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I can reduce my initial asking price to $13800, which I believe is a fair compromise.",13800.0,Alice,3,
