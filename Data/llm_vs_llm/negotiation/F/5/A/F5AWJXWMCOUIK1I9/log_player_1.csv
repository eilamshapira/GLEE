"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $14,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 (and even below John's guaranteed offer), I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. We still have several rounds to negotiate, and since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, there should be room for a mutually beneficial agreement at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $11,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value, and I know it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I can reduce my initial asking price to $13,800, which I believe is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 13800}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the response.  I understand the product has value, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps around $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $12,500. This is a reasonable price that's above my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and better than John's guaranteed offer. While it's less than my initial asking price, it represents a fair compromise and ensures a profitable transaction for both parties. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether, and the current offer provides a satisfactory outcome."
