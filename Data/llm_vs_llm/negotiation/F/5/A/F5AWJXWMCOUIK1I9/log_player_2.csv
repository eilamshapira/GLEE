Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $11000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value, and I know it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I can reduce my initial asking price to $13800, which I believe is a fair compromise.
