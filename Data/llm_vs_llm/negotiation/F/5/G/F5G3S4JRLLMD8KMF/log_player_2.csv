(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your maximum price and even higher than her own valuation. It makes sense to negotiate or go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
``` 

This is a starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer and gives us room to negotiate upward while staying well below our $800,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,575,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice barely budged from her initial outrageous offer. It's clear she's not taking our negotiation seriously yet. We continue."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

We'll increase our offer slightly to show willingness to move, but we're still keeping it well below our upper limit and John's price. It's a waiting game now to see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but at a snail's pace.  We're still nowhere near a reasonable price. We need to signal we're willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 725000}
```

We're raising our offer again, but this is our final offer.  If Alice doesn't significantly decrease her price in the next round, we're going with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still way too high. It's clear she's not going to come down to a reasonable price.  We're better off cutting our losses and going with John's guaranteed offer."
