"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's quite steep. I'm looking to spend no more than $1000000. How about we start at $600000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $600000 is below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $4000000, considering your budget constraints. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that my last offer might still be a stretch for you. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $3000000? This price reflects a substantial reduction from my initial offer while still acknowledging the high value of the product. What are your thoughts?",3000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I'm keen to work with you, $800000 is still below what I can accept. Let's try to find a more suitable figure. How about $2500000? This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and should reflect a fair compromise. What do you say?",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're still a bit apart on the price. Let's try to close the gap further. I'm willing to lower the price to $2000000. This is a substantial discount and I believe it's a fair price for the value the product brings. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,5,
