"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but the lowest I can go on this product is $13000. It's a fantastic deal at this price, and I believe it's worth considering. Let me know your thoughts!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $13000 is still above what I'm looking to spend. How about we settle at $9500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you can work with that!",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to maintain a minimum price to make this deal work. How about we meet in the middle at $12500? This is the best I can do while still providing you with a high-quality product. Let me know if this works for you!",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for trying to meet in the middle, but $12500 is still a bit high for me. I can go up to $10000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. If this works for you, let's finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
