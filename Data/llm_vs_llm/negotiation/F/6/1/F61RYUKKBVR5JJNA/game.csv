"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations if you have a different valuation in mind.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $12000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $6000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $6000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to sell for. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer the product to you for $10000, which is lower than my initial offer but still reflects the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $10000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $7000. I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer the product to you for $8500. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. Let me know your thoughts.",8500.0,Alice,5,
