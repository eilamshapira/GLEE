"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $15,000, which is $3,000 more than my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $12,000

The logical choice is to buy from John since:
- It saves me $3,000 compared to Alice's offer
- It matches my maximum valuation of the product
- There's no reason to pay more than necessary for the same product
