"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price, considering I can get it from another seller for the same price you're offering. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must consider the product's value and the potential offers I may receive from other buyers. Given this, I'm willing to make a compromise and lower the price to $1050000, which I believe is still a fair value for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the compromise, but I still believe we can find a better price for both of us.
