"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer is at the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and selling to John would result in the same amount, I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price from Bob.

My counteroffer will be slightly lower than my initial offer, to show that I'm willing to compromise.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's new offer of $1,350,000 is higher than my minimum acceptable price and also higher than what I can get from John. Since Bob is willing to pay more than my minimum, and his offer is closer to the value he has for the product ($1,500,000), I'll consider accepting this offer.
