Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is higher than the minimum value of $8,000 that I have for the product, and it shows that he is interested in the product, I will not sell to John yet. However, I believe the product is worth more than $9,000, so I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try and get a better price.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you have a certain budget in mind, but I still believe the product is worth more than $9,000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your interest, I'm willing to slightly reduce my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still very interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Considering your reduced offer, I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's new offer of $10,000 is getting closer to what I believe the product is worth, and it shows that he is still very interested in purchasing it. Since $10,000 is a significant increase from his initial offer and is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, I will accept this offer as it seems like a reasonable compromise.
