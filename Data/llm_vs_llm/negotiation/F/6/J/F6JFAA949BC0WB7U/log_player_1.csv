Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Considering Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me, and I know I can sell it to John for $120, I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.
