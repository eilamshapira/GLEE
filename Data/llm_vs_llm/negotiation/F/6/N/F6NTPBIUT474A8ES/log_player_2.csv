You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The offer from Alice is $9,000, which is higher than the $8,000 the product is worth to me and also higher than John's price of $8,000. Since Alice's offer exceeds my maximum value and is more expensive than my alternative option, I should reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and John is offering it for $8,000, I should try to negotiate a better price with Alice. The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so she shouldn't accept anything below that. However, I'll make a counteroffer below $8,000 to leave room for negotiation.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has lowered her price to $8,500, but this is still higher than John's offer of $8,000. Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me and I can buy it from John for exactly $8,000, I should reject Alice's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice rejected my previous offer of $7,200 and countered with $8,500, I'll increase my offer but still try to get a better deal than John's $8,000 price.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has lowered her price to $8,200, which is still above John's offer of $8,000. Since I can get the same product from John for $8,000, which is already at my maximum value threshold, I should reject Alice's offer.
