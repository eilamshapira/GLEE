"Thank you for your offer, Alice, but I was hoping to spend less on this product. How about I pay $8000 for it? Would you consider this counteroffer? I'm looking forward to your response.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is too low for this product. My minimum acceptable price is $12000, which is actually the same amount another buyer, John, is willing to pay right now. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Would you be able to meet me at $12000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
