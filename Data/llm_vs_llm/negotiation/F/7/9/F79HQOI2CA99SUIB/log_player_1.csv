"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Let me start with a high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Since I have a guaranteed option to sell to John for $1,200,000, and Bob's opening offer is so low (less than half of my initial asking price), I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial price but still maintain a strong position, considering Bob's low initial offer and my guaranteed alternative with John.

{""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob has only increased his offer by $100,000, still keeping it well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. His small increment suggests he might not be willing to reach my minimum price point. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $1,200,000, and we're already in round 4 with Bob showing little movement toward an acceptable price, I'll choose to sell to John.
