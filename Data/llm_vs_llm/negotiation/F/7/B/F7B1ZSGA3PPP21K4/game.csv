"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let's start the negotiation.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I am looking for a much lower price. How about we start at $50?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $50 is quite far from what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a fair price for the product. Let's meet in the middle.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still can't agree to that price. How about we try $60?",60.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $60 is still a long way from what I'm comfortable with. I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to feel like I'm getting a fair deal. Let's try to find a compromise. I can offer you the product for $165, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.",165.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. However, $165 is still above my budget. How about we settle at $70?",70.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think that we might not be able to come to an agreement. $70 is not a serious offer for this product, and I'm beginning to question whether you're truly interested in purchasing it. I'll make one more concession, but it's not going to be a large one. I can sell the product to you for $160, which is an excellent price considering its value. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",160.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your concessions. However, $160 is still too high for my budget. How about we try $75 as a final offer?",75.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but $75 is still far too low for this product. I've made significant concessions already, and I'm not willing to go any lower. As a last attempt to reach an agreement, I'll offer the product to you for $155. This is an extremely fair price, and I'm only offering it to you because I've invested time and effort into our negotiation. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to end our negotiation and explore other options.",155.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your patience, Alice. I appreciate the effort you've put into this negotiation. However, $155 is still out of my budget. As a final offer, I can go up to $80. I hope we can close this deal.",80.0,Bob,10,
