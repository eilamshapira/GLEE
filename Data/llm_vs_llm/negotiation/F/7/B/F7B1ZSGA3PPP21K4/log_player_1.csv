"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I am looking for a much lower price. How about we start at $50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $50 is too low for me. I'm aiming to get a better price, and selling to John for $150 is still an option if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $50 is quite far from what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a fair price for the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 175}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still can't agree to that price. How about we try $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

$60 is still too low for me, and I believe the product is worth more. I'll make another counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us. Selling to John for $150 is becoming a more attractive option, but I'll give the negotiation with Bob a few more rounds to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $60 is still a long way from what I'm comfortable with. I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to feel like I'm getting a fair deal. Let's try to find a compromise. I can offer you the product for $165, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 165}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. However, $165 is still above my budget. How about we settle at $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

$70 is still far too low for me, and I'm starting to think that Bob's budget is not aligned with the product's value. However, I'll give him one more chance to meet me at a reasonable price. I'll make another counteroffer, but if it's not accepted, I'll likely sell to John for $150, as it's becoming clear that Bob is not willing to pay a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to think that we might not be able to come to an agreement. $70 is not a serious offer for this product, and I'm beginning to question whether you're truly interested in purchasing it. I'll make one more concession, but it's not going to be a large one. I can sell the product to you for $160, which is an excellent price considering its value. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your concessions. However, $160 is still too high for my budget. How about we try $75 as a final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

$75 is still an unacceptably low price for the product, and I'm not willing to sell it for that amount. Bob's ""final offer"" suggests that he's not willing to budge further, and I don't see any point in continuing to negotiate if he's not willing to meet me at a reasonable price. I'll make one last counteroffer, but if it's not accepted, I'll sell to John for $150, which is a much better option than selling to Bob for $75."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but $75 is still far too low for this product. I've made significant concessions already, and I'm not willing to go any lower. As a last attempt to reach an agreement, I'll offer the product to you for $155. This is an extremely fair price, and I'm only offering it to you because I've invested time and effort into our negotiation. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to end our negotiation and explore other options."", ""product_price"": 155}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your patience, Alice. I appreciate the effort you've put into this negotiation. However, $155 is still out of my budget. As a final offer, I can go up to $80. I hope we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

$80 is an insultingly low price for the product, and I'm not willing to sell it for that amount. I've given Bob every opportunity to meet me at a reasonable price, and he's consistently shown that he's not willing to pay a fair value for the product. At this point, selling to John for $150 is the clear best option. I'll end the negotiation with Bob and sell the product to John, ensuring that I get a price that reflects the product's true value."
