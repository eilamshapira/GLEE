"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob and $15,000 to me, I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum value.

{""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is well below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, and even below what the product is worth to him ($10,000), I'll reject this offer. However, since I have the guaranteed option to sell to John for $15,000, there's no reason to accept anything below that amount. If negotiations with Bob don't improve significantly, I can always take John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer, but still keep it above my minimum value of $15,000, since I can always sell to John at that price.

{""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $9,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, and even below what the product is worth to him ($10,000). Since we've gone through several rounds and Bob's offers are still far below my minimum acceptable value, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $15,000, it makes the most sense to end the negotiation with Bob and sell to John.
