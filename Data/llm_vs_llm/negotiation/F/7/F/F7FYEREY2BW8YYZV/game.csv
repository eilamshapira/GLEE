"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than $10000. Considering our previous negotiations, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $14000, which I believe is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth. If this price doesn't meet your expectations, I may need to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,5,

I can offer $11500 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering both our interests.
