"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","**{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**

Let's see if Alice is willing to lower her price. There's no harm in trying to negotiate, as I can always buy from John for $150 if Alice's best offer is not better.

**Counteroffer: $100**

Let's start the negotiation low, but reasonable, to see how Alice responds."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you think the price is a bit high, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least a bit more than your offer. How about we meet in the middle?

Alice has lowered her price, but let's see if we can get an even better deal.
