"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. I believe it will be a valuable addition for you. I'm offering it for $155. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:
1. Alice is offering the product for $155
2. The product is only worth $120 to me
3. John is willing to sell it for $120
4. Alice's offer ($155) is higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120)

Since Alice's offer is higher than my maximum value and higher than John's alternative price, it wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. I could try to negotiate with Alice by rejecting and making a counteroffer, but since John is offering exactly my maximum value, it's more efficient to just buy from John.
