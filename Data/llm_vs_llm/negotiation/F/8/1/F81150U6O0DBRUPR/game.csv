"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I believe the product's value to me is around $1000000. I'd like to counter with an offer of $900000, considering potential negotiations. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to keep the cost within my budget. How about we settle at $950000?
