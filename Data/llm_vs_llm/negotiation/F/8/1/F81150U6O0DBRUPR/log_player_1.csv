Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I believe the product's value to me is around $1000000. I'd like to counter with an offer of $900000, considering potential negotiations. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

# The product's value to you is no less then $1,000,000. You won't accept an offer that low.
# Selling to John is your backup plan, and you are confident you can negotiate a higher price with Bob.
# You will try to find a middle ground in the next round to maximize your profit."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to keep the cost within my budget. How about we settle at $950000? This is a step up from my last offer and closer to your current one. I believe this could work well for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

# Although Bob's offer is below your initial goal, it's close enough and he has shown willingness to increase his price.
# Accepting this offer seems to be the best choice, as continuing negotiations might lead to a breakdown or a lower price.
# Selling to John for $1,000,000 might be more profitable, but it's also possible that Bob will accept a higher price in the next round. However, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a good profit."
