"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob and I want to earn as much money as I can, I'll start by offering a high price. I know I have a safety net of $1,200,000 from John, so I can be aggressive in my negotiation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is higher than my minimum price of $1,200,000 and lower than the value of the product to him ($1,500,000), I still have room to negotiate for a better price.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer, trying to get closer to the $1,500,000 that the product is worth to him.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob offered $1,300,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than his offer but still leaves room for further negotiation. I'll aim for a midpoint between Bob's offer and the product's value to him.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's new offer of $1,350,000 is getting closer to the product's value to him, but it's still $150,000 short of the $1,500,000. Considering I have a safety net of $1,200,000 from John, I can continue to negotiate.

However, since Bob's offer is now higher than my previous counteroffer of $1,450,000, and we are only in round 4 out of 10, I'll reject his offer again and try to get an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's last offer was $1,350,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one, trying to meet him halfway. I'll aim for a price that's closer to the $1,500,000 that the product is worth to him, but still leaves some room for further negotiation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's new offer of $1,375,000 is getting closer to the product's value to him, and it's a significant increase from his previous offers. Considering we are halfway through the negotiation rounds, I'll assess the situation.

While $1,375,000 is still short of the $1,500,000 that the product is worth to Bob, it's a good price, and I have to consider the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob. If I reject this offer and Bob decides to walk away, I'll be left with the $1,200,000 offer from John, which is $175,000 less than Bob's current offer.

Given the progress we've made and the potential risks, I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,375,000.
