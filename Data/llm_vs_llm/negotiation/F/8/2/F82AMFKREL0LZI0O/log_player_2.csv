"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000, which is at the upper limit of what the product is worth to me. Since Alice values the product at $1,200,000, there's room for negotiation where both of us can benefit. Buying from John would also cost $1,500,000, so there's no advantage in doing that right now.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still gives her a decent profit over her valuation of $1,200,000.

{""product_price"": $1,300,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has come down $50,000 from her initial offer, which is progress. However, since the product is worth $1,200,000 to her, there's still room for negotiation to get a better price. $1,450,000 is still quite high compared to what I'd like to pay.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still aim for a price that gives me good value while providing Alice with a reasonable profit above her $1,200,000 valuation.

{""product_price"": $1,350,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her price again to $1,425,000, which is $25,000 less than her previous offer. We're making progress, but I think we can still get a better price. The product is worth $1,200,000 to her, so she's still looking at a $225,000 profit. I want to try negotiating further to get a more balanced deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I see we're making steady progress. Alice reduced her offer by $25,000 this time. I'll increase my offer by a similar amount to show good faith and keep the negotiation moving forward.
