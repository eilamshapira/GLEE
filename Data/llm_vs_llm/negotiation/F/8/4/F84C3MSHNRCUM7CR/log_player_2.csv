"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price Alice is offering ($2,000,000) is twice the amount that the product is worth to me ($1,000,000) and also twice what John is offering. It would be unwise to accept this offer when I have a guaranteed option to buy it for $1,000,000 from John. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

I'll offer $800,000, which is 20% below John's price. This gives Alice room to negotiate while still being significantly better than her initial $2,000,000 offer. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, she might consider this offer as she would still make a profit of $200,000. If she rejects this, we can continue negotiating, and I still have the fallback option of buying from John at $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,800,000 is still significantly higher than John's price of $1,000,000. While she has reduced her initial price by $200,000, it's still not competitive with my alternative option. There's no reason to accept a price that's $800,000 higher than what I can get elsewhere. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, trying to reach a more reasonable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 850000}

I'll slightly increase my previous offer to $850,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and move upward, but still maintains a good price point that would be beneficial for both parties. This price would give Alice a $150,000 profit since the product is worth $1,000,000 to her, while saving me $150,000 compared to buying from John. If she rejects this, I still have several rounds to negotiate or can fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still significantly higher than John's price of $1,000,000. While she continues to lower her price, it's still $600,000 more than my alternative option. Even though she's showing willingness to negotiate by reducing her price, there's no reason to accept an offer that's so much higher than John's price. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, continuing to work towards a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 900000}

I'll increase my offer to $900,000. This represents another step up from my previous offer of $850,000, showing continued good faith in negotiations. At this price, Alice would still make a $100,000 profit (since the product is worth $1,000,000 to her), and I would save $100,000 compared to buying from John. This offer creates a win-win situation where both parties benefit. If Alice rejects this, I still have the option to buy from John at $1,000,000, but I'm hoping this more attractive offer will lead to an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still $200,000 higher than John's price. While she has made significant movement from her initial offer of $2,000,000 down to $1,200,000, it still doesn't make financial sense to accept when I have a guaranteed option at $1,000,000. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, but if we can't get closer to John's price soon, I may need to take John's offer as we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 950000}

I'll increase my offer to $950,000. This is my highest offer yet, just $50,000 below John's price. At this price point, Alice would still make a $50,000 profit since the product is worth $1,000,000 to her, and I would save $50,000 compared to buying from John. We're getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds, so this offer demonstrates my serious intent to close the deal while still maintaining some savings compared to my alternative option. If Alice rejects this, I may need to consider taking John's offer as we only have a few rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still $50,000 higher than John's guaranteed price of $1,000,000. While we've made significant progress in negotiations from the initial $2,000,000 offer, there's no reason to pay more than what John is offering. We're also in the second-to-last round, and given the pattern of negotiations, it's unlikely we'll reach a price below $1,000,000 in the final round. Therefore, the most rational decision is to take John's offer at $1,000,000 and save the $50,000 rather than continue negotiations or accept Alice's higher price."
