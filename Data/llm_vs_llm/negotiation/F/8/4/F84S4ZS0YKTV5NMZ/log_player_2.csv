(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's a chance we can get a better price. We have plenty of rounds to negotiate and the potential savings outweigh the risk of losing this deal. We'll counteroffer lower and see how Alice responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:** We're starting with a strong counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's opening price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still potentially staying well below our $1,500,000 limit."

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is coming down, but slowly.  Her counteroffer suggests there's still room for negotiation. We'll continue to play it cool and counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
