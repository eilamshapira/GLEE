"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and Alice's initial offer is $15,000, which is significantly higher than my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. I will proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of negotiating a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and within my budget. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a lower offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $14,000 is still higher than my budget of $8,000. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $8,000, I don't see a reason to accept Alice's offer or make another counteroffer that is still far from my target price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, but I'm leaning towards buying from John if the price doesn't come down significantly)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer is still quite high, I'll make another counteroffer that is closer to my target price. I'll try to meet Alice halfway between my previous offer and her new offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $13,000 is still significantly higher than my budget of $8,000. At this point, I don't think it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as the price is not coming down quickly enough.

Given that I can buy the product from John for $8,000, which is within my budget, I think it's time to stop negotiating with Alice and explore the alternative option.
