"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to let it go for a price of $11000. I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $11,000, which is above the $8,000 limit of what the product is worth to me. John is offering the same product for $8,000, which is exactly at my maximum value threshold.

There's no reason for me to accept Alice's current offer since it exceeds my maximum value, and I have a guaranteed alternative at my maximum acceptable price.

I could try to negotiate with Alice to get a better price than John's $8,000, but since John's price is already at my maximum valuation, the most rational decision is to simply buy from John.
