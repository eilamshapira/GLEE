"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, and I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price point that is more aligned with my budget. I'm willing to offer $600000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate and try to reach a better price. Selling to John is an option, but I want to explore the possibility of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob first. 

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make some concessions, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price point."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I need to manage my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $700000? This way, both parties can walk away feeling good about the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer of $700,000 is an improvement from his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than the product's worth to me. Meeting in the middle doesn't necessarily mean meeting at the midpoint of our offers, especially since Bob's initial offer was quite low. I'm willing to continue negotiating to try to reach a better price.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable meeting at $700,000. I'm willing to make some concessions, but I think a more reasonable price point would be $1,050,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see that we're still a bit apart on the price, Alice. Let's try to bridge this gap further. How about $750000? I believe this is a fair consideration for both our standpoints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer of $750,000 is a slight improvement from his previous offer, it's still far from the product's worth to me. I've already made concessions by lowering my price from $1,150,000 to $1,050,000, and I'm not willing to go much lower. I'll continue to negotiate to try to reach a better price.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price point you're offering. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet at $1,000,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
