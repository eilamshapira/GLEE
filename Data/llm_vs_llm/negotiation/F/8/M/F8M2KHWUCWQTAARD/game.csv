"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm offering to you first before considering other buyers. Based on its features and market value, I'm pricing it at $24000. This is a premium product that provides excellent value, and I believe this is a fair price. Are you interested?",24000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming to me first. While I believe the product is good, $24000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm more comfortable in the $8000 range. Would that be workable for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. I understand budget considerations, but I need to be transparent that $8000 is significantly below the product's value. My absolute minimum is $15000, which is what I've been offered by another buyer. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $20500, which I believe represents a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. Would this work for you?",20500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I understand the other offer you have, my budget is firm. To be honest, anything above $10000 is pushing it for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your budget constraints. I've come down significantly from my initial offer, and while I value doing business with you, I need to be practical about the product's worth. I have a guaranteed offer of $15000 from another buyer, but I'd still prefer to work with you. My best offer is $17000, which is still considerably below my initial price. This represents a good value for the quality you're getting, while allowing me to make a reasonable return. Can we agree on this price?",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for explaining your position. It seems we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12000, but that's absolutely as high as I can go.  It's a competitive offer considering my budget limitations.  What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort to reach a middle ground, and I understand you have budget constraints. However, I need to be straightforward - I have a guaranteed offer of $15000 from John, and I simply cannot accept less than that amount. If we're going to do business together, I need at least $15500 for the product. This is my final offer and represents a substantial discount from my initial price while still being fair to both of us. Can we close the deal at this price?",15500.0,Alice,7,
