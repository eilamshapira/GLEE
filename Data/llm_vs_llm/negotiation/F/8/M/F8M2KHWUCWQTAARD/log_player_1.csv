Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm offering to you first before considering other buyers.

Are you interested?"", ""product_price"": 24000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming to me first. While I believe the product is good, $24000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm more comfortable in the $8000 range. Would that be workable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. I understand budget considerations, but I need to be transparent that $8,000 is significantly below the product's value. My absolute minimum is $15,000, which is what I've been offered by another buyer. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $20,500, which I believe represents a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 20500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I understand the other offer you have, my budget is firm. To be honest, anything above $10000 is pushing it for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your budget constraints. I've come down significantly from my initial offer, and while I value doing business with you, I need to be practical about the product's worth. I have a guaranteed offer of $15,000 from another buyer, but I'd still prefer to work with you. My best offer is $17,000, which is still considerably below my initial price. This represents a good value for the quality you're getting, while allowing me to make a reasonable return. Can we agree on this price?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to reach a middle ground, and I understand you have budget constraints. However, I need to be straightforward - I have a guaranteed offer of $15,000 from John, and I simply cannot accept less than that amount. If we're going to do business together, I need at least $15,500 for the product. This is my final offer and represents a substantial discount from my initial price while still being fair to both of us. Can we close the deal at this price?"", ""product_price"": 15500}"
