"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm offering to you first before considering other buyers. Based on its features and market value, I'm pricing it at $24000. This is a premium product that provides excellent value, and I believe this is a fair price. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $24,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $24,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming to me first. While I believe the product is good, $24,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm more comfortable in the $8,000 range. Would that be workable for you?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. I understand budget considerations, but I need to be transparent that $8000 is significantly below the product's value. My absolute minimum is $15000, which is what I've been offered by another buyer. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $20500, which I believe represents a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. Would this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I understand the other offer you have, my budget is firm. To be honest, anything above $10,000 is pushing it for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your budget constraints. I've come down significantly from my initial offer, and while I value doing business with you, I need to be practical about the product's worth. I have a guaranteed offer of $15000 from another buyer, but I'd still prefer to work with you. My best offer is $17000, which is still considerably below my initial price. This represents a good value for the quality you're getting, while allowing me to make a reasonable return. Can we agree on this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for explaining your position. It seems we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,000, but that's absolutely as high as I can go.  It's a competitive offer considering my budget limitations.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your effort to reach a middle ground, and I understand you have budget constraints. However, I need to be straightforward - I have a guaranteed offer of $15000 from John, and I simply cannot accept less than that amount. If we're going to do business together, I need at least $15500 for the product. This is my final offer and represents a substantial discount from my initial price while still being fair to both of us. Can we close the deal at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Reason: Alice has revealed that her bottom line is $15,000 and she already has an offer for that amount.  It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and I'm unwilling to pay more than my $12,000 limit. John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000, which is the best option at this point."
