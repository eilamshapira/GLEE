"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $16000. This price is still lower than my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make a compromise and offer the product to you for $14000. If this is still not within your budget, I'm open to further negotiations. But I want to emphasize that I have other interested buyers, and I need to consider their offers as well.",14000.0,Alice,5,
