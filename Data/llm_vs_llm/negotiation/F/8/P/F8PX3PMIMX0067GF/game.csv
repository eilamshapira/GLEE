"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer of $10000, but I can't go that low considering the product's quality and market value. I can come down to $11500, which is already a significant discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of what you'll be getting. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $11000. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,4,
