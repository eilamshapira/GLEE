Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what price to offer Bob that maximizes my earnings while still being attractive enough for him to accept.

The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so that's his maximum willingness to pay.
The product is worth at least $800,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed fallback option with John at exactly $800,000.

If I price too high, Bob might reject the offer, and I'll end up with $800,000 from John.
If I price too low, I'll leave money on the table.

Since Bob knows I have the John option, I can be somewhat aggressive in my pricing. I could offer the product at $1,200,000, which gives Bob a $300,000 surplus while giving me a significant premium over my fallback option.
