"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that Alice's offer is $20,000, which is significantly higher than both your maximum valuation ($8,000) and John's alternative offer ($8,000), it doesn't make economic sense to accept Alice's offer.

Since John is offering the product at exactly your maximum valuation ($8,000), and Alice's initial offer is so high, it's most rational to simply buy from John rather than engage in a potentially lengthy negotiation with Alice.
