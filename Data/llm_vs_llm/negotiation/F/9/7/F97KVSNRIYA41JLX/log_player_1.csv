"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its worth to me."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is lower than the product's worth to me ($15,000) and also lower than what I can get from John ($15,000), I will reject Bob's offer. However, I still see potential in negotiating with Bob, so I won't sell to John just yet.

My decision is to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me but still enticing enough for Bob to consider.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $12,000. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product's value is higher than your offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Considering your interest and the product's worth, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. This price reflects a compromise from my initial offer while still acknowledging the product's value."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer of $18000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still find it a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering my budget and the product's value to me, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000. This price is closer to my limit, and I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's counteroffer of $14,000 is getting closer to what I consider acceptable, but it's still slightly below the product's worth to me and what John is willing to pay ($15,000). Since Bob is moving closer to my target price and I want to maximize my earnings, I'll reject his offer again and try to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $14,000. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. Considering your latest offer and the fact that we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16,000. This price is a slight reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer of $16000. I appreciate the reduction, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. Since I know I can get the product from John for $15000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14500. This price is slightly higher than my previous offer, showing my willingness to compromise, but still reflects the market value I'm aware of. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's counteroffer of $14,500 is very close to what John is willing to pay ($15,000), and it's higher than his previous offer, showing that he's willing to compromise. Given that I want to maximize my earnings and Bob's offer is now very competitive with John's offer, I'll consider accepting it. However, since Bob mentioned the market value and his knowledge of John's offer, I might try to squeeze out a bit more if possible.

But considering the negotiation has been going on for a while and Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I think it's a good time to make a decision that ensures I sell the product without risking losing both deals.

This price is slightly higher than your offer, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value considering our negotiation.
