"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $110, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the quality, $110 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $90. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll reduce the price to $100. This is a more reasonable compromise, considering the product's quality and worth.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. $100 is still higher than I'd like. How about $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. You've moved up from $90 to $95, which shows you're interested in the product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to feel that we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial price. I'll meet you at $98, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! $98 is almost there, but I'm trying to stick to my budget. Would you consider $96?",96.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to an agreement. I appreciate your budget constraints, but I also need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Since you've come up to $96, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'll sell the product to you for $97. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value and our negotiations so far. I hope this price works for you.",97.0,Alice,7,
