"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $110, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the quality, $110 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $90 is still below my target, and I believe the product is worth more to Bob. Selling to John for $80 is also not ideal, as I'm aiming to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $90. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll reduce the price to $100. This is a more reasonable compromise, considering the product's quality and worth."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. $100 is still higher than I'd like. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. While $95 is getting closer to my target, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob, considering he values the product at $120. Selling to John for $80 is still not a viable option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. You've moved up from $90 to $95, which shows you're interested in the product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to feel that we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial price. I'll meet you at $98, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 98}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close! $98 is almost there, but I'm trying to stick to my budget. Would you consider $96? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Bob is very close to my desired price range, and I believe he's willing to pay more since he's continued to negotiate and increase his offer. $96 is a good sign, but I think I can still get a bit more. Selling to John for $80 is not an option at this point, as I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to an agreement. I appreciate your budget constraints, but I also need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Since you've come up to $96, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'll sell the product to you for $97. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value and our negotiations so far. I hope this price works for you."", ""product_price"": 97}"
