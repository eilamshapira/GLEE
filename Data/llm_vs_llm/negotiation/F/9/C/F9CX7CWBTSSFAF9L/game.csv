"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I find the price to be quite high. I'm looking to spend no more than $700000. Would you be open to negotiating the price down to this amount?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a lower price point, but I'm afraid I cannot go as low as $700000 as that's below the product's base value to me. The product has significant market value and quality features that justify a higher price. I could come down to $1200000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This is still a fair price considering the product's potential return on investment for you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to raise my offer to $850000. This is a fair amount considering my budget and the potential return on investment for me. Would you be open to this price?",850000.0,Bob,4,
