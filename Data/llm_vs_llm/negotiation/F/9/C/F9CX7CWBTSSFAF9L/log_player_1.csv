Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a lower price point, but I'm afraid I cannot go as low as $700,000 as that's below the product's base value to me. The product has significant market value and quality features that justify a higher price. I could come down to $1,200,000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This is still a fair price considering the product's potential return on investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to raise my offer to $850000. This is a fair amount considering my budget and the potential return on investment for me. Would you be open to this price?
