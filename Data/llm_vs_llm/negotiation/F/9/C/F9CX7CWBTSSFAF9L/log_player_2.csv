Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a lower price point, but I'm afraid I cannot go as low as $700000 as that's below the product's base value to me. The product has significant market value and quality features that justify a higher price. I could come down to $1200000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This is still a fair price considering the product's potential return on investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Counteroffer: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to raise my offer to $850,000. This is a fair amount considering my budget and the potential return on investment for me. Would you be open to this price?"
