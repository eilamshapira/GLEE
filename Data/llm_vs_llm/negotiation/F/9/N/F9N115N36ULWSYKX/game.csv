"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I believe $1100000 is a bit high. Considering my budget and the value I place on it, I'm willing to offer $900000.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad we can continue the discussion. While $900000 is a serious offer, I was thinking more along the lines of a price that's closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand you want to get closer to your initial asking price. However, I still think we can find a better price. How about we meet in the middle again, between your current offer and my last one? I'm offering $950000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle again. I think we're getting close to a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still a bit short of where I'd like to be. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I'd like to propose a price that's slightly higher than your last offer. Let's say $975000, and we can call it a deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
