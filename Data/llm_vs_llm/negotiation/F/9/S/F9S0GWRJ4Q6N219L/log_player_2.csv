Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I find the price to be quite high. I'm willing to purchase the product for $50."", ""product_price"": 50}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. However, I find the price of $50 to be too low. I'm willing to lower my initial price, but I need to get a better offer from you. Let me propose a new price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $220

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. However, I still find the price of $60 to be too low. I'm willing to continue negotiating and find a mutually beneficial price. Let me propose a new price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

(Alice's new offer is still much higher than the price of $80 from Jhon. I don't think further negotiation with Alice will result in a better price than what John is offering. It's best to buy from John and save money.)"
