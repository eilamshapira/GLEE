"Hello Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a fair price for the product. Let's meet in the middle.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $150 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we split the difference from our last offers? Would you be willing to do $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I see you're willing to split the difference, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I can do slightly better than $150, but I need to get at least closer to my original offer. How about $140?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but I have a budget in mind. I can go up to $100, but that's really my limit.  It's a fair offer considering my initial offer and John's price.",100.0,Bob,6,
