"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $80 is too low for me, and I have a better option to sell to John for $120 if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a fair price for the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $150 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we split the difference from our last offers? Would you be willing to do $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Although $115 is closer to my minimum price, I still think I can get a better deal, and selling to John for $120 is a viable option if the negotiation doesn't improve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I see you're willing to split the difference, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I can do slightly better than $150, but I need to get at least closer to my original offer. How about $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but I have a budget in mind. I can go up to $100, but that's really my limit.  It's a fair offer considering my initial offer and John's price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer of $100 is too low, and I have a better option to sell the product to John for $120, which is above my minimum price. It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Bob if I can get a higher price from John."
