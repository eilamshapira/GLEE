"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given that Alice's offer is $2,000,000, which is higher than the product's worth to me ($1,000,000) and also higher than John's price ($1,000,000), the best decision is to buy from John.
