"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for the first round:

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Given that my minimum acceptable price is $12,000 and Bob is offering $10,000, I have to reject his offer. I'll also choose to continue negotiating for now, hoping to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","This is a crucial decision point. Bob is now offering my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I could potentially negotiate further, but I also have the option to sell to John for the same amount.

Since I don't know how Bob values the product, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely, I'll choose to accept Bob's offer. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
