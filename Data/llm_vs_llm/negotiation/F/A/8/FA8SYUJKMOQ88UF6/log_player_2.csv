"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $20,000 is way too high, considering the product is only worth $8,000 to me, and I have the option to buy from John for $8,000. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 6000}

I'll offer $6,000, which is below both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000). This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to save money compared to buying from John. If Alice rejects this, we can try to find a middle ground, but I always have John's offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $17,000 is still far above my maximum value of $8,000, and I can still buy from John for $8,000. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. Alice has shown some flexibility by reducing the price from $20,000 to $17,000, but it's still not close enough to a reasonable price for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 7000}

I'll increase my offer to $7,000. This is still below my maximum value and John's price, but shows willingness to negotiate by moving up from my previous offer of $6,000. Since Alice moved down from her initial offer, I'm moving up to show good faith in the negotiation. However, I still have the safety net of John's $8,000 offer if we can't reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

While Alice has continued to lower her price (from $20,000 to $17,000 to $15,000), it's still nearly double my maximum value of $8,000. Given that we're already in round 5 and the price is still far above what I'm willing to pay, it seems unlikely that we'll reach an agreement at a price below $8,000. Since I can buy from John for $8,000, which is my maximum value, I'll take that option rather than continue negotiations that may not lead to a better outcome."
