I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer at $950,000.  This is a compromise, closer to his offer but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I believe this is a fair offer that still leaves room for potential agreement."
