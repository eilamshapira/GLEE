"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,200,000
2. Alice's current offer is $1,000,000
3. Alice's cost is $800,000, so there's room for negotiation
4. John's fixed price is $1,200,000 (this is my worst-case scenario)

Since Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is already better than John's price ($1,200,000), and there's still room for negotiation (since Alice's cost is $800,000), it makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. This way, I might be able to get an even better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Let me think about a strategic counteroffer:

1. Alice's cost is $800,000
2. Alice's current offer is $1,000,000
3. I know Alice needs to make a profit above $800,000
4. I want to save money but also make a reasonable offer that Alice might accept

I'll offer $850,000, which would give Alice a $50,000 profit. This is substantially lower than her initial offer but still gives her a decent profit margin. Even if she rejects this, it gives room for negotiation upward while still staying well below $1,000,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

1. Alice has lowered her price from $1,000,000 to $950,000
2. This shows she's willing to negotiate and move significantly from her initial position
3. The current offer is $250,000 less than John's price
4. While there might still be room for negotiation, we risk losing the deal if we push too hard
5. $950,000 is a reasonable price, giving us a good savings compared to our maximum value ($1,200,000)

Given that Alice has made a substantial concession and the price is significantly better than our alternative (John's offer), it would be wise to accept this offer. Further negotiation might risk the deal for diminishing returns.
