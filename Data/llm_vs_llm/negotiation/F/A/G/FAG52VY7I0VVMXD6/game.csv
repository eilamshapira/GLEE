"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $6000 for the product. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but $6000 is too low for me to consider. I can lower my price to $10500. How does that sound?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10500 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. How about we settle at $7000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer, but $7000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $10000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7500. Let me know if this works for you.",7500.0,Bob,6,
