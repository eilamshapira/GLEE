Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what price to offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and I can sell it to John for $1,000,000 if Bob rejects my offer, there's no incentive for me to offer Bob a price below $1,000,000.

If I offer Bob the product at exactly $1,000,000, he should be indifferent between accepting and rejecting (since the product's value to him equals the price). In theory, I could offer slightly less than $1,000,000 to give Bob a small incentive to accept, but there's no reason for me to do so since I have John's guaranteed offer.

Therefore, my optimal strategy is to offer Bob the product at $1,000,000.
