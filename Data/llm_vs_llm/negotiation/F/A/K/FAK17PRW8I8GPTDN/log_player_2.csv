"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $120, it would not be rational to accept her offer. John is offering the same product for $80, which matches my maximum valuation.
