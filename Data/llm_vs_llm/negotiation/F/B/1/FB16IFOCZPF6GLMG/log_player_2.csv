"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given the information, Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than my maximum value for the product ($80) and also higher than John's price of $80. 

Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible while obtaining the product, and John is offering the product at exactly my maximum valuation, I should buy from John rather than accept Alice's overpriced offer or engage in a negotiation that might not come down to a better price.
