"Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $2500000. This is a one-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested.",2500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm certainly interested in the product, but the price you've set is beyond my budget. I can offer you $500000, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiations.",500000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $500000 is significantly below the value of the product to me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need a higher offer. Let's continue our discussion in the next round.",1500000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to lower my initial offer to $2000000. This is still a significant discount from my first proposal, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Please let me know if this works for you.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but we are still quite far apart. I can increase my offer to $600000, considering the constraints I have. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",600000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your increased offer, Bob. However, $600000 is still not reflective of the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1750000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and should be within a reasonable range for us to close the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're trying to find common ground. To show my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to further reduce the price to $1600000. This is very close to my minimum acceptable value, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. Please consider this offer carefully.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you, Alice, for your flexibility. Unfortunately, $1600000 is still above my limit. I can stretch a bit more and offer you $700000. I hope we can reach a deal at this price. Let me know your thoughts.",700000.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to increase your offer, but $700000 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to go down to $1550000, which is just above my minimum threshold. This is my final offer before considering other options. Please let me know if this works for you.",1550000.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. Given the value of the product and my need to meet a certain threshold, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1525000. This is as low as I can go while still maintaining the integrity of the deal. Please let me know if this is something you can work with.",1525000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your patience in these negotiations. I understand the value you see in the product, but my budget is limited. My final offer is $750000. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",750000.0,Bob,8,
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but $750000 is still significantly below what I can accept. I'm willing to go down to $1510000, which is the lowest I can possibly go. If this doesn't work for you, I will have to consider other options. Please let me know your decision.",1510000.0,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're nearing the end of our negotiation window. I'm willing to make one last compromise at $1505000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I need a decision from you. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider selling to another buyer.",1505000.0,Alice,9,
