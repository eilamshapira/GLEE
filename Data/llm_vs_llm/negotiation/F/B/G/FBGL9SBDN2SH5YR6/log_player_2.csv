"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this situation:

- The product is worth up to $150 to me (maximum value I place on it)
- Alice is offering it for $130
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $150

Alice's offer of $130 is $20 less than John's price of $150. Since Alice's offer is below my maximum valuation and cheaper than the alternative option, accepting her offer would be the rational choice.
