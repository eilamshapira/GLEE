"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20000. I believe it's a fair price, considering the product's quality and potential benefits. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my market research and the product's features, I would like to make a counteroffer of $7500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's actual market value. I'm open to further discussion.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate the time you took to research the market and make an informed decision. However, I must say that $7500 is a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. Considering the product's exceptional quality and potential benefits, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe this price is more in line with the product's true value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $18000 is still significantly above what I can justify paying for this product. While I understand you value the product's quality, I need to stay within my budget constraints. I can raise my offer to $8500. This represents a $1000 increase from my previous offer and is a price that I believe is fair for both parties.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the increase to $8500, but I still believe the product's value is not being fully reflected in this price. I'm willing to continue negotiating and finding a mutually beneficial agreement. With that in mind, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16000. This price takes into account your budget constraints while still acknowledging the product's exceptional quality and potential benefits.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for continuing to work with me, Alice. I acknowledge your willingness to reduce the price, but $16000 is still well beyond what I can spend. I should be transparent - I have another seller offering this product for $10000, but I'm negotiating with you because I prefer to do business with you. I can raise my offer to $9500, which is very close to my absolute maximum budget. I hope we can find common ground near this price point.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your transparency regarding the other seller's offer. I appreciate your preference to do business with me, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering your maximum budget is near $9500, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000. However, I'm also willing to throw in a concession - if you're willing to meet me at $14000, I'll include a premium service package that will enhance the product's value and provide you with additional support. If this is still not feasible, I'm open to further negotiations.",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer of the premium service package, Alice, and your continued willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be firm about my budget constraints - I cannot go above $10000 for this purchase, regardless of additional services. Given that I can get the product elsewhere for $10000, my final offer is $9800. This is absolutely the highest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price that would still give you a better return than losing the sale completely. If we can't reach an agreement at this price point, I'll unfortunately need to pursue other options.",9800.0,Bob,8,
