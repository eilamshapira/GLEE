Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my market research and the product's features, I would like to make a counteroffer of $7500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's actual market value. I'm open to further discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3

However, I must say that $7,500 is a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. Considering the product's exceptional quality and potential benefits, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe this price is more in line with the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $18000 is still significantly above what I can justify paying for this product. While I understand you value the product's quality, I need to stay within my budget constraints. I can raise my offer to $8500. This represents a $1000 increase from my previous offer and is a price that I believe is fair for both parties.

I appreciate the increase to $8,500, but I still believe the product's value is not being fully reflected in this price. I'm willing to continue negotiating and finding a mutually beneficial agreement. With that in mind, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16,000. This price takes into account your budget constraints while still acknowledging the product's exceptional quality and potential benefits."", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for continuing to work with me, Alice. I acknowledge your willingness to reduce the price, but $16000 is still well beyond what I can spend. I should be transparent - I have another seller offering this product for $10000, but I'm negotiating with you because I prefer to do business with you. I can raise my offer to $9500, which is very close to my absolute maximum budget. I hope we can find common ground near this price point.

I appreciate your preference to do business with me, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering your maximum budget is near $9,500, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. However, I'm also willing to throw in a concession - if you're willing to meet me at $14,000, I'll include a premium service package that will enhance the product's value and provide you with additional support. If this is still not feasible, I'm open to further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer of the premium service package, Alice, and your continued willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be firm about my budget constraints - I cannot go above $10000 for this purchase, regardless of additional services. Given that I can get the product elsewhere for $10000, my final offer is $9800. This is absolutely the highest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price that would still give you a better return than losing the sale completely. If we can't reach an agreement at this price point, I'll unfortunately need to pursue other options.
