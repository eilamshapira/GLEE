"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to make a decision based on the offers available to me. Let me analyze:

1. Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000
2. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me
3. John (alternative seller) is willing to sell it for $1,200,000
4. If I reject Alice's offer, I can make a counteroffer

Since Alice's current offer ($1,500,000) exceeds both my maximum value and John's price, there's no reason to accept it. I could try negotiating with Alice by making a counteroffer, but John's price already matches my maximum value. Therefore, the most rational decision is to go with the guaranteed option.
