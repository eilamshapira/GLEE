"Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $1000000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth the same amount to you. I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $500000 for the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $800000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $650000?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $650000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours, at $725000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal if you're serious about acquiring the product.",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $680000.  That's a significant move on my part, and I hope you'll consider it carefully.",680000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $680000 is still below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $700000.  This is my final offer.  If you're serious about making this deal happen, let's close it at this price.",700000.0,Alice,7,
