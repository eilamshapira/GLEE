Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $680000 is still below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $700000.  This is my final offer.  If you're serious about making this deal happen, let's close it at this price.

It's always a gamble to push further when someone says ""final offer,"" and while I could try for a slightly lower price, $700,000 is a good deal compared to my alternative (John at $1,000,000)."
