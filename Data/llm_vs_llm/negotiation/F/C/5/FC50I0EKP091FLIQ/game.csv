"Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I'm afraid $2000000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1500000 to me, which happens to be the exact price that another seller, John, is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product, which would give you a quick sale while saving me from having to go with John's offer.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
