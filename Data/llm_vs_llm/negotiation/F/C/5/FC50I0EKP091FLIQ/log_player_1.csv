"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive rights to this incredible product. Based on its unparalleled value, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fantastic opportunity. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I'm afraid $2000000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1500000 to me, which happens to be the exact price that another seller, John, is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product, which would give you a quick sale while saving me from having to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Considering Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price, here's my decision for Round 2:
