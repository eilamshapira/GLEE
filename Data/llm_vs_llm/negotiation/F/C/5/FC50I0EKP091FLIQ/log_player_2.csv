"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive rights to this incredible product. Based on its unparalleled value, I'm offering it to you for $2000000. I believe this is a fantastic opportunity. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $2,000,000 exceeds the maximum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me, and is also higher than John's guaranteed price of $1,500,000, I should reject this offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I'm afraid $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, which happens to be the exact price that another seller, John, is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product, which would give you a quick sale while saving me from having to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
