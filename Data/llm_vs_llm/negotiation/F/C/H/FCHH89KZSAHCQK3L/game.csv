,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $300 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Based on my market research, similar products are selling for much less. I would be willing to pay $90 for the product.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go that low. Considering the quality and features, this product is worth much more. How about we meet in the middle at $250?",250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $250 is still well above what I can justify spending. The market has similar products at much lower prices. I can increase my offer to $110, which I believe is fair considering the market conditions.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $110 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still at $230. This is a fantastic product, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it once you use it.",230.0,Alice,5,
