"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to let it go for $300."", ""product_price"": 300}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $300 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Based on my market research, similar products are selling for much less. I would be willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Considering my minimum acceptable price is $150 and Bob's offer is only $90, I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go that low. Considering the quality and features, this product is worth much more. How about we meet in the middle at $250?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $250 is still well above what I can justify spending. The market has similar products at much lower prices. I can increase my offer to $110, which I believe is fair considering the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Again, Bob's offer is below my minimum. I'm going to reject and counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my next counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $110 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still at $230. This is a fantastic product, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it once you use it."", ""product_price"": 230}"
