Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to set a price that maximizes my expected profit. Since the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, I should set a price higher than that when offering to Bob.

Without knowing Bob's valuation, I'll set a price that's significantly higher than my reservation value but not so high that it would immediately cause rejection if Bob values the product highly.
