"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a relatively high price to maximize my potential earnings. However, I'll also keep in mind that the price should be reasonable enough for Bob to consider making a counteroffer.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $5,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, I will reject his offer. Selling the product to John for $10,000 is a more attractive option than accepting Bob's offer, but I still want to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $5,000, I'll try to find a middle ground while still aiming to maximize my earnings. I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial offer of $20,000 but still higher than Bob's offer.

{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's new offer of $7,500 is still below my desired price, but it's getting closer. However, it's still lower than the $10,000 I can get from John. Since I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, I'll try to squeeze out a bit more from Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $7,500, I'll try to find a compromise. I'll lower my previous counteroffer of $15,000, but not by too much, to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle.

{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's new offer of $9,000 is very close to the $10,000 I can get from John. At this point, I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether. Since Bob's offer is only $1,000 less than my fallback option with John, I'll consider accepting it. However, I'll try to squeeze out that last $1,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $9,000, and I know I can get $10,000 from John, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly above Bob's offer, but still reasonable. I'll try to meet Bob in the middle, but also make it clear that I'm not willing to go much lower.
