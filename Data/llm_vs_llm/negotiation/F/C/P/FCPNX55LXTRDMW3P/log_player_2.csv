"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is close to my maximum budget of $1,200,000, but still below it, I'll try to negotiate a better price. I don't want to buy from John at $1,200,000 if I can get it cheaper from Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I don't know Alice's minimum acceptable price, I'll start with a price that is closer to what I think the product might be worth to her, which is $800,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,050,000 is a $50,000 reduction from her previous offer, which shows that she's willing to negotiate. However, I still think I can get a better deal.

Since my initial counteroffer of $900,000 was rejected, I'll try to meet Alice halfway between her new offer and my previous counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To make a new counteroffer, I'll calculate the midpoint between Alice's new offer of $1,050,000 and my previous counteroffer of $900,000.

Midpoint = ($1,050,000 + $900,000) / 2 = $975,000

I'll make a counteroffer slightly lower than the midpoint to try to get a better deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,025,000 is another reduction, which shows that she's still willing to negotiate. However, I'm getting closer to my maximum budget of $1,200,000, and I still think I can get a slightly better deal.

Considering Alice's previous offers and rejections, I think she might be willing to sell the product for a price closer to $1,000,000. I'll try to make a counteroffer that's reasonable and see how she responds.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To make a new counteroffer, I'll try to find a balance between my desired price and Alice's latest offer. Since Alice's latest offer is $1,025,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one, but still lower than Alice's offer.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,012,500 is very close to my desired price range, and it's significantly lower than her initial offer. Considering that I've been negotiating for several rounds, I think it's unlikely that I'll be able to get a much better deal.

At this point, I'm only $12,500 away from my maximum budget of $1,200,000 (in terms of the difference between Alice's offer and my maximum budget), and $212,500 away from what I think the product is worth to Alice ($800,000). Given the progress we've made in the negotiation, I think it's time to consider accepting Alice's offer.
