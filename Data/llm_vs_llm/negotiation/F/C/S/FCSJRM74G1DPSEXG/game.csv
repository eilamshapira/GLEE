"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for a price that reflects its true market value.  I'm confident that we can find a price that's fair for both of us.  I'd like to propose a price of $850000.  This takes into account the value you've placed on the product and allows for a healthy profit margin for you. Let's see if we can work together to make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,2,
