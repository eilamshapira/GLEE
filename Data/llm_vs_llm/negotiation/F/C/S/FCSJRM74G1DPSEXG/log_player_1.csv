"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will bring great value to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to let it go for a price that I think is fair and reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for a price that reflects its true market value.  I'm confident that we can find a price that's fair for both of us.  I'd like to propose a price of $850000.  This takes into account the value you've placed on the product and allows for a healthy profit margin for you. Let's see if we can work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, as I believe the product's value is higher than $850,000 and I can get a better price. Selling to John for $800,000 is not the best option at this point, as Bob's offer is already higher than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than your proposed price. Considering your interest in the product and its market value, I'm willing to make a concession and offer it to you for a slightly lower price than my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 920000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $920000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $880000. This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, as I believe the product's value is higher than $880,000 and I can get a better price. Bob is willing to negotiate and has increased his offer, which indicates that he is interested in the product and may be willing to go higher. Selling to John for $800,000 is still not the best option, as Bob's offer is already higher than that."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I still believe the product's value is slightly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for a price that's closer to your target, but still reflects the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution.  I believe we're very close to a deal. I'm willing to go up to $890000. This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I will accept Bob's offer of $890,000. We have been negotiating for several rounds, and Bob has consistently increased his offer. At this point, I believe that $890,000 is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and it's unlikely that I can get a significantly better offer from Bob. Additionally, this price is higher than John's offer of $800,000, so it's the best option available to me."
