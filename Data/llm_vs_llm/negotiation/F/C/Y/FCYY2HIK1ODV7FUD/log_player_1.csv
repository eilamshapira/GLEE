"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm very excited to offer you this incredible product. Considering its exceptional quality and rarity, I'm asking for $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer, but $20000 is above my budget. I am willing to pay $9000 for the product considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Okay, Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.

Considering my options:

*   **Accept Bob's offer:** This means selling for $9,000.
*   **Reject Bob's offer:** This gives me another chance to negotiate, but risks Bob walking away or me having to lower my price further.
*   **Sell to John:** This guarantees me $12,000 now.

Given the circumstances, I believe it's best to hold out for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting the price, but $18000 is still beyond my budget. I can offer $10000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value to me.
