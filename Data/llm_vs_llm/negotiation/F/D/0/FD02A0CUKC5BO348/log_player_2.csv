"Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer and make a decision that maximizes my savings.

Looking at the options:
- Alice is offering the product for $999,999
- John is selling it for $1,000,000
- The product is worth up to $1,000,000 to me

Alice's offer is only $1 cheaper than John's price. While it does save me a small amount, I should first reject Alice's offer to see if she might come back with a better price, knowing that her cost is only $800,000.
