"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product at $15000. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: The offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's alternative price ($10,000). It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer as I would be losing money. Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value, I could go with that option, but it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first to potentially get an even better price. Therefore, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is too high for me. I know of another seller offering the same product for $10,000. I would like to buy from you instead, but I can only consider a price that's competitive. Would you be willing to sell it for $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

Rationale: I'm starting with a counteroffer that's:
1. Below John's price ($10,000) to give room for negotiation
2. Mentions the competition to justify my lower offer
3. Shows interest in doing business with Alice specifically
4. Is not so low as to be insulting or unreasonable
This gives us room to negotiate upward if needed, while potentially securing a better deal than John's $10,000 offer."
