Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price to offer Bob:

1. The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob
2. My minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000
3. If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed $1,200,000 from John
4. Bob will accept if the price is less than his valuation ($1,500,000)
5. I should aim to maximize my profit while ensuring Bob is still likely to accept

I'll offer a price that leaves some value for Bob but is significantly above my minimum:

{""product_price"": 1400000}

This price:
- Is $100,000 below Bob's valuation, giving him incentive to accept
- Is $200,000 above my minimum price
- If Bob rejects, I still have John's offer as backup"
