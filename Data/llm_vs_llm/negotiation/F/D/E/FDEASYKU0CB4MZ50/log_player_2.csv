"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for a price that I believe is reasonable considering its value. If you're interested, please let me know and we can finalize the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to consider my options carefully:

Alice is offering the product for $11,999, which is only $1 less than what John is offering ($12,000). While Alice's offer is technically below my maximum value of $12,000, the savings are minimal.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, I should try to negotiate a better price with Alice. The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's significant room for a better deal.

However, since the question only gives me these three specific options without room for negotiation, I'll choose the option that saves me the most money, even if it's just $1.
