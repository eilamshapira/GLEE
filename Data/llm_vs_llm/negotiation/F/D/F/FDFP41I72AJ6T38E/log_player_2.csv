"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $900,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept it. I could try to negotiate with Alice by rejecting and making a counteroffer, but since John is already offering the product at my maximum value of $800,000, it would be most rational to take John's guaranteed offer rather than risk further negotiation.
