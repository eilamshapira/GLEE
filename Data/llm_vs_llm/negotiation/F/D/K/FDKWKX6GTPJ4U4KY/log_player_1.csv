Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $12,000 to Bob
2. The product is worth at least $10,000 to me
3. I have a guaranteed backup offer of $10,000 from John
4. Bob will only accept if the price is less than or equal to $12,000

To maximize my profit while ensuring a high likelihood of acceptance, I should offer a price slightly below Bob's maximum value of $12,000.
