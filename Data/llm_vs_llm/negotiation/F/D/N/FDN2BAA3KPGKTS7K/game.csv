"Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I believe a fair price would be $12000, considering the market and the product's features.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in the product, Bob. While I understand budget considerations, I need to point out that this product is premium quality with exceptional features. $12000 is my absolute minimum threshold for this item, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you. I can reduce my asking price to $17500, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value and quality of the product.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me and the discount you've offered. However, $17500 is still above my budget. Considering you mentioned $12000 is your minimum threshold, I'd like to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to offer $13500 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise.",13500.0,Bob,4,
