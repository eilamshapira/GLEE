Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in the product, Bob. While I understand budget considerations, I need to point out that this product is premium quality with exceptional features. $12000 is my absolute minimum threshold for this item, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount.

This price better reflects the true value and quality of the product.
