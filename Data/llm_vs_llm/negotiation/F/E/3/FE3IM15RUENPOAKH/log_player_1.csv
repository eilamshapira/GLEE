Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic offer that maximizes my potential profit while still being potentially acceptable to Bob. Since I know I have a guaranteed backup offer of $1,500,000 from John, I can make a higher offer to Bob without risk. A reasonable approach would be to offer the product at a significantly higher price.
