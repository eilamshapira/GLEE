"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $12,000.

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me (Bob).
Alice is offering the product for $12,000.
If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $12,000.

Since both Alice and John are offering the exact same price ($12,000), and the product is worth up to that amount to me, I'm indifferent between the two options. I might as well accept Alice's offer since there's no price advantage in going to John.
