"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your transparency regarding your budget. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. I believe this price better reflects the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations if this is still out of your budget.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1800000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'd like to propose a price of $1500000, but I'm willing to go slightly above that to $1550000 if it means we can finalize the deal. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
