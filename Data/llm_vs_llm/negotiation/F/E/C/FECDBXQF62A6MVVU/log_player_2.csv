Alice's offer is much higher than both your budget and what you could pay John.  It's time to negotiate."

Alice is coming down, but it's still too high. I'll counter again."

Alice is slowly coming down, but I'm still not willing to pay that much over my alternative. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's price."
