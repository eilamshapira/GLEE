Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $10,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 (which I can get from John), but I'll continue negotiating with Bob since there's still potential to get a better price than John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still maintain a price significantly above John's guarantee to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit potential.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer equals John's offer ($15,000), and there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer in future rounds, I'll accept Bob's current offer. There's no advantage in continuing negotiations when we've reached a price equal to my guaranteed alternative.
