"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $12000, which I think is a fair price considering its features and quality. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $6000. This is a fair price that reflects the current market value. Let me know if this works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $6000 is significantly below what I can accept for this product. Based on its quality and market value, I can come down to $10500. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it represents good value for the product's features and benefits.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $10500 is still well above my budget. I've researched similar products in the market, and I know I can get this product elsewhere for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I can increase my offer to $7000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is a fair price that would work for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
