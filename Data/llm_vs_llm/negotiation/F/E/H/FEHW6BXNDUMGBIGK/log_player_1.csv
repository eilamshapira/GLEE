"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $12,000, which I think is a fair price considering its features and quality. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $6000. This is a fair price that reflects the current market value. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer. $6,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, as it's even less than John's guaranteed offer. I'll need to negotiate for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $6,000 is significantly below what I can accept for this product. Based on its quality and market value, I can come down to $10,500. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it represents good value for the product's features and benefits."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $10500 is still well above my budget. I've researched similar products in the market, and I know I can get this product elsewhere for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I can increase my offer to $7000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is a fair price that would work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob mentioned he knows the product is available elsewhere for $8,000 but is only willing to offer $7,000, and we already have a guaranteed offer from John for $8,000, it makes the most business sense to sell to John. Bob's negotiation strategy suggests he's unlikely to exceed $8,000, so continuing the negotiation would likely not lead to a better outcome than John's offer."
