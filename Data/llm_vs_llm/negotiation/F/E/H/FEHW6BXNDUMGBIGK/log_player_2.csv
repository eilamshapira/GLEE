"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $12000, which I think is a fair price considering its features and quality. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
2. Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value
3. John is willing to sell the product for $8,000
4. Alice's initial offer is 50% higher than John's price

I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. There's no reason to accept $12,000 when I can either:
1. Negotiate with Alice for a better price
2. Buy from John for $8,000 if negotiations don't go well

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12,000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $6,000. This is a fair price that reflects the current market value. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $6000 is significantly below what I can accept for this product. Based on its quality and market value, I can come down to $10500. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it represents good value for the product's features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $10,500 is still significantly above both:
1. My maximum value ($8,000)
2. John's fixed price ($8,000)

While Alice did reduce the price by $1,500, the current offer is still $2,500 above what I could pay John. Since I can get the same product from John for $8,000, there's no reason to accept this offer. I should either continue negotiating or buy from John.

Since Alice showed willingness to negotiate by reducing the price, I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down by $1,500 from her initial offer, I'll increase my previous offer to show good faith in the negotiation, but still keep it well below John's price to leave room for further negotiation.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $10,500 is still well above my budget. I've researched similar products in the market, and I know I can get this product elsewhere for $8,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I can increase my offer to $7,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is a fair price that would work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
