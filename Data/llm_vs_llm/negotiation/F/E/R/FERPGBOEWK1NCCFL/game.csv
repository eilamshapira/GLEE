"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $9000?  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $9000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Let me make another offer. How about $10500? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and is a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $10000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $9500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm eager to finalize this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet in the middle, and I appreciate that. Let's try to close the gap a bit more. How about $9800? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and should work well within your budget.",9800.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're getting closer to an agreement. Let's make it $9700. This price is a small step down from my last offer and should be within your budget while still reflecting the product's value.",9700.0,Alice,5,
