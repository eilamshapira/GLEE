"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $6000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest, but unfortunately, I cannot accept $6000 for the product. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $12000. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $12000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $7000, which is the highest I'm comfortable paying at this point. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I cannot sell the product for $7000. Would you be able to consider $10000? I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $10000 is still above my budget. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $7500. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options. Let me know your thoughts.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your patience, Bob. I appreciate your increase to $7500, but unfortunately, I still cannot accept that price. How about we compromise on $9000? I believe this is a fair offer that values the product appropriately. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,7,
