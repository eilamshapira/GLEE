"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is higher than both:
1. The maximum value the product is worth to me ($1,000,000)
2. John's guaranteed price ($1,000,000)

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer or continue negotiating. The best decision is to buy from John.
