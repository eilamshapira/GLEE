Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if Bob can increase his offer. I can always sell to John for $15,000 if Bob's future offers are not satisfactory."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 22000}

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a price closer to what I would get from John. I am open to negotiating further, but I want to ensure I get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low. I will continue negotiating to see if he can come closer to my expected value. If not, I can always sell to John. Let's see how Bob responds to a more modest counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 18000}

I'm willing to come down further from my original price, but I still want to make a good profit. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle. If Bob does not accept this counteroffer, I will consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still too low, and I don't see him reaching a price that is acceptable to me. It's better to sell to John for $15,000 rather than risk getting into further rounds of bargaining.  The rounds of bargaining left are not enough to expect Bob to reach the price of $15,000."
