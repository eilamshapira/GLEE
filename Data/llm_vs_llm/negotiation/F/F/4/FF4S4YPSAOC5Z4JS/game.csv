"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is too low considering the value this product offers. I can come down from my initial price - how about $130? This is still a good deal given the product's market value.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you moving up in your offer. While I want to work with you, I need to ensure I'm getting fair value for this product. How about we settle at $125? This gives you a significant value while still being reasonable for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
