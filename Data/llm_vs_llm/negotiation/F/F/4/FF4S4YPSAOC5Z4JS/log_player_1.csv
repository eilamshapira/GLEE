"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a wonderful product that I believe would be very valuable to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $140. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $105 is too close to my minimum value, and I know the product is worth more to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is too low considering the value this product offers. I can come down from my initial price - how about $130? This is still a good deal given the product's market value."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product but I'm on a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make another counteroffer. $115 is better, but since the product is worth $150 to Bob, there's still room for a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you moving up in your offer. While I want to work with you, I need to ensure I'm getting fair value for this product. How about we settle at $125? This gives you a significant value while still being reasonable for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle on $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $120. While I might theoretically get a bit more, this is a good compromise that gives both of us value. It's significantly better than my alternative of selling to John for $100, and continuing to negotiate further might risk losing the deal altogether."
