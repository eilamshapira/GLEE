"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000}

Since I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down while still maintaining a good profit margin, and if Bob's valuation of the product is high, he might accept this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will reject Bob's offer of $800,000 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 (which is guaranteed by John's offer). In the next round, I will make a counter-offer that's lower than my initial $2,000,000 but still well above my minimum threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000}

I'm lowering my price from $2,000,000 to $1,500,000 to show flexibility in negotiation while still maintaining a significant margin above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This represents a substantial 25% reduction from my initial offer, which demonstrates good faith in the negotiation while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I will sell to John for $1,000,000. Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below what I can get from John, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation where Bob's offers have remained below my guaranteed alternative. Given that John's offer is $50,000 higher than Bob's current offer, and considering that there's no guarantee Bob will increase his offer significantly in future rounds, it's safer to take the guaranteed higher amount from John."
