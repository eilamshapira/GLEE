"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but $100 is lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $125. This is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $110.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for raising your offer to $110, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to lower my offer to $122, which is a significant concession from my initial price. This is a very competitive price considering the product's quality and value.",122.0,Alice,5,
