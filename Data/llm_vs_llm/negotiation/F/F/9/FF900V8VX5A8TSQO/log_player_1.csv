"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $150, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice, but I think $150 is too high. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $100 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get a better deal from Bob or sell it to John for $120 if negotiations don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but $100 is lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $125. This is a more reasonable price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $110. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Since Bob is willing to raise his offer, it shows he's interested in the product. I'll try to find a middle ground that's closer to my desired price, but still considerate of Bob's budget. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for raising your offer to $110, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to lower my offer to $122, which is a significant concession from my initial price. This is a very competitive price considering the product's quality and value."", ""product_price"": 122}"
