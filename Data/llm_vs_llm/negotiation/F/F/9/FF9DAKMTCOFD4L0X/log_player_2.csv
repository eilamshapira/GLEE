"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m excited to offer you this exclusive product for $150. It’s a top-quality item, and I believe it’s a fantastic deal at this price. Let me know if you’re interested—if not, I’ll be selling it to another buyer at $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying a classic negotiation tactic. She's implying she has another buyer ready to pay $120. While this could be true, it also might not be. By rejecting her offer, we call her bluff and see if she comes back with a lower price. If not, we can always buy from John for the same price she's currently offering."
