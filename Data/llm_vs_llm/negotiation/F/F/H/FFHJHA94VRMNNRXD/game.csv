"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth and I'm open to negotiations.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I understand that the product has exceptional value, but $12000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay a reasonable price, but I need to stay within my means. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $7000, considering the product's worth and my own financial constraints.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's exceptional value, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10500. I'm open to further negotiations to find a mutually agreeable price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $10500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $7500, which I believe is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised counteroffer. I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle. However, $7500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's exceptional value, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9500. I'm willing to make some concessions to reach a mutually agreeable price.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to make concessions. However, $9500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",8000.0,Bob,6,
