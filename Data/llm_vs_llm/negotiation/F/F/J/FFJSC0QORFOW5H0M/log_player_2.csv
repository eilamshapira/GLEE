"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you today. Based on its features and market value, I'm offering it at $12000. This product has proven to be very valuable to its users, and I believe it would be a great investment for you. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer of $12,000 is higher than both:
1. My maximum value for the product ($10,000)
2. John's guaranteed price ($10,000)

It would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. While I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, I already know I can get the product from John for $10,000, which is the maximum I value the product at. Therefore, the most logical decision is to buy from John.
