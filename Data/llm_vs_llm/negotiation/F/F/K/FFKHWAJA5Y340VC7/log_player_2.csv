"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since the offered price of $12,000 is higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($8,000), it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm willing to pay up to $8,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is somewhat lower than that to leave room for further negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $10,000 is still higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($8,000). While it's a better offer than the initial $12,000, it's still not within my budget.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $10,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between her offer and my previous counteroffer of $6,000. However, I'll also keep in mind that I don't want to exceed my maximum budget of $8,000.

Let's make a counteroffer of $7,000, which is still below my maximum budget and shows that I'm willing to compromise.

{""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $9,000 is still higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($8,000). At this point, I think it's clear that Alice is not willing to sell the product to me at a price that I'm comfortable with.

Given that I have the option to buy the product from John for $8,000, which is within my budget, I think it's time to stop negotiating with Alice and explore the alternative option.
