Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Okay, I need to decide. My options are:

*   **Accept Bob's offer:** Sell for $100.
*   **Reject Bob's offer:** Negotiate further, risk not selling at all, but potentially get more.
*   **Sell to John:** Guarantee $100.

Since the value to me is $100, and Bob's offer is $100, I could accept it. However, there's a chance I can get more from Bob if I negotiate further. Let's take that chance.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, let's try this:

{""product_price"": 125}"
