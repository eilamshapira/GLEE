"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out with this product. After evaluating the market and my budget constraints, I would like to counter with $900000. This represents a significant profit for you while still being within my budget parameters. I believe this is a fair price that works well for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer of $900000 is a good starting point, it doesn't quite reflect the full value this product will bring to your business. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer to $1050000. This represents a considerable discount from my first offer and takes into account your budget constraints while still recognizing the significant value you'll gain from this product. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. That shows good faith in our negotiation. However, I still feel there's a gap between what you're asking and what represents true market value for this product. I can increase my offer to $950000, which would provide you with a substantial profit while being more aligned with my budget constraints. This price point would allow me to allocate resources to implementation and integration, maximizing the value for both of us. I hope we can find common ground here.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for raising your offer to $950000. I can see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I appreciate your continued interest. However, I need to consider the true market value of this product. I'm willing to further reduce my asking price to $1000000. This represents a significant $200000 reduction from my initial offer and is a very competitive price considering the $1200000 value this product will bring to your business. This price point strikes a fair balance, allowing both of us to benefit from this transaction. I hope we can come to an agreement at this level.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price to $1000000. We're definitely getting closer to an agreement. I recognize the value this product offers, and I want to make sure we reach a deal that's beneficial for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $975000, which I believe represents a fair compromise between our positions. This would still provide you with a substantial profit while giving me some room in my budget for implementation costs. I'm hopeful we can finalize this deal at this price point and begin a successful business relationship.",975000.0,Bob,6,
