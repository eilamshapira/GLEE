"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I believe I can pay a bit less considering my budget. How about we settle at $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob. While $1200000 is a step in the right direction, I believe we can find a middle ground that works better for both of us. Given the product's proven value and potential return on investment for you, I'm willing to adjust my price to $1300000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider $1150000 for the product?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Thanks for your continued interest, Bob. I've carefully considered your offer of $1150000, but I believe we're still not quite at the optimal point for both parties. I can come down to $1250000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and provides excellent value given the product's potential returns. This is a very competitive price point that I hope you'll find agreeable.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
