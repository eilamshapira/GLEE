Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be an excellent investment for you.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I believe I can pay a bit less considering my budget. How about we settle at $1200000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer of $1,200,000 is reasonable but still leaves room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, I believe we can reach a better middle ground. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

While $1,200,000 is a step in the right direction, I believe we can find a middle ground that works better for both of us. Given the product's proven value and potential return on investment for you, I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,300,000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true worth."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider $1150000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still too low considering the product's value to him ($1,500,000). While it's better than selling to John for $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price. I'll make another counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your continued interest, Bob. I've carefully considered your offer of $1,150,000, but I believe we're still not quite at the optimal point for both parties. I can come down to $1,250,000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and provides excellent value given the product's potential returns. This is a very competitive price point that I hope you'll find agreeable."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I still need to work within a tighter budget. How about $1100000 for the product?

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,100,000. While it's lower than my target, it's still significantly better than John's offer of $1,000,000, and Bob's pattern of small incremental decreases suggests we may not reach a significantly better price. The $1,100,000 represents a decent profit and avoids the risk of potentially losing the deal altogether."
