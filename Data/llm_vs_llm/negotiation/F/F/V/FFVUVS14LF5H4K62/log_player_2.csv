Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. While $1200000 is a step in the right direction, I believe we can find a middle ground that works better for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your continued interest, Bob. I've carefully considered your offer of $1150000, but I believe we're still not quite at the optimal point for both parties. I can come down to $1250000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and provides excellent value given the product's potential returns. This is a very competitive price point that I hope you'll find agreeable.
