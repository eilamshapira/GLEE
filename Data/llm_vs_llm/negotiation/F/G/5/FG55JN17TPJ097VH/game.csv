"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $5000. Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $5000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18000, which I think is more reflective of the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $18000 is still too high for me. I'm really interested, but my maximum budget is $6000. Can we meet in the middle?",6000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet in the middle. I understand that $18000 is still out of your budget, but I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $15000, which I think is a fair reflection of the product's value. If you're truly interested, I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",15000.0,Alice,5,
