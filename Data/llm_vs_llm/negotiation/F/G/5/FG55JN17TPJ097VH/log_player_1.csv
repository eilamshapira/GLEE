Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $5000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $5000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and my minimum acceptable price. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. 

My counteroffer: $18,000. This price still reflects the product's value, but I'm showing willingness to negotiate by not increasing the price further from my initial offer."

I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $5,000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18000 is still too high for me. I'm really interested, but my maximum budget is $6000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob. While $6,000 is still lower than I'd like, I can see that Bob is interested and willing to negotiate. I'll try to meet him closer to the middle, but still ensure I get a fair price for the product.

My counteroffer: $15,000. This price is lower than my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise, but still higher than Bob's current offer, as I believe the product's value warrants it."
