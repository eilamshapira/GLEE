"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's fixed price ($800,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. Even if I make a counteroffer, Alice is unlikely to go below her minimum acceptable price (given the product is worth $1,200,000 to her). The best option is to buy from John.
