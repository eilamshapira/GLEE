"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is significantly above my budget. While I acknowledge the product's potential, I can offer $600000. This is my maximum offer, considering my financial constraints and alternative options.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $600000 is significantly below the product's true value. Given that I have a guaranteed offer of $1000000 from another buyer, I couldn't accept anything below that. However, I'm willing to negotiate and could reduce my initial asking price. I can offer the product for $1800000. This represents a substantial reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's worth.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you have other offers, but my budget remains a constraint. While I appreciate you lowering your price, $1800000 is still too high for me. Considering my alternative to buy a similar product for $800000, I can offer $700000. This is my best and final offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
