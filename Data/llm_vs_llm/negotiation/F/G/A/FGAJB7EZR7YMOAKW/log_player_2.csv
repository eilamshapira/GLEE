Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $600000 is significantly below the product's true value. Given that I have a guaranteed offer of $1000000 from another buyer, I couldn't accept anything below that. However, I'm willing to negotiate and could reduce my initial asking price. I can offer the product for $1800000. This represents a substantial reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's worth.
