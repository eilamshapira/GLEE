"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. It's a bit closer to my budget, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8200 is just too low for me. How about $8800? It's still a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a win-win situation.",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, I'm still a bit short of my target budget. I'd like to propose a price of $8400. I think it's a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to close the deal at this price.",8400.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $8400 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference and go with $8600. This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly.",8600.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I see we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. I'd like to propose a price of $8500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering our previous discussions.",8500.0,Bob,6,
