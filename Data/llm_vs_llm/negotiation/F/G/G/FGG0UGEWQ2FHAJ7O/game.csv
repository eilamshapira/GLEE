"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $20000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I believe the price of $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe this is a reasonable offer considering the product's market value.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept $12000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I have another buyer willing to pay $15000, but I'm offering you the opportunity first. I can lower my initial price to $17500, which I believe is still a fair price considering the product's value.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for lowering the price to $17500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. Given that you have another buyer willing to pay $15000 and I can also buy it from John for $15000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and $15000. I'd like to offer $13500 for the product.",13500.0,Bob,4,
