"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $20,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I believe the price of $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe this is a reasonable offer considering the product's market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and I can get that amount from John. However, I believe we can still negotiate with Bob to reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept $12,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I have another buyer willing to pay $15,000, but I'm offering you the opportunity first. I can lower my initial price to $17,500, which I believe is still a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for lowering the price to $17500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. Given that you have another buyer willing to pay $15000 and I can also buy it from John for $15000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and $15000. I'd like to offer $13500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $13,500 is still below what John is willing to pay ($15,000), and Bob is aware that I have another buyer at $15,000 but still offers less, it makes more sense to sell to John. There's no guarantee that further negotiations with Bob will result in a better price, and we've already gone through several rounds without reaching an agreement above $15,000."
