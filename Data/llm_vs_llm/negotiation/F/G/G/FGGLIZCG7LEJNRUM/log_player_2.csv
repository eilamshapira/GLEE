"Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $16,000
3. John is offering to sell it for $15,000
4. If I buy from Alice, I would be paying $1,000 more than my maximum value
5. If I buy from John, I would be paying exactly my maximum value

Since Alice's offer ($16,000) is higher than my maximum value ($15,000), and John offers exactly my maximum value, the rational choice would be to buy from John.
