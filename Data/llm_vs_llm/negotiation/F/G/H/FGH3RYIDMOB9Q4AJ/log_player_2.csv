"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer is the same as John's price ($15,000), and there's no advantage in accepting Alice's offer immediately, I should try to negotiate for a better price. I have 9 more rounds to potentially get a better deal from Alice, and I can always fall back to John's offer if needed.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low that it would be considered unreasonable. Since my maximum value is $15,000, I'll start at around 60% of that value.

{""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","This is a good development - Alice has reduced her price significantly from $15,000 to $12,500, which would save me $2,500 compared to John's offer. However, since Alice showed willingness to negotiate down from her initial price and we still have 7 rounds left, I'll try one more round of negotiation to see if I can get an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $15,000 to $12,500, showing significant flexibility, and my previous offer of $9,000 was rejected, I'll make a more reasonable counteroffer by meeting somewhere in the middle between my last offer ($9,000) and her current offer ($12,500).

{""product_price"": 10750}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down again to $11,500, which is a good price - it would save me $3,500 compared to John's offer. She's shown consistent willingness to reduce the price, but the reductions are getting smaller. Given that we've already gone through half of our negotiation rounds and there's a risk of Alice becoming less flexible or even raising her price if we push too hard, I should accept this offer.
