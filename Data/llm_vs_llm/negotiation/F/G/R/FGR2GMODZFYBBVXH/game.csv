"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is quite high for this product. I've found similar products in the market for much less. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90, which I believe is a fair price.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you've found similar products for less, but I believe this product has some unique features that make it more valuable. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a better price. Let's meet in the middle.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I understand this product may have unique features, I have a firm budget constraint and can't go above $110. This is still a fair price that would give you a reasonable profit, and I'm ready to make the purchase at this price.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $110. I'm getting closer to my target price, but I still need to get a bit more. Considering your budget constraint, I'm willing to make a small concession. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial price.",130.0,Alice,5,
