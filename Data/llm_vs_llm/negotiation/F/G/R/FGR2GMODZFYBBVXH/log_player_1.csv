Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is quite high for this product. I've found similar products in the market for much less. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90, which I believe is a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you've found similar products for less, but I believe this product has some unique features that make it more valuable. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a better price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I understand this product may have unique features, I have a firm budget constraint and can't go above $110. This is still a fair price that would give you a reasonable profit, and I'm ready to make the purchase at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer, as $110 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'll try to meet Bob in the middle again, between my previous offer of $150 and his offer of $110."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $110. I'm getting closer to my target price, but I still need to get a bit more.
