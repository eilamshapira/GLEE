"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $200 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $120 and also higher than John's price. It would be wise to reject and make a counteroffer, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice than the $120 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is quite high for this product. I've found similar products in the market for much less. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90, which I believe is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 90}

I'm starting with a lower offer of $90 to leave room for negotiation. Since my maximum value is $120 and John's price is $120, offering $90 gives me space to negotiate upward while potentially getting a better deal than John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you've found similar products for less, but I believe this product has some unique features that make it more valuable. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a better price. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $150 is still higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120). While Alice has made a significant reduction from the initial $200 offer, it's still not competitive with John's price. I'll reject and make another counteroffer to try to get a better deal, but if Alice doesn't come down to at least $120, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I understand this product may have unique features, I have a firm budget constraint and can't go above $110. This is still a fair price that would give you a reasonable profit, and I'm ready to make the purchase at this price."", ""product_price"": 110}

I'm offering $110 now, which is slightly below John's price of $120. This gives Alice an opportunity to make a sale while still giving me a better deal than John's offer. It's also a significant increase from my previous offer of $90, showing that I'm willing to negotiate in good faith."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $110. I'm getting closer to my target price, but I still need to get a bit more. Considering your budget constraint, I'm willing to make a small concession. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's best to buy from John. Alice's offer of $130 is still above both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120). While Alice has been negotiating and reducing the price, she seems unwilling to match or beat John's price. Since we've gone through several rounds of negotiation and Alice is still above $120, it's unlikely she'll go below that price. Therefore, the most rational decision is to take John's guaranteed offer of $120 rather than continue negotiating."
