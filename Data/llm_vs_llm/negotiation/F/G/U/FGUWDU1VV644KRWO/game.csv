"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a perfect fit for your needs. I'm looking to sell it for $25000.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25000 is far beyond what I'm willing to pay for this product. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. My budget is limited, and I can offer you $5000 for the product. Let me know if we can make a deal.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you considering my product. However, the price you offered is significantly below what I need to sell for. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $22000?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $22000 is still far more than I can justify paying. As I mentioned, I have an offer from John for $8000, which is actually the maximum value this product has to me. I understand you need to make a profit, so I'm willing to offer you $6000 - which would give you my business instead of John. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",6000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you, and I want to make this work. I can't go that low, but I'm willing to come down further. How about $20000? This is my final offer.",20000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $20000 is still more than double what I can pay for this product. The product is only worth $8000 to me at maximum, which is exactly what John is asking. I'm trying to give you my business, but I need a price that makes financial sense for me. I can go up to $7000, which is my best offer. This is less than what John is asking, so I'd save money while you'd gain a customer. If we can't reach an agreement at this price point, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.",7000.0,Bob,6,
