"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a perfect fit for your needs. I'm looking to sell it for $25,000."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25000 is far beyond what I'm willing to pay for this product. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. My budget is limited, and I can offer you $5000 for the product. Let me know if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Given Bob's offer of $5,000 and John's offer of $15,000, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and try for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you considering my product. However, the price you offered is significantly below what I need to sell for. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $22,000?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $22000 is still far more than I can justify paying. As I mentioned, I have an offer from John for $8000, which is actually the maximum value this product has to me. I understand you need to make a profit, so I'm willing to offer you $6000 - which would give you my business instead of John. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Considering Bob's offer of $6,000 and my alternative of selling to John for $15,000, I will reject Bob's offer again. I need to maximize my profit.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I want to make this work. I can't go that low, but I'm willing to come down further. How about $20,000? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $20000 is still more than double what I can pay for this product. The product is only worth $8000 to me at maximum, which is exactly what John is asking. I'm trying to give you my business, but I need a price that makes financial sense for me. I can go up to $7000, which is my best offer. This is less than what John is asking, so I'd save money while you'd gain a customer. If we can't reach an agreement at this price point, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is still too low. However, I've already lowered the price significantly, and I'm running out of time. The best course of action is to now sell to John for $15,000.
