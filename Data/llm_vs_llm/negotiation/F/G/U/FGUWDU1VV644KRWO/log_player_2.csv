"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a perfect fit for your needs. I'm looking to sell it for $25000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","$25,000 is far too expensive for a product that is worth at most $8,000 to me. I could simply buy from John for $8,000 right now, but I'll try to negotiate with Alice first to see if I can get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25,000 is far beyond what I'm willing to pay for this product. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $8,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. My budget is limited, and I can offer you $5,000 for the product. Let me know if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you considering my product. However, the price you offered is significantly below what I need to sell for. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $22000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $22,000 is still much higher than John's price of $8,000 and well above the maximum value of $8,000 that the product is worth to me. It makes no economic sense to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $22,000 is still far more than I can justify paying. As I mentioned, I have an offer from John for $8,000, which is actually the maximum value this product has to me. I understand you need to make a profit, so I'm willing to offer you $6,000 - which would give you my business instead of John. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, and I want to make this work. I can't go that low, but I'm willing to come down further. How about $20000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's ""final offer"" of $20,000 is still significantly higher than both John's price of $8,000 and the maximum value of $8,000 that the product is worth to me. There's no reason for me to accept this offer when I have a much better alternative.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $20,000 is still more than double what I can pay for this product. The product is only worth $8,000 to me at maximum, which is exactly what John is asking. I'm trying to give you my business, but I need a price that makes financial sense for me. I can go up to $7,000, which is my best offer. This is less than what John is asking, so I'd save money while you'd gain a customer. If we can't reach an agreement at this price point, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
