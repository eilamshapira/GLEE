Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,800,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential value."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, the price is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $600000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

The reasoning is simple: Bob's offer of $600,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and since I know the product is only worth $800,000 to Bob, he will never offer more than that amount. Therefore, it's best to sell to John immediately for $1,500,000 rather than continue a negotiation that cannot reach a mutually beneficial outcome."
