"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you today. Based on my research and the product's value, I'm offering it to you for $180. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and features. Would you be interested?",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $180 is more than I can spend right now. I've done some market research, and I can find similar products for less. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget considerations. However, $120 is actually my absolute bottom line for this productâ€”it's what I can sell it to John for with no negotiation needed. Given the quality and value of this product, I can come down to $160. This is still a very competitive price for what you're getting, and it's significantly lower than my initial offer. What do you say?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price to $160. However, I know the market well, and I can get this product elsewhere for $150. That said, I value the opportunity to do business with you and would be happy to pay $135, which is above what you mentioned you could sell to John for ($120). This offer gives you a better return than your alternative, and it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",135.0,Bob,4,
