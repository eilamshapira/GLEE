"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you today. Based on my research and the product's value, I'm offering it to you for $180. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and features. Would you be interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. Alice's offer is $180, which is $30 above my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $150, which is my maximum value
4. I still have 9 rounds of negotiation available
5. Since Alice's initial offer is above my maximum value, and I have room to negotiate, I should try to get a better price

I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. It's common for initial offers to be high, and there's likely room for negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but leaves room for negotiation:

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $180 is more than I can spend right now. I've done some market research, and I can find similar products for less. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}

This counteroffer is strategic because:
1. It's polite and acknowledges Alice's offer
2. It's below my maximum of $150, giving room for negotiation upward
3. It's not too low to be considered unreasonable
4. It hints at market alternatives (like John's offer) without directly mentioning it
5. It invites further discussion"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget considerations. However, $120 is actually my absolute bottom line for this productâ€”it's what I can sell it to John for with no negotiation needed. Given the quality and value of this product, I can come down to $160. This is still a very competitive price for what you're getting, and it's significantly lower than my initial offer. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let's analyze the new situation:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $180 to $160
2. This is still above my maximum value of $150
3. Alice mentioned she can sell to John for $120 (interesting information!)
4. John's offer of $150 is still available
5. I still have 7 more potential rounds of negotiation
6. Since Alice came down $20, there might be more room for negotiation

However, a key piece of information is that Alice mentioned she can sell to John for $120. This suggests she's not being entirely truthful in the negotiation, as she earlier claimed $120 was her ""absolute bottom line"" but also says she can sell to John at that price. This makes me think there's still significant room for negotiation.

I'll reject this offer and try another counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given Alice's mention of being able to sell to John at $120 (which reveals her bottom line might be lower than claimed), and knowing that John would sell to me for $150, I'll make a strategic counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price to $160. However, I know the market well, and I can get this product elsewhere for $150. That said, I value the opportunity to do business with you and would be happy to pay $135, which is above what you mentioned you could sell to John for ($120). This offer gives you a better return than your alternative, and it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}

This counteroffer is strategic because:
1. It acknowledges her price reduction
2. It reveals my knowledge of market alternatives
3. It points out the inconsistency in her statement about John
4. The price of $135 is above her mentioned John price ($120) but below my maximum ($150)
5. It frames the offer as a win-win situation
6. It maintains a professional and cooperative tone while showing I'm well-informed"
