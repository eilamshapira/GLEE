,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a middle ground. Would you consider $70 for the product?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is far too low for this product. While I understand you have another option at $80, I can assure you of the product's quality and value. Given that I have another buyer willing to pay significantly more, the lowest I can go is $125. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer.",125.0,Alice,3,
