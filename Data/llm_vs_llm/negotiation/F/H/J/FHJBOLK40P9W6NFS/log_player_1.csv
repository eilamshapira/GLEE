"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $150. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a middle ground. Would you consider $70 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $70 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but if we can't reach a suitable agreement, I always have the option to sell to John at $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is far too low for this product. While I understand you have another option at $80, I can assure you of the product's quality and value. Given that I have another buyer willing to pay significantly more, the lowest I can go is $125. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 125}"
