"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $150. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80), it wouldn't be wise to accept this offer. While I could make a counteroffer, since John is offering exactly my maximum value, it might be strategic to use this information in negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice, mentioning John's competing offer to create some pressure for a better price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a middle ground. Would you consider $70 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is far too low for this product. While I understand you have another option at $80, I can assure you of the product's quality and value. Given that I have another buyer willing to pay significantly more, the lowest I can go is $125. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer of $125 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($80) and John's offer ($80). Since Alice only reduced the price by $25 and is still far from a reasonable price point, and we have a guaranteed option with John at $80, it's best to take John's offer rather than continue negotiating.
