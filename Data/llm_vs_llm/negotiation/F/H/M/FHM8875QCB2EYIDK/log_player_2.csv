"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,200,000. It's even higher than Alice's value of $1,500,000. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, as there's room for negotiation. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'll make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This price point is:
1. Below my maximum value ($1,200,000)
2. Gives me room to negotiate upward if needed
3. While it's below Alice's value of $1,500,000, it still represents a reasonable starting point for negotiation
4. If Alice rejects this, I can gradually increase my offer in subsequent rounds while still maintaining the option to go with John's offer of $1,200,000 as a backup"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has only reduced her price by $100,000 from her initial offer, and $1,700,000 is still well above my maximum value of $1,200,000. Since she's not showing significant movement toward a reasonable price, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. If Alice continues to maintain prices well above my maximum value, I can always exercise my option to buy from John at $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1150000}

I'll increase my previous offer by $50,000 to show willingness to negotiate while still staying below my maximum value. This counteroffer of $1,150,000:
1. Shows movement from my previous offer, demonstrating good faith negotiation
2. Remains well below my maximum threshold of $1,200,000
3. Still gives me room to negotiate further if needed
4. Maintains a reasonable gap with Alice's value of $1,500,000, suggesting potential for a mutually beneficial deal
5. Keeps John's offer of $1,200,000 as a viable backup option"
