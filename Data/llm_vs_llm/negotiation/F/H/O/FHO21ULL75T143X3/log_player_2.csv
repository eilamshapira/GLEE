"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer is $100, which is the same price as John's offer, there is no advantage in choosing one over the other. The product is worth $100 to me, so I'm indifferent between these options.
