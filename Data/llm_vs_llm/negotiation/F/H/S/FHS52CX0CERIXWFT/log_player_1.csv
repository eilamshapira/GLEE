Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer since I know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, while maintaining some room for negotiation if needed.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is better than John's $10,000 and isn't too far from my initial ask, I'll try one more counter to see if I can get a bit more.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still try to get a good value, splitting the difference between our last positions.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's new offer of $11,500 is still significantly better than John's $10,000, and the negotiation seems to be moving in smaller increments now, I'll accept this offer rather than risk losing the deal.
