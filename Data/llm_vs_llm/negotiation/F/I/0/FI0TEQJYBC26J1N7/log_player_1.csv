Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to choose a price that maximizes my expected return while considering Bob might reject too high an offer.

Since I know my product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me and I have John as a guaranteed backup buyer at that price, I should offer Bob a price higher than my minimum value to increase my profit.

Without knowing Bob's valuation, I'll set a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but not so high that it would likely be rejected outright.
