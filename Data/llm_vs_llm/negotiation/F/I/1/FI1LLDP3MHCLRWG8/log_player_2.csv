"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $10,000 is lower than the price John is offering ($12,000) and it's also below my maximum value for the product ($12,000), it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer. This allows me to save $2,000 compared to buying from John.
