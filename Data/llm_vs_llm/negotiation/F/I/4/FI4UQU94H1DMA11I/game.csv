"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1600000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring to you.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Given my research and the value I place on this product, I'd like to offer $1000000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident this is a good starting point for a successful negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $1000000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1450000. This revised price reflects my desire to reach a mutually agreeable outcome while still recognizing the inherent value of what's being offered.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1450000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this level.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a willingness to negotiate from your side, and I respect that.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to consider $1300000. I believe this offer fairly balances our respective positions and paves the way for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point. However, $1300000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to offer a final price of $1200000. This represents my absolute top offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. If this is unacceptable, I'll have to look at other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
