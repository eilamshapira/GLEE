"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $180. It's a great product and I think you'll find it very valuable. Are you interested?",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your product, but $180 is significantly above my budget. I should mention that I can get a similar product from another seller for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $80 for your product, which is a fair price considering the market alternatives. Let me know if this works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $80 is too low for me. I appreciate your interest in my product and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle for $140? This way, we both gain from the transaction. Looking forward to your response.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $140 is still above what makes sense for me. I need to be clear that the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and I have a firm offer from John to buy it at exactly $100. I'd still prefer to purchase from you, so I'm willing to offer $90, which saves me a bit compared to my alternative while giving you the sale. This is really the most I can justify spending based on my budget and the product's value to me.",90.0,Bob,4,
