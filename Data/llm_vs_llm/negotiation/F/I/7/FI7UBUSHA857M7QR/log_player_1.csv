Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your product, but $180 is significantly above my budget. I should mention that I can get a similar product from another seller for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $80 for your product, which is a fair price considering the market alternatives. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Looking forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $140 is still above what makes sense for me. I need to be clear that the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and I have a firm offer from John to buy it at exactly $100. I'd still prefer to purchase from you, so I'm willing to offer $90, which saves me a bit compared to my alternative while giving you the sale. This is really the most I can justify spending based on my budget and the product's value to me.
