"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $180. It's a great product and I think you'll find it very valuable. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $180, but I know that the product is worth no more than $100 to me. Also, I have the option to buy the same product from John for $100 at any time.

Given that:
1. Alice's offer ($180) is well above my maximum value ($100)
2. I have a guaranteed alternative to buy at $100
3. There's no reason to pay $80 more than necessary

I should mention that I can get a similar product from another seller for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $80 is too low for me. I appreciate your interest in my product and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle for $140? This way, we both gain from the transaction. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to evaluate Alice's counteroffer of $140. This is still $40 more than what I can pay to John ($100), and the product is only worth up to $100 to me. There's no reason for me to pay more than the product's value to me or more than my alternative option.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $140 is still above what makes sense for me. I need to be clear that the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and I have a firm offer from John to buy it at exactly $100. I'd still prefer to purchase from you, so I'm willing to offer $90, which saves me a bit compared to my alternative while giving you the sale. This is really the most I can justify spending based on my budget and the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 90}"
