"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $18000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $14000 for it. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counter, Bob. I appreciate you considering the value. While $14000 is lower than I'm aiming for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $16500?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $16500 is closer, but still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  I'll offer $15500 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. $15500 is a good step. However, I'm pretty firm on the value I'm offering. Let's meet closer to the middle, at $16200. This is my best offer for now.",16200.0,Alice,5,
