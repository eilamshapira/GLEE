"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is lower than the minimum value of $12,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $12,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I am willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer is $18,000. 

Please let me know Bob's response.
