Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I certainly understand Bob's perspective, but the product's value to me is significantly higher than Bob's offer. How about we settle for $900,000? This way, both parties can benefit from the transaction."

I appreciate Bob's efforts to find a suitable price point. However, given the product's value to me and the alternative offer from John, it makes the most financial sense for me to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. Thank you, Bob, for your time and consideration."
