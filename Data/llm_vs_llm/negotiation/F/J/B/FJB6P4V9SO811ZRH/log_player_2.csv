"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to analyze this offer carefully.

The product is worth at most $800,000 to me, and Alice is offering to sell it for $1,000,000. This means if I accept Alice's offer, I would be paying $200,000 more than the product's value to me.

I also have an alternative option - I can buy the same product from John for $800,000, which exactly matches the maximum I'm willing to pay.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, the logical choice is to buy from John instead of accepting Alice's higher-priced offer.
