"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this product for $140. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'll analyze the situation:
1. Alice is offering the product for $140
2. The product is worth $120 to me
3. John is willing to sell it for $120
4. Alice's offer ($140) is above both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120)

Since Alice's offer is higher than both my maximum value and John's price, there's no reason to accept it or continue negotiating. The best decision is to buy from John.
