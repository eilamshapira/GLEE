"Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for sale. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to start the negotiations at $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $175 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I have other options available at much lower prices. I would be willing to pay $65 for it. This is a fair price that would work for me.",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product is truly valuable and I'm confident it can benefit you. How about we meet in the middle at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $120 is still more than I can justify spending. I need to be direct: I have another seller offering the same product for $80. To make it worth buying from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer $70, which would be a fair deal for both of us.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While that other offer is tempting, I truly believe my product is of higher quality and will benefit you more in the long run. I'm willing to come down to $95, my final offer. This is a significant discount and a fair price considering the value you're getting.",95.0,Alice,5,
