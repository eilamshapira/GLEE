"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for sale. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to start the negotiations at $175. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and John is willing to sell it for $80, there's no way I would accept Alice's offer of $175. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to negotiate a better price. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $175 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I have other options available at much lower prices. I would be willing to pay $65 for it. This is a fair price that would work for me."", ""product_price"": 65}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product is truly valuable and I'm confident it can benefit you. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $120 is still well above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). While Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, it's still not good enough. I'll reject and make another counteroffer. If Alice won't come down to a reasonable price, I can still buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $120 is still more than I can justify spending. I need to be direct: I have another seller offering the same product for $80. To make it worth buying from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer $70, which would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While that other offer is tempting, I truly believe my product is of higher quality and will benefit you more in the long run. I'm willing to come down to $95, my final offer. This is a significant discount and a fair price considering the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

While Alice has been negotiating in good faith and has come down significantly from her initial price, her ""final offer"" of $95 is still above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). Since Alice has indicated this is her final offer and it's still not acceptable to me, it's time to end the negotiation and buy from John. There's no point in continuing the negotiation when I have a guaranteed option at $80, which is my maximum value for the product."
