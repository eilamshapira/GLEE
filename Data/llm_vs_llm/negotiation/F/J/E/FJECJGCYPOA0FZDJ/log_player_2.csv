"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering a product that I know will be of great value to you. I'm willing to sell it for $1200000. This is a steal considering the benefits it will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $1,200,000 compared to my alternatives.

The product is worth up to $1,500,000 to me, and I know that:
- Alice's offering price is $1,200,000
- Alice's cost is $800,000
- My alternative is buying from John at $1,500,000

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is $300,000 less than my maximum value and my alternative option with John. This saves me a significant amount of money while still getting the product I need.
