"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable for your business. Based on market research and the product's unique qualities, I'm offering it to you for $950000. This is a competitive price for an item that will provide significant value to your operation. I'm open to discussing the terms to find an arrangement that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I was hoping to negotiate a better price. How about $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $900000. I appreciate your interest in the product. While that's a step in the right direction, I need to get closer to the product's true market value. I can come down to $930000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's quality and the value it will bring to your business. Let me know your thoughts on this revised price.",930000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your revised offer of $930000, Alice. However, I'm still looking for a better deal. Would you consider $875000 for the product?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I notice we're moving in opposite directions with our offers. While I came down $20000 in my last offer, you've actually reduced your initial offer by $25000. This makes me concerned about the direction of our negotiation. I value your interest, but I need to be clear that my minimum acceptable price is quite a bit higher than where we're heading. I can offer $915000, which represents a significant discount from my initial price and is much closer to your first offer. This price reflects both the product's value to you and my need to achieve a reasonable return. I hope we can find common ground here.",915000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your patience, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still aiming to secure a better deal. Would you be willing to consider $850000 for the product?",850000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm noticing a concerning pattern in our negotiation. While I've been making meaningful concessions from my initial price, your offers have consistently decreased rather than meeting me somewhere in the middle. The product is worth significantly more than $850000, and frankly, I have another buyer ready to purchase it at $800000. At this point, I need to be direct: my absolute lowest price is $895000. This represents a substantial $55000 discount from my initial offer and is very close to your first offer of $900000, which I thought was a reasonable starting point. If we can't reach an agreement near this price, I'll need to pursue other options. I value the potential of doing business with you, but need a fair price for this valuable product.",895000.0,Alice,7,
