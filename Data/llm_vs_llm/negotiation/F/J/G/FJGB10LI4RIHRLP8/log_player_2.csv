Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $900000. I appreciate your interest in the product. While that's a step in the right direction, I need to get closer to the product's true market value. I can come down to $930000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's quality and the value it will bring to your business.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I notice we're moving in opposite directions with our offers. While I came down $20000 in my last offer, you've actually reduced your initial offer by $25000. This makes me concerned about the direction of our negotiation. I value your interest, but I need to be clear that my minimum acceptable price is quite a bit higher than where we're heading. I can offer $915000, which represents a significant discount from my initial price and is much closer to your first offer. This price reflects both the product's value to you and my need to achieve a reasonable return. I hope we can find common ground here.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm noticing a concerning pattern in our negotiation. While I've been making meaningful concessions from my initial price, your offers have consistently decreased rather than meeting me somewhere in the middle. The product is worth significantly more than $850000, and frankly, I have another buyer ready to purchase it at $800000. At this point, I need to be direct: my absolute lowest price is $895000. This represents a substantial $55000 discount from my initial offer and is very close to your first offer of $900000, which I thought was a reasonable starting point. If we can't reach an agreement near this price, I'll need to pursue other options. I value the potential of doing business with you, but need a fair price for this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $895,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $895,000
