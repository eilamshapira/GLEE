"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: Alice's offer of $22,000 is way above my maximum value of $8,000. It would be unwise to accept this offer when I can either get a better deal through negotiation or buy from John for $8,000. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 6000}

Rationale: I'll start with a low offer of $6,000 which:
1. Is below my maximum value of $8,000
2. Leaves room for negotiation to move up
3. Is still above Alice's cost of $5,000, so there's potential for both parties to benefit
4. Even if Alice rejects this, it sets an anchor point for further negotiations
5. I always have the backup option of buying from John at $8,000 if negotiations don't work out"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: Alice has lowered her price from $22,000 to $18,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but $18,000 is still more than twice my maximum value of $8,000. Since I can get the product from John for $8,000, there's no reason to accept an offer that's significantly higher than that. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, but if Alice doesn't come down to a reasonable price soon, I'll consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 7000}

Rationale: I'll increase my offer from $6,000 to $7,000 to show I'm willing to negotiate in good faith. This price:
1. Is still below my maximum value of $8,000
2. Is higher than my previous offer, showing willingness to compromise
3. Leaves me room to still make a small profit
4. If Alice continues to demand much higher prices, I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000
5. Shows Alice that I'm not going to make dramatic jumps in price, as my target range is firmly below $8,000"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Rationale: While Alice has continued to lower her price (from $22,000 to $18,000 to $15,000), she's still asking for nearly double my maximum value of $8,000. Given that:
1. Alice's current offer is still significantly above my maximum value
2. The rate at which she's lowering her price suggests we won't reach an acceptable price within the remaining rounds
3. I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $8,000
4. We're already halfway through our negotiation rounds

It's most rational to take John's offer of $8,000 now. This ensures I get the product at my maximum acceptable price rather than risking further rounds of negotiation that may not reach an acceptable conclusion."
