"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredibly valuable item. Given its unique qualities and potential benefits for you, I'm initially pricing it at $1800000. I believe this reflects its true worth. Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1800000 is significantly above my budget. I'm looking for a much more reasonable price, considering market conditions. I would be willing to pay $600000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's find a middle ground. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? I'm willing to lower the price to $1650000. I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving down in price, Alice, but $1650000 is still well above what I can justify spending. Given my budget constraints and market research, I can increase my offer to $700000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and represents the realistic value I see in this product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's try to close this deal. I'm willing to go down to $1450000. This is a significant reduction from my original price and a testament to my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price. What do you say?",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate and the significant reduction you've made. However, there's still a considerable gap between our positions. I can move up to $775000, which is very close to my absolute maximum budget. This represents another substantial increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious intent to close this deal.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, this is my best offer so far. I am willing to go down to $1200000. I am close to my final offer. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
