Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredibly valuable item.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1800000 is significantly above my budget. I'm looking for a much more reasonable price, considering market conditions. I would be willing to pay $600000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you moving down in price, Alice, but $1650000 is still well above what I can justify spending. Given my budget constraints and market research, I can increase my offer to $700000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and represents the realistic value I see in this product.
