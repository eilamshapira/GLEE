"Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand $200 might seem steep, and while $50 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $150?",150.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $75 is still quite low for what I'm willing to part with it for. How about we split the difference again and settle at $115?",115.0,Alice,5,
