Let's see if Alice is willing to lower her price. I'm interested in the product but $200 is too high for me."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand $200 might seem steep, and while $50 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $150?

Alice is coming down on her price, but $150 is still too high for me. I'll see if she's willing to go lower.

Alice's price is still too high for me, and John is offering a better deal. I'll buy the product from John for $100."
