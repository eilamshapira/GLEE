"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product and I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a high offer. 

{""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,500,000, I will not accept Bob's offer.

However, I still want to explore the possibility of getting a better deal from Bob, so I won't sell to John just yet.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $500,000, which is very low, I'll make a counteroffer that is still high, but slightly lower than my initial offer, to show that I'm willing to negotiate.

{""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $700,000 is still lower than the minimum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me. While it's an increase from his previous offer, it's not enough to make it an attractive option.

I'll reject Bob's offer again and try to make another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer increased to $700,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous one, to show that I'm willing to continue negotiating.

{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $750,000 is still significantly lower than the minimum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me. At this point, I'm not seeing a lot of movement from Bob towards a price that I'm comfortable with.

Given that I have a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from John, I'm starting to think that it may be better to just sell to him rather than continuing to negotiate with Bob.

However, I'll give Bob one more chance to come up with a more reasonable offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer is still far from my target price, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous one, but still much higher than Bob's offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.

{""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $750,000 is the same as his previous offer, which indicates that he's not willing to budge much. My counteroffer in Round 7 was $1,750,000, which is still much higher than Bob's offer.

At this point, I think it's clear that Bob is not going to meet me at a price that I'm comfortable with. I have a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from John, which is still on the table.

I don't see any reason to continue negotiating with Bob, as it's unlikely that he'll come up with a better offer in the next two rounds.
