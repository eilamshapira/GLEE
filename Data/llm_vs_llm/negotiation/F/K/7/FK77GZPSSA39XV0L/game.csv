"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1900000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $700000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your initial offer. However, considering the product's exceptional value and my minimum acceptable price, I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down somewhat, but I need to be compensated fairly. How about $1800000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $1800000 is still far too high for me. While I recognize the product has value, my maximum budget is significantly less. I can offer $800000. This is my best offer at this point.",800000.0,Bob,4,
