"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique value and the limited availability, I'm offering it to you for $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1900000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $700000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Considering Bob's offer of $700,000, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and knowing I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your initial offer. However, considering the product's exceptional value and my minimum acceptable price, I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down somewhat, but I need to be compensated fairly. How about $1,800,000?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1800000 is still far too high for me. While I recognize the product has value, my maximum budget is significantly less. I can offer $800000. This is my best offer at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer of $800,000 is still below my minimum of $1,000,000, and at this point, I'm starting to feel like Bob is lowballing me. Considering I have John's guaranteed offer, I'm going to cut my losses and accept that more certain profit.
