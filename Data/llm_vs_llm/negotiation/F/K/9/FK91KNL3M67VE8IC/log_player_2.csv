You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","**{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**

Let's try to negotiate and see if we can get a better price.

**Counteroffer:**
Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking for a better deal. Would you consider selling it for $10,000?"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","**{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking for a better deal. Would you consider selling it for $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}**
