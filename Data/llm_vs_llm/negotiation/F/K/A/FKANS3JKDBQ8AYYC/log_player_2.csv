"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $950,000 is very close to that, I'll consider the options. However, I'd like to try to save some money, so I'll reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I'll try to meet her halfway between her worth and my maximum budget.

My counteroffer is: {""product_price"": 850000}"

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but it's getting closer to a reasonable price. Since I know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I'll try to make another counteroffer that's closer to that value.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer that's lower than Alice's last offer, but still a bit higher than my previous offer. I'll try to split the difference between Alice's last offer and my previous counteroffer.
