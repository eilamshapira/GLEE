"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given the information:
- The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me (Bob)
- Alice is offering the product for $20,000
- John is willing to sell the same product for $8,000

The logical choice is to buy from John since:
1. Alice's price ($20,000) is much higher than the product's worth to me
2. John's price ($8,000) matches the maximum value I place on the product
