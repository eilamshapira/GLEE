Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a better price. Let me think for a moment... How about we meet in the middle between my original offer and your counteroffer?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I still need to get a bit more for the product. How about we meet at $90 is too low I will do $95 and that is as low as I can go?

While Alice is getting closer to my price range, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  John offers a guaranteed price of $100, which is close enough to Alice's current offer."
