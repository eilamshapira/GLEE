"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic offer for you! I'm selling a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm offering it to you for $14000. This is a great deal considering the benefits it will provide you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to consider the options carefully:

1. Alice's offer: $14,000
2. John's offer: $15,000
3. The product is worth up to $15,000 to me

Alice's offer is $1,000 cheaper than John's offer, and it's within my valuation limit. While Alice is likely making a good profit (since it's worth $8,000 to her), I would still save $1,000 compared to buying from John.
