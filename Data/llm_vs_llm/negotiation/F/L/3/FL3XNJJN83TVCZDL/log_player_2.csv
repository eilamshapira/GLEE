"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'm offering you first before selling it elsewhere. Based on its quality and value, I'm pricing it at $25000. This is a premium product that I believe would be highly beneficial for you. If you're interested, please let me know. If not, I understand and already have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $25,000
3. John is willing to sell it for $10,000

Alice's offer ($25,000) is significantly higher than both:
- The maximum value I place on the product ($10,000)
- John's alternative offer ($10,000)

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer since:
1. It's 2.5 times more expensive than what I value it at
2. I have a guaranteed option to buy it from John at $10,000
3. Accepting Alice's offer would mean losing $15,000 compared to John's offer

The logical choice is to buy from John.
