"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle at $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. This is my highest offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
