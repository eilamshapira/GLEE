Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'm offering. I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. Are you interested?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $8,000, which is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, I will reject it and try to negotiate a better price.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle at $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. This is my highest offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it's getting closer. Since he says it's his highest offer, I need to decide if I want to try and get more from him or cut my losses and sell to John.

I'll reject and try to make a final counteroffer, but I'll keep the option to sell to John in mind.
