"Hello Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested!",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to let you know that I can get the same product from another seller for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a more competitive price. I'm willing to offer $80 for the product. This would save me some money compared to my alternative option, while still giving you a sale. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $80 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need at least $120 to make this worthwhile. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $135? This price still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, I need to be clear that I can purchase this product from John for exactly $100, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay for it. I'd still prefer to buy from you, so I'm offering $90. This gives you a sale today and saves me a bit compared to my alternative. If we can't agree on a price below $100, I'll unfortunately need to go with the other seller.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and $90 is closer than before. However, it's still below what I need to make this sale. I can't go lower than $105. This price is still a good deal for you, as it's less than what you'd pay elsewhere, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,5,
