Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to let you know that I can get the same product from another seller for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a more competitive price. I'm willing to offer $80 for the product. This would save me some money compared to my alternative option, while still giving you a sale. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $80 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need at least $120 to make this worthwhile. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $135? This price still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale."", ""product_price"": 135}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, I need to be clear that I can purchase this product from John for exactly $100, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay for it. I'd still prefer to buy from you, so I'm offering $90. This gives you a sale today and saves me a bit compared to my alternative. If we can't agree on a price below $100, I'll unfortunately need to go with the other seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and $90 is closer than before. However, it's still below what I need to make this sale. I can't go lower than $105. This price is still a good deal for you, as it's less than what you'd pay elsewhere, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
