# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is offering the product for the maximum price you'd be willing to pay. There's no benefit to accepting this offer immediately. By rejecting, we might be able to negotiate a lower price or confidently buy it from John for the same amount."
