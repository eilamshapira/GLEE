"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","In this situation, I need to consider the value of the product to me ($1,200,000) and the current offer from Alice ($1,000,000).

Alice's offer is $1,000,000, which is $200,000 less than my maximum valuation of the product. This is also $200,000 above Alice's valuation of $800,000, so there might be room for negotiation to get an even better price.

I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. There's no reason to buy from John at $1,200,000 when Alice is already offering a better price, and I might be able to negotiate an even better deal with Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's above Alice's valuation but gives me more savings compared to Alice's initial offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her price from $1,000,000 to $950,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This new price is $250,000 below my maximum valuation, which is a good savings. However, since Alice's valuation is $800,000, there might still be room to negotiate a better price.

I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating, as Alice has already shown willingness to come down in price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has now reduced her price to $900,000, which is $300,000 below my maximum valuation. She's moved $100,000 from her initial offer of $1,000,000, and the current price is only $100,000 above her valuation of $800,000.

Since Alice has continued to drop her price and we're getting closer to a middle ground between our valuations, I'll accept this offer. The savings of $300,000 compared to buying from John is substantial, and there's a risk that continuing to negotiate might frustrate Alice.
