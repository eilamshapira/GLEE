,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $5000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $5000 is significantly below its value.  I could come down to $17000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $17000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $7000. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's try to find a middle ground here. I'm willing to lower the price to $14000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product.  I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $8000. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm making a final offer at $12000. This is the lowest I can go and still reflect the value of this product.  This is a great opportunity for you.",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $12000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000. This is my best and final offer. If we can agree on this, I think it would be a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,8,
