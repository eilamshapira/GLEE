"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is quite tight. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it. Let me know if we can work something out.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, the product's value to us is significantly higher than $1200000. I'm willing to come down to $1800000, considering our ongoing relationship. Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"Thank you for considering a lower price, Alice. I really want to make this deal work. Could we agree on $1400000? I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $1400000 is still below our minimum threshold. I'm prepared to go as low as $1600000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you.",1600000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. Given the product's value and our previous discussions, I'm willing to lower the price to $1550000. This is a significant concession on our part, and I hope it aligns more closely with your budget. What are your thoughts?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
