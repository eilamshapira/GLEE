Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my options carefully. I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, and I can always sell it to John for exactly that amount. Bob values the product at $8,000, which means he won't pay more than that.

Since I already have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 (John), there's no reason for me to sell to Bob for less than that amount. However, I could try offering Bob a price close to his valuation to see if he accepts.

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, but given the circumstances, I should be prepared to sell to John if Bob doesn't come close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
