Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think of my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to pay $80 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $80 is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I also have the option to sell it to John for the same price, I don't see a benefit in accepting Bob's offer immediately without trying to negotiate a better price. However, selling to John or accepting Bob's offer achieves my minimum requirement. Given that I have the potential to earn more by negotiating, but Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, the strategic decision would be to try and negotiate further to see if I can get a better offer from Bob, but since his offer matches the minimum I'd accept from John, and I don't have information that suggests Bob would pay more, the safest choice to ensure I meet my goal of earning at least $80 is to accept his offer.
