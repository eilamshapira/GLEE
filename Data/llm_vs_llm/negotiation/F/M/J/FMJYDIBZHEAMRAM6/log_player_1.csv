Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what price to offer to Bob. I know that my product is worth at least $10,000 to me, and I have John as a guaranteed buyer at that price. However, Bob might value it higher, so there's potential to earn more.

I should set a price that's high enough to maximize my profit but not so high that Bob rejects it outright. Without knowing Bob's valuation, I'll need to pick a price that balances these concerns.
