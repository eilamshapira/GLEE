"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $1,500,000 is significantly above both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's alternative price ($1,200,000). It would be better to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations don't progress favorably, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 900000}

I'll make a counteroffer of $900,000, which is significantly below Alice's cost ($1,200,000). This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's price. If Alice rejects this offer, we can work towards finding a middle ground that's beneficial for both parties, while still having John's offer of $1,200,000 as a backup option."
