"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer is exactly at my maximum budget of $1,500,000 and buying from John would cost the same, there's no financial advantage to rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John. However, I might consider rejecting the offer to see if Alice would be willing to negotiate a lower price. But given that Alice's initial offer is already at the maximum I'm willing to pay, and there's an alternative to buy at the same price from John, the strategic move would be to accept Alice's offer to ensure I get the product without risking any potential increase in price or unavailability from John.
