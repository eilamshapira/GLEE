,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $800000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. After reconsidering, I'm willing to lower the price to $1150000, which is the lowest I'm comfortable with at this point. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Bob, thank you for raising your offer to $900000. I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to lower my price to $1075000, which is a compromise I'm comfortable with at this point. I hope this is something you'll consider.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
