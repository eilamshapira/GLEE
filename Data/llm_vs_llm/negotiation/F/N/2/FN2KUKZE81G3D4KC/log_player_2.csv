Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, $2,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $500,000 as a starting point for further negotiation."",
""product_price"": 500000
}
```

""product_price"": 750000
}
