"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Based on the information provided, I need to compare my options:

1. Accept Alice's offer to buy the product for $14,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy the product from John for $8,000

The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $8,000. Alice's offer of $14,000 is significantly higher than both the product's value to me and John's price.

The most economical choice is clearly to buy from John for $8,000.
