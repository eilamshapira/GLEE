"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $20000.  What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $6000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $17000. I believe this price better reflects the true value and potential this product holds for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  I can go up to $7000, but that's really my limit. If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm seeing a gap between what I need to make this work and your offer.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  My final offer to you is $14000.  This is my absolute bottom line to make this deal happen with you.",14000.0,Alice,5,
