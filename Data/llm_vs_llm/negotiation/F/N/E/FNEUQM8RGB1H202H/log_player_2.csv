Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm seeing a gap between what I need to make this work and your offer.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  My final offer to you is $14000.  This is my absolute bottom line to make this deal happen with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

While Alice is coming down, the price is still significantly higher than my $8,000 maximum. Her mentioning another buyer at a higher price point could be a negotiating tactic, and further haggling might not yield a satisfactory result. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
