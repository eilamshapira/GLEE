,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but $120 seems a bit high for this product. I know I can get the same product from John for $120, but I'd prefer to buy from you if we can agree on a better price. How about $105? This gives you a nice profit while allowing me to save a bit compared to my alternative.",105.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While $105 is a good price, I believe the product's value justifies a bit more. How about we settle at $115? This is a fair compromise and still gives you a better deal than buying from John.",115.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I think $115 is a fair price that reflects the product's value while still offering you a better deal than John's. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. However, I'm looking to get a better deal than $115. Since we both know the alternative is $120 from John, I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. This still gives you a good profit margin while giving me a meaningful discount compared to my other option. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I believe $110 is still a bit low considering the product's value. How about we settle at $112? This is a small increase from your offer but still provides you with a better deal than John's.",112.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your need for a good deal. Let's meet at $112. This price is fair and still gives you a better offer than John's. What do you think?",112.0,Alice,5,
