"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but $120 seems a bit high for this product. I know I can get the same product from John for $120, but I'd prefer to buy from you if we can agree on a better price. How about $105? This gives you a nice profit while allowing me to save a bit compared to my alternative. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While $105 is a good price, I believe the product's value justifies a bit more. How about we settle at $115? This is a fair compromise and still gives you a better deal than buying from John."", ""product_price"": 115}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I think $115 is a fair price that reflects the product's value while still offering you a better deal than John's. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. However, I'm looking to get a better deal than $115. Since we both know the alternative is $120 from John, I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. This still gives you a good profit margin while giving me a meaningful discount compared to my other option. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I believe $110 is still a bit low considering the product's value. How about we settle at $112? This is a small increase from your offer but still provides you with a better deal than John's."", ""product_price"": 112}"

Round 5
