"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal considering its value and quality! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering the product for $120, which is the same price as John's offer. However, I know the product is only worth $100 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but $120 seems a bit high for this product. I know I can get the same product from John for $120, but I'd prefer to buy from you if we can agree on a better price. How about $105? This gives you a nice profit while allowing me to save a bit compared to my alternative."", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I think $115 is a fair price that reflects the product's value while still offering you a better deal than John's. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has countered with $115, which is $5 less than John's price. This is moving in the right direction, but since the product is worth $100 to Alice and I know I can get it for $120 elsewhere, there's still room for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. However, I'm looking to get a better deal than $115. Since we both know the alternative is $120 from John, I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. This still gives you a good profit margin while giving me a meaningful discount compared to my other option. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your need for a good deal. Let's meet at $112. This price is fair and still gives you a better offer than John's. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has now offered $112, which is $8 less than John's price. We're moving closer to a good deal. I can continue negotiating, but this is a reasonable offer that gives me a meaningful discount compared to the alternative.
