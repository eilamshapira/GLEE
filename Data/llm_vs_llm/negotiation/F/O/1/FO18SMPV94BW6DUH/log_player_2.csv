"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a great product I think you'd really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for a special price of $110. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is a better price than $120, you can still do better. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can hopefully negotiate a lower price with her or buy from another seller at a better price."
