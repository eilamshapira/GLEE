,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that $180 might be a bit high, but I'm afraid $80 is too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $150. I'd appreciate it if you could reconsider and meet me somewhere in the middle.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $150 is still a bit high for my budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $115?  This feels like a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your patience. I understand that we're trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is quite close to my reserve price, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this point.",130.0,Alice,5,
