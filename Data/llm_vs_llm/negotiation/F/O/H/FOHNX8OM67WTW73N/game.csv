"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. Considering the product's worth to me, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I need to be transparent that $900000 is significantly below what this product is worth. My minimum acceptable price is $1500000, which represents the current market value and what I've been offered elsewhere. I'm willing to work with you because I believe you could benefit from this product, but I cannot go below this threshold as it would represent a loss for me.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your transparency regarding the product's value. However, I still need to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your minimum acceptable price and my budget, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. This is the highest I'm willing to go at this point, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. I appreciate your willingness to find middle ground. However, I must be clear that I cannot sell below $1500000 as this is the absolute minimum value of the product to me. I already have an offer from another buyer at this price point. If we cannot reach an agreement at $1500000, I will unfortunately need to pursue that alternative option. I hope you can understand my position.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
