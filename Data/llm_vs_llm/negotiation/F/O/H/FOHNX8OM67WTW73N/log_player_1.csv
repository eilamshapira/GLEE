Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. Considering the product's worth to me, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I need to be transparent that $900,000 is significantly below what this product is worth. My minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000, which represents the current market value and what I've been offered elsewhere. I'm willing to work with you because I believe you could benefit from this product, but I cannot go below this threshold as it would represent a loss for me."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"

Considering your minimum acceptable price and my budget, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. This is the highest I'm willing to go at this point, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. I appreciate your willingness to find middle ground. However, I must be clear that I cannot sell below $1,500,000 as this is the absolute minimum value of the product to me. I already have an offer from another buyer at this price point. If we cannot reach an agreement at $1,500,000, I will unfortunately need to pursue that alternative option. I hope you can understand my position."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
