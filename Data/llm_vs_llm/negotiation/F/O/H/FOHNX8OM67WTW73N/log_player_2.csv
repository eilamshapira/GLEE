Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I need to be transparent that $900000 is significantly below what this product is worth. My minimum acceptable price is $1500000, which represents the current market value and what I've been offered elsewhere. I'm willing to work with you because I believe you could benefit from this product, but I cannot go below this threshold as it would represent a loss for me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. I appreciate your willingness to find middle ground. However, I must be clear that I cannot sell below $1500000 as this is the absolute minimum value of the product to me. I already have an offer from another buyer at this price point. If we cannot reach an agreement at $1500000, I will unfortunately need to pursue that alternative option. I hope you can understand my position.
