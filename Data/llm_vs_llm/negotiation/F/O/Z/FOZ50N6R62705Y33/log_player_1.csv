"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $8,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 (what John is offering), but I'll continue negotiating with Bob since we still have several rounds left.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let me make a counteroffer: {""product_price"": 16000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $9,000 is still well below John's guaranteed offer of $12,000, and Bob's small increase from $8,000 to $9,000 suggests he might not be willing to go much higher. However, I'll try one more negotiation round before considering selling to John.

Let me make a counteroffer: {""product_price"": 14500}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $12,000. While Bob has shown significant movement in his offers (from $8,000 to $9,000 to $11,000), accepting less than what John is offering wouldn't be rational. Given that we're already in round 6 and Bob is still below John's price, I'll choose to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $12,000.
