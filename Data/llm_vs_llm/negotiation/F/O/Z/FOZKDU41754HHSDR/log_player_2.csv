"Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think through this:

1. Alice is offering the product for $130
2. My maximum value for the product is $150
3. John is willing to sell it for $150 (my worst-case option)
4. The product is worth $100 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation

Since Alice's offer ($130) is below my maximum value ($150) and better than John's price ($150), I could accept it. However, since I know the product is worth $100 to Alice, I can try to negotiate for a better price. Rejecting and making a counteroffer seems like the best strategy here, as I have nothing to lose - I can always buy from John later if negotiations fail.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $100 to Alice and she offered $130, I'll make a counteroffer that's above her cost but below her initial offer. I'll propose $110, which gives her a reasonable $10 profit while saving me money. This leaves room for further negotiation if she rejects.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","This is a good development! Alice has dropped her price from $130 to $120, showing she's willing to negotiate. This new price is:
- $30 less than John's price ($150)
- Only $20 above Alice's cost ($100)
- A fair middle ground between my previous offer ($110) and her original offer ($130)

Given that:
1. We've already seen Alice is willing to negotiate downward
2. The current offer is quite reasonable
3. There's a risk of Alice raising the price if negotiations continue
4. $120 represents a good savings compared to John's price

I'll accept this offer.
