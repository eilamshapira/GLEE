Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're offering, I need to be transparent that your asking price of $2000000 is significantly above my maximum budget. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for exactly that amount. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a fair price. I can offer you $700000 for the product, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still providing you with a sale. Let me know if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

My reasoning is that Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my initial asking price and also lower than what John is willing to pay me ($1,200,000). I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'd like to try to get a better price from Bob before considering other options. In the next round, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your transparency about your budget and the other offer you have on the table. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must say that $700,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I'd like to meet you halfway between your offer and my initial asking price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,500,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, but I need to emphasize that $1500000 still exceeds my maximum budget. As I mentioned, the product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, which is exactly what John is offering. While I'd prefer to purchase from you, I can't justify paying more than the product's value to me. I can offer you $850000, which gives you a better deal than my previous offer while still being financially sensible for me. This represents a significant savings compared to John's price, and I hope we can close the deal at this level. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

My reasoning is that Bob's offer of $850,000 is still lower than what John is willing to pay me ($1,200,000). While Bob is trying to negotiate in good faith, I believe I can try to get a better price from him. Since Bob has mentioned that the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to him, I'll try to get closer to that value in my next counteroffer. In the next round, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence in trying to find a mutually agreeable price. I understand that $1,500,000 was still too high for you, and I'm willing to come down further. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This price is closer to your valuation and still gives me a better deal than selling it to John. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for continuing to work with me on finding a price that works for both of us. I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation, but I still need to be practical about this purchase. Since John is offering the exact same product at $1000000, which is precisely my maximum valuation, I can't justify paying $1100000. However, I'm willing to offer you $950000, which is very close to my maximum budget and John's price. This represents a $50000 savings for me compared to John's offer, while still giving you a better deal than you might get elsewhere. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price point, as I'd genuinely prefer to do business with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

My reasoning is that Bob's offer of $950,000 is still lower than what John is willing to pay me ($1,200,000). While Bob is trying to negotiate in good faith and is getting closer to his maximum valuation, I believe I can try to get an even better price from him or at least meet him at his maximum valuation of $1,000,000. Since we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, I'll try to make a more aggressive counteroffer to see if Bob is willing to meet me at a higher price. In the next round, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob."

I understand that you're trying to be practical about this purchase, and I respect that.

I'm willing to meet you at your maximum valuation of $1,000,000, which is a compromise for both of us. This way, you'll get the product at a price that's fair to you, and I'll get a better deal than selling it to someone else.
