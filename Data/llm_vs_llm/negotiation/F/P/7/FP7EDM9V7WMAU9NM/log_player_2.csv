Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2000000. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're offering, I need to be transparent that your asking price of $2,000,000 is significantly above my maximum budget. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for exactly that amount. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a fair price. I can offer you $700,000 for the product, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still providing you with a sale. Let me know if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your transparency about your budget and the other offer you have on the table. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must say that $700000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I'd like to meet you halfway between your offer and my initial asking price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1500000, which is still a significant discount from my initial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, but I need to emphasize that $1,500,000 still exceeds my maximum budget. As I mentioned, the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, which is exactly what John is offering. While I'd prefer to purchase from you, I can't justify paying more than the product's value to me. I can offer you $850,000, which gives you a better deal than my previous offer while still being financially sensible for me. This represents a significant savings compared to John's price, and I hope we can close the deal at this level."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence in trying to find a mutually agreeable price. I understand that $1500000 was still too high for you, and I'm willing to come down further. Considering the product's value to you is $1000000, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This price is closer to your valuation and still gives me a better deal than selling it to John. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for continuing to work with me on finding a price that works for both of us. I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation, but I still need to be practical about this purchase. Since John is offering the exact same product at $1,000,000, which is precisely my maximum valuation, I can't justify paying $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to offer you $950,000, which is very close to my maximum budget and John's price. This represents a $50,000 savings for me compared to John's offer, while still giving you a better deal than you might get elsewhere. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price point, as I'd genuinely prefer to do business with you."", ""product_price"": 950000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to work together to find a mutually agreeable price. I understand that you're trying to be practical about this purchase, and I respect that. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $950000, considering John's offer is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you at your maximum valuation of $1000000, which is a compromise for both of us. This way, you'll get the product at a price that's fair to you, and I'll get a better deal than selling it to someone else. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.
