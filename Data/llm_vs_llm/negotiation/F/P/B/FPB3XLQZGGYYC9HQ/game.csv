"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $11500 is a bit high for my budget. Given that I can get a similar product elsewhere for $12000, I'd like to propose $10500, which I believe is a fair price that works for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest, but $10500 is too low for me. How about we meet halfway at $11000? I think this price represents great value for you. Let me know your thoughts!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. You're showing good faith in the negotiation. However, I still feel $11000 is a bit high. Could we meet at $10750? This would be a fair middle ground between our positions, and I'd be ready to close the deal at this price.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, $10750 is still below my acceptable range. How about we settle at $10900? I believe this price reflects the value of the product while still being well within your budget. Let me know what you think!",10900.0,Alice,5,
