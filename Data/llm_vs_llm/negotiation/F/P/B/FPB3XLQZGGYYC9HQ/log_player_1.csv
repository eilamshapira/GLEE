Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $11500 is a bit high for my budget. Given that I can get a similar product elsewhere for $12000, I'd like to propose $10500, which I believe is a fair price that works for both of us. What do you think?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. You're showing good faith in the negotiation. However, I still feel $11000 is a bit high. Could we meet at $10750? This would be a fair middle ground between our positions, and I'd be ready to close the deal at this price.
