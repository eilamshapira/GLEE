"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it for $11500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so she has room to negotiate down
2. John's price of $12,000 is my worst-case scenario
3. Alice's initial offer of $11,500 is quite high, only $500 less than John's price
4. With 10 rounds available, I have room to negotiate for a better price

Since Alice's initial offer is only slightly better than John's price, and I have plenty of negotiation rounds left, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably lower but not insulting:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $11,500 is a bit high for my budget. Given that I can get a similar product elsewhere for $12,000, I'd like to propose $10,500, which I believe is a fair price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest, but $10500 is too low for me. How about we meet halfway at $11000? I think this price represents great value for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this new offer:

1. Alice has come down $500 from her initial offer of $11,500 to $11,000
2. This is $1,000 less than John's price of $12,000
3. The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so she still has room to negotiate
4. We still have several rounds left for negotiation
5. Her movement from $11,500 to $11,000 shows she's willing to negotiate

While $11,000 is better, I think there's still room for a better price. Since we have plenty of rounds left and Alice has shown willingness to negotiate, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. You're showing good faith in the negotiation. However, I still feel $11,000 is a bit high. Could we meet at $10,750? This would be a fair middle ground between our positions, and I'd be ready to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 10750}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, $10750 is still below my acceptable range. How about we settle at $10900? I believe this price reflects the value of the product while still being well within your budget. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let's analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has moved down again from $11,000 to $10,900
2. This is now $1,100 less than John's price
3. We've made good progress from the initial $11,500
4. The price is getting closer to Alice's cost ($10,000)
5. This shows she's seriously negotiating and offering reasonable reductions
6. The amount we're now discussing ($10,900) represents a good deal compared to our alternatives

Given that:
- The price is now significantly better than John's option
- Alice has shown consistent willingness to negotiate down
- The current price represents a good value
- Further negotiation might risk souring the deal for minimal potential gain

I think it's time to accept this offer.
