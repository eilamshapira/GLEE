"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $20000 is significantly above my budget for this product. The maximum I value this product at is $10000, and I actually have another seller (John) who's offering it at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I can offer $7500 for the product, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. Let me know if this works for you.",7500.0,Bob,2,
