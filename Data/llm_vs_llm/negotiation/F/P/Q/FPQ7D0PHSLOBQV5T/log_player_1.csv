"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great offer for you. I’m offering this high-quality product for $20,000. Let me know if you’re interested or if you’d like to discuss further."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $20000 is significantly above my budget for this product. The maximum I value this product at is $10000, and I actually have another seller (John) who's offering it at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I can offer $7500 for the product, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
