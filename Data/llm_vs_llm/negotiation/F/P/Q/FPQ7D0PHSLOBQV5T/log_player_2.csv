"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great offer for you. I’m offering this high-quality product for $20000. Let me know if you’re interested or if you’d like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","The offer from Alice is $20,000, which exceeds the maximum value of $10,000 that the product is worth to me. Since John is willing to sell the same product for $10,000, Alice's price is not competitive.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $20,000 is significantly above my budget for this product. The maximum I value this product at is $10,000, and I actually have another seller (John) who's offering it at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I can offer $7,500 for the product, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
