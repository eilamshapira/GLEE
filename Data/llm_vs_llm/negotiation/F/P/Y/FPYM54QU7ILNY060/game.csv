"Alice, thanks for your offer. Given alternative options available, I’m prepared to make a deal at $12000 for the product. I believe this benefits both of us—ensuring a fair margin for you and a solid investment for me. Let me know if we can agree on this price.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $12000 is certainly attractive, I know the true value of this product is closer to $14000.  How about we meet in the middle at $13000? This allows me a reasonable profit while still offering you a significant saving compared to its potential worth to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
