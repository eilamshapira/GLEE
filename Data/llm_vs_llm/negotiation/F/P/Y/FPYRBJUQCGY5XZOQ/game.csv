"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $15000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product is worth more than $10000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $12500. Let me know if this price works for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12500 is still a little higher than what I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $11500, which is a fair middle ground. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm going to have to ask for $12000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable selling the product for. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'd be happy to sell it to you.",12000.0,Alice,5,
