Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us. My counteroffer will be $12,500. This price is still higher than what I'm willing to accept, but it shows that I'm open to negotiating and finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $15,000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product is worth more than $10,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $12,500. Let me know if this price works for you.""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12500 is still a little higher than what I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $11500, which is a fair middle ground. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, trying to get closer to a price that I'm comfortable with. Since Bob is willing to go up to $11,500, I'll try to meet him in the middle of our previous offers. My counteroffer will be $12,000, but I'm also considering the fact that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $12,000. I might as well try to get Bob to match that price.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.

If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'd be happy to sell it to you."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
