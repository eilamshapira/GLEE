"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. Since I can get the same product from another seller at $150, I was hoping we could reach a better deal. Would you consider selling it for $120? This would make it more attractive for me to buy from you rather than from other sellers.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but considering the quality of the product, I'm willing to offer it for $135. Let me know if that works for you.",135.0,Alice,3,
