"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
 
There's no point in accepting Alice's offer since it's the same price as John's offer.  You can save a potential negotiation by going directly to John."
