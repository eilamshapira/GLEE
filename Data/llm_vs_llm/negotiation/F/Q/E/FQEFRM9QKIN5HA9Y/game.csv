"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer of $140, but I need to stay closer to my original price given the product's quality and value. I can come down to $165, which is already a significant discount from my initial offer. Would that work for you?",165.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $165, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $155. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",155.0,Bob,4,
