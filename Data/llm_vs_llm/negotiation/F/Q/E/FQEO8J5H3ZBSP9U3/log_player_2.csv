"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given the options, I'll analyze the situation:

1. Accept Alice's offer for $1,900,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John for $1,000,000

The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me. Alice's offer of $1,900,000 exceeds the value I place on the product and is also higher than John's price. John is offering the product at exactly what it's worth to me maximum.

The logical choice is to buy from John for $1,000,000, which allows me to get the product while saving $900,000 compared to Alice's offer.
