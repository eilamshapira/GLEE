"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $15,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a higher price to test Bob's willingness to pay.

{""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $8,000 as it's well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 (John's offer). However, I'll continue negotiating with Bob since we still have several rounds left.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's initial offer was quite low at $8,000, I'll lower my initial asking price but still keep it well above my minimum of $15,000 to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's new offer of $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Given that Bob's incremental increase was relatively small (from $8,000 to $9,500), and I have a guaranteed offer from John at $15,000, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's last two offers were quite low ($8,000 and $9,500), and his incremental increase was small, I'll lower my price but still maintain a significant margin above my minimum of $15,000.
