"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation, considering my maximum value is $12,000 and I have John's offer as a backup.

{""product_price"": 8000}

This counteroffer is strategically set at $8,000 because:
1. It's well below John's price of $12,000
2. It leaves room for negotiation upward
3. It signals to Alice that her initial offer of $25,000 was far too high
4. Even if Alice counters higher, I still have room to negotiate while staying under my $12,000 limit"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer is still significantly above my maximum value of $12,000 and above John's price. There's no reason to accept this offer when I can either negotiate further or buy from John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9500}

I'm increasing my offer slightly from my previous $8,000 to show some flexibility in negotiation, but still keeping it well below John's price of $12,000. This strategy:
1. Shows willingness to move up from my initial offer
2. Maintains a strong negotiating position since I have John's offer as backup
3. Keeps the price well within my maximum value of $12,000
4. Signals to Alice that I might be willing to increase further, but not dramatically

If Alice doesn't come down significantly in the next round, I can always exercise my option to buy from John at $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John for $12,000 because:
1. Alice's offer of $18,000 is still significantly above my maximum value of $12,000
2. Even though Alice has shown willingness to reduce her price, she's still far from a price that would be acceptable to me
3. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and the gap between our positions is still too large
4. John's offer of $12,000 is guaranteed and matches my maximum value
5. Continuing to negotiate with Alice might not lead to a better outcome, and I risk wasting more time

It's more rational to take John's guaranteed offer at my maximum acceptable price than to continue negotiating with Alice when she's still $6,000 above my limit."
