Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product for $600000, given that it aligns with the value I see in it. Let me know what you think.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, I'm afraid $600,000 is significantly below the product's value.

I can reduce my asking price to $1,050,000, which I believe is still a fair price considering the product's quality and potential returns. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $1050000 is still out of my budget. Considering your mention of a minimum value of $800000, I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer and reflects my strong interest in the product. Please let me know if this works for you.

However, as I mentioned, I already have another buyer willing to pay $800,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I understand budget constraints, but I simply cannot go below this amount.
