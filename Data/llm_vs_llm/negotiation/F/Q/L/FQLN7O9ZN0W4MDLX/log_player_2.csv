"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at $1200000, which I believe is a fair market price considering its quality and potential value. I'd be happy to discuss the details of this product with you further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,200,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product for $600,000, given that it aligns with the value I see in it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, I'm afraid $600000 is significantly below the product's value. This product has a minimum value of $800000 to me, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can reduce my asking price to $1050000, which I believe is still a fair price considering the product's quality and potential returns. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $1,050,000 is still out of my budget. Considering your mention of a minimum value of $800,000, I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer and reflects my strong interest in the product. Please let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your interest in the product. However, as I mentioned, I already have another buyer willing to pay $800000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I understand budget constraints, but I simply cannot go below this amount. Given our negotiation so far, I'm willing to come down to $900000, which is substantially lower than my initial offer. This represents excellent value for a product of this quality and potential. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your position and the value you place on the product. However, $900,000 is still above what I can afford. Given that you have a minimum price of $800,000, I'm willing to meet you at that price. This is the highest I can go, and it matches the price you mentioned another buyer is willing to pay. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
