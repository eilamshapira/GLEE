Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a high offer since I know I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, and the product is worth that much to me. However, I'll leave some room for negotiation with Bob.

{""product_price"": 1,800,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $900,000 as it's significantly below both my minimum value ($1,500,000) and John's guaranteed offer ($1,500,000). Since Bob's offer is even below what the product is worth to him ($1,000,000), I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round, but if we can't reach a suitable agreement, I can always sell to John.

{""product_price"": 1,600,000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1,600,000}

I'm lowering my initial price slightly to show some flexibility in negotiation, but still maintaining a price above my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. However, since I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, and I have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,500,000, if Bob doesn't significantly increase his next offer, I will likely choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John because:
1. Bob's new offer ($950,000) is still well below my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000)
2. Bob's offers have only increased marginally ($900,000 to $950,000), suggesting he's not willing to approach my minimum price
3. John's guaranteed offer ($1,500,000) matches my minimum acceptable value
4. Since the product is only worth $1,000,000 to Bob, he will never offer more than that amount, making further negotiation pointless

It's time to conclude this negotiation and take John's offer."
