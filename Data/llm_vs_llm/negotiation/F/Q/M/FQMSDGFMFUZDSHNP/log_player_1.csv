"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair price."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. How about we settle on $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a middle ground that's closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth more than $100. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $110 is still a bit out of my budget. Could we go for $105 instead? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer, trying to get closer to my target price. Since Bob is willing to increase his offer, I'll try to meet him halfway again. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I still think it's worth more than $105. How about we settle on $107.50?"", ""product_price"": 107.50}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I still think it's worth more than $105. How about we settle on $107.50?"", ""product_price"": 107.50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I'm trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $106? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $106 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $107.50, and we're running out of rounds, I think it's a good idea to accept his offer and close the deal. It's still above my minimum price of $80, and I've earned a good profit."
