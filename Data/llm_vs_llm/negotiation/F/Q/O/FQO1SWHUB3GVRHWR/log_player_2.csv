"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $11,900 against my alternatives.

The product is worth up to $12,000 to me, and I know that John will sell it for exactly $12,000.

Alice's offer of $11,900 is $100 less than John's price, and still below my maximum value for the product. By accepting Alice's offer, I can save $100 compared to buying from John.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, I should accept Alice's offer.
