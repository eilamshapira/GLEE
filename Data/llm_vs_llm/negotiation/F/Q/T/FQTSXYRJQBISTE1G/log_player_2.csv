"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's initial offer is $150, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and I also have the option to buy it from John for the same price, I don't see any benefit in accepting Alice's offer without trying to negotiate a better price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in hopes of getting a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, in an attempt to gauge her willingness to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $125 is a significant reduction from her initial offer of $150, indicating that she is willing to negotiate. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'll consider this offer. However, I'll also think about making another counteroffer to see if I can get an even better deal.

Given that Alice has already come down by $25, I'm hopeful that she might be willing to come down a bit further. I'll make another counteroffer, but this time, I'll make it more reasonable, considering the progress we've made so far.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll send a new counteroffer:
