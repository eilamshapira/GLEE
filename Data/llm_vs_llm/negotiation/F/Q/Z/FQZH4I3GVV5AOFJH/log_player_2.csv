"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I should aim to save as much money as possible, but I also don't want to risk not getting the product at all. $120 is less than my maximum of $150, so I should consider it. Let's see what the best choice is.

*   **Accept Alice's offer:** This is the most straightforward and guarantees I get the product for $120.
*   **Reject Alice's offer:** There's a chance Alice will offer a lower price later, but there's also a risk she'll stick to $120 or even increase it.
*   **Buy the product from John:** This guarantees I get the product, but for the maximum price I'm willing to pay, and I don't want to do that if I don't have to.

Since this is the first round, I want to see if I can get a better price.

**{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, let's try to get a better price. I will send a counteroffer.

**{""product_price"": 100}**"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Okay, Alice rejected my counteroffer, and now the price is $110.

*   **Accept Alice's offer:** This would get me the product for $110.
*   **Reject Alice's offer:** I could try to negotiate further, but the price could go up.
*   **Buy from John:** Guarantees the product for $150.

$110 is a good price, and it's still less than my budget. I'm going to accept.
