"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $25000. I believe it's a fair price, but I'm open to negotiations.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $25000 is beyond my budget. Given market alternatives, I'm willing to offer $6000 for the product. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $6000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's value and our previous discussion, I'm willing to make a concession. I can offer the product to you for $22000, which is still a competitive price given its quality and rarity.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for reconsidering, Alice. However, $22000 is still more than I can justify based on my evaluation. I can reasonably offer you $7500 for the product. I believe this can work out well for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and the slight increase in your offer. However, $7500 is still below the product's value. I'm willing to make another concession to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $20000, which I believe is a fair price considering its quality, rarity, and the negotiations so far.",20000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, considering my budget limitations and available alternatives, I'm inclined to offer $8500. I value the product but must also consider my financial boundaries. I hope we can meet closer to a deal.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and the slight increase in your offer. However, $8500 is still below my expectations. Considering the product's value and the progress we've made in our negotiations, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $18000, which I believe is a reasonable price given its quality and rarity. If we can't meet at this price, I may need to consider other options.",18000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. However, $18000 is still too steep for my budget. I'm willing to stretch my offer to $9000. I understand the product's value and hope we can negotiate to a mutually satisfactory conclusion.",9000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but $9000 is still not a price I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value and the fact that we're nearing the end of our negotiations, I'm willing to make one final concession. I can offer the product to you for $16500, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options that better align with the product's value.",16500.0,Alice,9,
