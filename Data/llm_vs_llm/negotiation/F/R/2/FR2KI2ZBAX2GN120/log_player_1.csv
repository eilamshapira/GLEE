"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $25,000. I believe it's a fair price, but I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $25000 is beyond my budget. Given market alternatives, I'm willing to offer $6000 for the product. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and the value I know the product holds, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. Selling to John for $15,000 is an option, but I want to explore the possibility of getting a better price from Bob first."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $6,000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's value and our previous discussion, I'm willing to make a concession. I can offer the product to you for $22,000, which is still a competitive price given its quality and rarity."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for reconsidering, Alice. However, $22000 is still more than I can justify based on my evaluation. I can reasonably offer you $7500 for the product. I believe this can work out well for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's new offer of $7,500 is still significantly lower than my expectations and the value I believe the product holds. While it's an improvement from his previous offer, I'm not ready to settle for this price yet. I will reject his offer and make another counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us. Selling to John for $15,000 remains an option, but I want to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and the slight increase in your offer. However, $7,500 is still below the product's value. I'm willing to make another concession to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $20,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its quality, rarity, and the negotiations so far."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, considering my budget limitations and available alternatives, I'm inclined to offer $8500. I value the product but must also consider my financial boundaries. I hope we can meet closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's new offer of $8,500 is still not close enough to my expectations, and I believe the product is worth more. While I appreciate his willingness to negotiate and the incremental increases in his offers, I'm not ready to settle for this price yet. I will reject his offer and make another counteroffer, trying to find a mutually acceptable price. However, I'm starting to consider selling to John for $15,000 as a more viable option if Bob's offers don't improve significantly in the next few rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and the slight increase in your offer. However, $8,500 is still below my expectations. Considering the product's value and the progress we've made in our negotiations, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $18,000, which I believe is a reasonable price given its quality and rarity. If we can't meet at this price, I may need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. However, $18000 is still too steep for my budget. I'm willing to stretch my offer to $9000. I understand the product's value and hope we can negotiate to a mutually satisfactory conclusion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's new offer of $9,000 is still significantly lower than my expectations, and I don't feel that it reflects the product's true value. While I appreciate his willingness to continue negotiating, I'm starting to feel that we may not be able to reach a mutually acceptable price. Given the relatively small increments in Bob's offers and the significant gap between his offer and my expectations, I'm leaning towards selling to John for $15,000. However, I'll give Bob one more chance to make a serious offer. I'll reject his current offer and make another counteroffer, but I'll be prepared to walk away if it's not satisfactory."

Round 9

Considering the product's value and the fact that we're nearing the end of our negotiations, I'm willing to make one final concession. I can offer the product to you for $16,500, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options that better align with the product's value."", ""product_price"": 16500}"
