"Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $10000 is too low for this product's value. I can reduce my initial price to $17000. This is still a great value considering the product's quality and features. Would this work better for you?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your negotiation, Bob, but $11000 is still below what I can accept for this product. Let me meet you closer to the middle - I can offer it for $15000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and reflects the true value of the product.",15000.0,Alice,5,
