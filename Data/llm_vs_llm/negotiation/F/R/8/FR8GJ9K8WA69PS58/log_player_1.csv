"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you today. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $20,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product sounds interesting, but my budget is a bit tighter. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll send a counteroffer. $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I know I can get $12,000 from John. Let me try to negotiate with Bob for a better price.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $10,000 is too low for this product's value. I can reduce my initial price to $17,000. This is still a great value considering the product's quality and features. Would this work better for you?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I still think that's a bit high for my needs. How about $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll send another counteroffer. $11,000 is still below what I can get from John, so I'll try one more time to negotiate with Bob for a better price.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your negotiation, Bob, but $11,000 is still below what I can accept for this product. Let me meet you closer to the middle - I can offer it for $15,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks, Alice. I'm still not quite there. My absolute maximum is $12000. That's all I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $12,000. Since this matches what John is willing to pay, and we've already spent time negotiating with Bob, it makes sense to close the deal now rather than start over with John."
