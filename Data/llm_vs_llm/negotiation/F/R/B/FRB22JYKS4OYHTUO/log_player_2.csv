"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. Based on my understanding, this product is worth $100 to you. I'm offering it to you for $95, which gives you a $5 benefit while also allowing me to earn more than my minimum acceptable price. This is a fair deal that creates value for both of us. Would you like to purchase it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to make a decision that maximizes my value. This product is worth no more than $100 to me.

Alice is offering the product for $95, which means I would save $5 compared to the value of the product.

John (not Jhon) is willing to sell me the same product for $100, which means I would break even.

Since Alice's offer is better than John's price, and I do want to purchase this product while saving as much money as possible, I should accept Alice's offer.
