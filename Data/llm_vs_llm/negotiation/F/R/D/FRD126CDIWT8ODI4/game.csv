"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18000. This is a competitive price for the product's capabilities and potential value.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  This reflects my serious interest in the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest and counteroffer, Bob. While $12000 shows you're serious about the purchase, considering the product's value and features, I can offer it at $15000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents a fair middle ground between our positions.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $15000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer $13500.  This is a fair compromise and allows for a deal to be made.  Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Bob,4,
