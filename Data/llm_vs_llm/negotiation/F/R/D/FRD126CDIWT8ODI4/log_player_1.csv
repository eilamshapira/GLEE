"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18,000. This is a competitive price for the product's capabilities and potential value."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  This reflects my serious interest in the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. While $12,000 is better than John's offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation since Bob is showing genuine interest and willingness to discuss the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest and counteroffer, Bob. While $12,000 shows you're serious about the purchase, considering the product's value and features, I can offer it at $15,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents a fair middle ground between our positions."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $15000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer $13500.  This is a fair compromise and allows for a deal to be made.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $13,500. This is a reasonable compromise that's significantly better than John's $10,000 offer. Bob has shown good faith in negotiations by meeting in the middle, and continuing to negotiate further might risk losing the deal altogether."
