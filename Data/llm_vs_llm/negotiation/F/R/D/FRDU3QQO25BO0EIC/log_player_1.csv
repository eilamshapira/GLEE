Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider the best approach here. Bob values the product at $100, which is the same as its value to me. If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell it to John for $100.

Since Bob won't pay more than the $100 value he places on the product, and I can already get $100 from John, there's no strategic advantage in offering a lower price to Bob.
