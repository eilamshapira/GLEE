"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really value. I'm offering it to you for $12000.  It's a great deal considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a bit high. Considering the product's worth to me, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to meet me at this price.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to get at least $10000 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'll offer you the product for $10000.  This is a great price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the value you'll get.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10000. However, I'm still a bit short of being comfortable with that price. Considering we're both trying to meet in the middle, I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9500. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to finalize the deal if you're willing to accept this price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
