Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a bit high. Considering the product's worth to me, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10000. However, I'm still a bit short of being comfortable with that price. Considering we're both trying to meet in the middle, I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9500. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to finalize the deal if you're willing to accept this price.
