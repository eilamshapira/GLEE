Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $2000000 is outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1000000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, as selling to John for $1,500,000 is my fallback option. Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is too low, but there's still room for negotiation between my initial offer of $2,000,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $1,000,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1750000 is still a bit high for me.  I can go up to $1250000.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to the product's value to me, but it's still below the $1,500,000 that John is willing to pay. I will make another counteroffer to Bob to see if we can reach a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your increased offer. However, I must insist on a price that reflects the true value of the product. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,625,000 to meet you partway."", ""product_price"": 1625000}"

Bob's offer:

Bob's final offer of $1,400,000 is still below the $1,500,000 that John is willing to pay. Since Bob indicated that he's at his maximum price, it's better to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
