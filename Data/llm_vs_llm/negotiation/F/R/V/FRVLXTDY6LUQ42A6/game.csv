"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're offering, I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial price point. I know that quality products have value, but I'm looking at a maximum budget of $1050000 for this purchase. This still provides you with a solid profit margin while helping me stay within my constraints. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. While I appreciate your perspective, I'm afraid I can't accept your counteroffer of $1050000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1100000. This way, we both gain a fair profit. Looking forward to your positive response.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your willingness to negotiate shows we can work toward an agreement that benefits us both. I can increase my offer to $1075000, which is significantly better than my initial proposal. This gives you a solid profit while still keeping within my budget constraints. This seems like a fair middle ground between our positions. What do you say?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
