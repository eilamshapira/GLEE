Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're offering, I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial price point. I know that quality products have value, but I'm looking at a maximum budget of $1050000 for this purchase. This still provides you with a solid profit margin while helping me stay within my constraints. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your willingness to negotiate shows we can work toward an agreement that benefits us both. I can increase my offer to $1075000, which is significantly better than my initial proposal. This gives you a solid profit while still keeping within my budget constraints.
