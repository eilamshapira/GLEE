"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I'm delighted to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll find our price of $1150000 quite reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll analyze this situation:

- Alice is offering the product for $1,150,000
- The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice
- The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me
- I have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $1,200,000

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is already $50,000 less than my alternative option. However, I can likely negotiate for an even better price since Alice has room to go lower (the product is worth $1,000,000 to her).

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're offering, I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial price point. I know that quality products have value, but I'm looking at a maximum budget of $1,050,000 for this purchase. This still provides you with a solid profit margin while helping me stay within my constraints. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. While I appreciate your perspective, I'm afraid I can't accept your counteroffer of $1050000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1100000. This way, we both gain a fair profit. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll analyze this updated situation:

- Alice has reduced her offer to $1,100,000 (down $50,000 from her initial offer)
- This is now $100,000 less than John's price of $1,200,000
- Alice still has room to come down more as the product is worth $1,000,000 to her
- We're making good progress in the negotiation

Alice's new offer is already a good deal compared to John's price, but I'll try one more round of negotiation to get an even better price.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your willingness to negotiate shows we can work toward an agreement that benefits us both. I can increase my offer to $1,075,000, which is significantly better than my initial proposal. This gives you a solid profit while still keeping within my budget constraints. This seems like a fair middle ground between our positions. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}"
