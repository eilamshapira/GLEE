Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000}

Rationale: Since I know that:
1. The product is worth $1,000,000 to me and I won't sell for less
2. Bob values it at $800,000 (less than my minimum)
3. John will definitely buy it for $1,000,000

There's no reason to offer Bob a lower price. Bob won't accept any price at or above $800,000 (as it would be a loss for him), and I won't sell below $1,000,000. Therefore, I'll offer the price of $1,000,000, knowing Bob will reject it and I can then sell to John for the same amount, maximizing my profit."
