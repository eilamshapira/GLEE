"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1200000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be transparent - the product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me at exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product, which would save me some money while still providing you with a substantial sale. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your honesty about the product's value to you. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't let this go for $800000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1000000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true worth of this product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
