Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be transparent - the product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me at exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product, which would save me some money while still providing you with a substantial sale. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
