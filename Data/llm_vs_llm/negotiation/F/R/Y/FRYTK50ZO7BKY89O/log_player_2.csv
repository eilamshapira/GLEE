"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1200000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I notice that Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is actually more than the $1,000,000 maximum value it has to me. It's also more expensive than John's guaranteed price of $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be transparent - the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me at exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product, which would save me some money while still providing you with a substantial sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your honesty about the product's value to you. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't let this go for $800000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1000000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true worth of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has come down to $1,000,000, which is the same price John is offering and matches the maximum value the product has to me. At this point, there's no advantage to continuing negotiations since we've reached the market price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
