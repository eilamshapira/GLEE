Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $600,000, which is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, I will reject it and proceed to the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a tough one. Bob's offer of $700,000 is still below my minimum. However, the negotiation isn't going well, and Bob is clearly unwilling to pay anywhere near my asking price.

I have two options: keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a higher price, or cut my losses and sell to John for $1,200,000. Considering the risk of Bob walking away or further lowering his offers, the safer, more lucrative option is to sell to John.
