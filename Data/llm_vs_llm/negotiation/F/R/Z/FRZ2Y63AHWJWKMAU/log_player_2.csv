"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since the offered price of $1,400,000 is above my maximum budget of $800,000, it doesn't make sense to accept this offer. Additionally, buying from John for $800,000 is within my budget, but I want to try to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price that is lower than $800,000 or at least closer to it than $1,400,000. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is reasonable and within my budget. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a lower offer and see how Alice responds.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,300,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. While it's a decrease from her previous offer, it's not enough to make it an attractive option for me. Buying from John for $800,000 is still a viable option, but I'm willing to continue negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a better price.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer, trying to bring the price closer to my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice rejected my previous offer of $600,000 and came back with a price of $1,300,000, I'll try to meet her halfway and make a more reasonable counteroffer. I'll increase my previous offer by $100,000 to show that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
