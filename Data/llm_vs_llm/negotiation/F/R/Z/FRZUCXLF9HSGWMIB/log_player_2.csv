"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product that I think you'll really love. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and John is offering it at exactly $80, while Alice's price is significantly higher at $200, the most rational decision is to buy from John. This way, I'm getting the product I want at the maximum price I'm willing to pay, saving $120 compared to Alice's offer."
