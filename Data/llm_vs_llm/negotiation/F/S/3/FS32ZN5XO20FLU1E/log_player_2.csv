"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given that Alice's offer is $15,000, which is the same price as John's offer, and it's also the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I should reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price with Alice. There's potential to save money by making a counteroffer, whereas accepting now or buying from John would both cost the maximum amount.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower to leave room for negotiation but not so low as to be considered unreasonable.

{""product_price"": 10000}

This offer is about 33% lower than Alice's initial offer. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation as it's not too aggressive to shut down the conversation, but still gives room for back-and-forth negotiation while potentially saving me a significant amount compared to the $15,000 maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price by $1,000, showing willingness to negotiate. While $14,000 is better than the $15,000 from John, there might still be room for further negotiation. Since Alice moved $1,000 from her initial position, I'll try one more round of negotiation to potentially save more money.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down $1,000 from her initial offer, I'll raise my previous offer by a similar amount to show good faith in the negotiation. This way, we're both making concessions.

{""product_price"": 11500}

This offer splits the difference between my previous offer ($10,000) and Alice's latest offer ($14,000). It shows I'm willing to move significantly from my initial position while still trying to secure a good deal that's well below the maximum price of $15,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has shown consistent willingness to negotiate by reducing her price again to $13,500, which is now $1,500 less than John's price. While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk that pushing too hard might make Alice less willing to negotiate further. The current offer represents a significant savings of $1,500 compared to our maximum price, and it's a fair compromise between our positions. I'll accept this offer.
