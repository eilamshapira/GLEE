"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of significant value to you. After careful consideration, I'd like to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a fair market price that reflects the product's true worth. I have another interested buyer, John, who is prepared to pay the full asking price, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity to acquire it.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
