"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $2500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I value this product around $800000. Would you consider an offer of $800000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your initial offer, but this product truly has exceptional potential.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $2000000 is still considerably outside my price range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000, which I believe is a fair price for the product.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your efforts, the price is still too high.  I can go up to $1000000.  This is a substantial offer and the highest I'm willing to go. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider John's offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1500000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm standing firm at $1000000.  If you can't accept that, I have to go with John's offer, even though I'd prefer to work with you.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
