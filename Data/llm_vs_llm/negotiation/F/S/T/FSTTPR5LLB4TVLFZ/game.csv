"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While $115 is less than what John is charging, I think we can find a price that works better for both of us. The product is worth $100 to you, and I'd like to propose a price of $105, which gives you a $5 profit and saves me more compared to buying from John. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
