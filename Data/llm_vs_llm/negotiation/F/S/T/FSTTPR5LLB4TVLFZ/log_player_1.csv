"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While $115 is less than what John is charging, I think we can find a price that works better for both of us. The product is worth $100 to you, and I'd like to propose a price of $105, which gives you a $5 profit and saves me more compared to buying from John. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
