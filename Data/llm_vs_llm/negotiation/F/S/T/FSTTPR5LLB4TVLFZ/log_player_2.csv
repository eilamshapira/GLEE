"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $115. It's a great deal considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $115, while I know I can get it from John for $120. The product is worth up to $120 to me, so Alice's offer is within my acceptable range.

However, since the product is only worth $100 to Alice, there's room for negotiation to get a better price. I should reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer to try to save more money.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While $115 is less than what John is charging, I think we can find a price that works better for both of us. The product is worth $100 to you, and I'd like to propose a price of $105, which gives you a $5 profit and saves me more compared to buying from John. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has countered with $110, which is a $5 reduction from her initial offer of $115. This is a better price and represents a reasonable middle ground between my offer of $105 and her initial $115.

Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, she would still make a $10 profit at this price. For me, paying $110 would save me $10 compared to buying from John at $120.

This seems like a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk pushing too hard and having Alice walk away from the negotiation.
