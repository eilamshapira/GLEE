"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Considering its unique value and the significant benefits it offers, I'm offering it to you for $900000. This is a fantastic deal for you, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer is $900,000
2. The product is worth $1,000,000 to me (maximum I'm willing to pay)
3. John's price is $1,000,000
4. Alice's costs are $800,000

Alice's offer at $900,000 is:
- $100,000 less than John's price
- $100,000 below my maximum value
- Gives me a better deal than buying from John

Since:
1. Alice's offer is below my maximum value
2. It saves me $100,000 compared to buying from John
3. It's a reasonable price considering Alice's costs
