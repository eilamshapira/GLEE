"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","$80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, I won't accept any offer below that amount. However, I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, as there's still potential to make more than $120.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still maintain a price well above my minimum to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","$95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Since Bob's second offer only increased by $15 (from $80 to $95), it seems he might not be willing to reach my minimum price. Rather than continuing the negotiation with the risk of not reaching an agreement, I'll take the guaranteed sale to John.
