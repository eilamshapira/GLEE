"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1.2 million is quite high for this product, especially considering I can get it elsewhere for the same price. I value our potential business relationship and would like to make a fair offer that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product, which would still provide you with a substantial profit margin. How does this sound?",900000.0,Bob,2,
