"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1.2 million is quite high for this product, especially considering I can get it elsewhere for the same price. I value our potential business relationship and would like to make a fair offer that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product, which would still provide you with a substantial profit margin. How does this sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
