"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you the product at $1200000. This is a premium offer reflecting the excellence and unique value of the item. Let me know if you’d like to proceed or if you have any thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price Alice is offering ($1,200,000) is equal to John's price and at my maximum limit. Since Alice's cost is $800,000, there should be room for negotiation to get a better price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me while still allowing Alice to make a profit."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1.2 million is quite high for this product, especially considering I can get it elsewhere for the same price. I value our potential business relationship and would like to make a fair offer that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product, which would still provide you with a substantial profit margin. How does this sound?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, considering the product’s unique quality and established market standing, I’m countering with a price of $1050000. Let’s work together to reach a fair agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $1,050,000. This is a reasonable price that's $150,000 less than John's price and my maximum limit. Alice has moved significantly from her initial offer of $1.2 million, and this price point gives her a fair profit while saving me money. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing this good deal, as Alice might not be willing to go much lower given her costs and the market value."
