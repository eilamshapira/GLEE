"Hello Alice, thank you for offering your product to me. I believe it's a high-quality product, but the price is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $9000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $12500. This way, we both make a compromise.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your counteroffer. I'd like to propose a price of $10250.",10250.0,Bob,4,
