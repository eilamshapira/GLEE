"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know I can get the product for $120 from John, and that's my maximum value for the product, I'll make a reasonable but lower counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 100}

This offer gives Alice a chance to make a profit if her cost is low enough, while still being beneficial for me compared to John's price."
