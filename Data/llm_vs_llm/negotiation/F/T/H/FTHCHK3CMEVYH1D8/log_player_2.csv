"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe you'd find very valuable. It's worth at least $8000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500.  This is a significant discount from its true market value.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth up to $10,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $9,500
3. John's fixed price is $10,000
4. Alice's cost is $8,000

Alice's offer of $9,500 is $500 less than John's price of $10,000. While Alice is making a significant profit ($1,500), the offer is still better than John's price. Since I want to save as much money as possible and Alice's offer is the lower of the two options, I should accept her offer.
