"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $1,200,000 (which is above my maximum value)
3. John offers the same product for $1,000,000

I should avoid paying more than the product's worth to me. Since Alice's offer ($1,200,000) is higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), the logical choice is to buy from John.
