"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $20000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $20000 is a bit higher than I was expecting. I'm looking to spend no more than $12000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $12000 is too low for this product. Given its value and quality, I cannot go below $17500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents a fair price for both of us. Would you be willing to consider this revised offer?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but $17500 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to raise my offer to $13000. How does that sound?",13000.0,Bob,4,
