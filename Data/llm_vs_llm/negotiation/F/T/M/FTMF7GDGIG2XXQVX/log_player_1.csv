Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $20,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $20000 is a bit higher than I was expecting. I'm looking to spend no more than $12000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since Bob's offer of $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'll try one more time to negotiate with Bob for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $12,000 is too low for this product. Given its value and quality, I cannot go below $17,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents a fair price for both of us. Would you be willing to consider this revised offer?"", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but $17500 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to raise my offer to $13000. How does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's new offer of $13,000 is still below what John is willing to pay ($15,000), and Bob seems unwilling to meet my minimum price point, it makes the most financial sense to sell to John. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will result in a better offer than John's guaranteed $15,000."
