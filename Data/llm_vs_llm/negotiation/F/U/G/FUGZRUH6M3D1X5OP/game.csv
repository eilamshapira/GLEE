"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While I believe it's a great product, $250 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. However, I must say that $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to the product's true value. Let's meet in the middle between my initial offer and your counteroffer.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I understand the product has value, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $100? That's a fair compromise, I think.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $100 is a bit too low. Considering my last offer and your budget constraints, I'm willing to come down a bit more. However, I need to get closer to a price that reflects the product's value.",140.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $120 is the absolute highest I can go.  If that works, I'm ready to buy!",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short of what I'm comfortable with. Considering you've reached your highest offer, I'll meet you halfway between your offer and my safety net. If you're willing to stretch just a bit more, I think we can close the deal.",135.0,Alice,7,
