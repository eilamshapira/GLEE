Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. However, I must say that $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to the product's true value. Let's meet in the middle between my initial offer and your counteroffer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $100 is a bit too low. Considering my last offer and your budget constraints, I'm willing to come down a bit more. However, I need to get closer to a price that reflects the product's value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short of what I'm comfortable with. Considering you've reached your highest offer, I'll meet you halfway between your offer and my safety net. If you're willing to stretch just a bit more, I think we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower. It's better to secure the product at the known $120 price from John than to risk further negotiation with Alice."
