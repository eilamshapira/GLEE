"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Based on the information given, the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and John is offering it for exactly $120. Alice's offer of $150 is higher than both my maximum valuation and John's alternative price.

Since Alice's offer exceeds my valuation and I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at my maximum valuation price, the rational decision is to reject Alice's offer and potentially negotiate further, or simply buy from John.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $130 is still higher than John's guaranteed price of $120. Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and I can definitely buy it for $120 from John, I should not accept Alice's offer of $130.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's offer of $125 is still higher than John's guaranteed price of $120. Since I can buy the exact same product from John for $120, which is my maximum valuation for the product, there's no reason to accept Alice's higher price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has now offered the product at $120, which is exactly the same price as John's offer and matches my maximum valuation for the product. At this point, I'm indifferent between buying from Alice or John since the price is the same.

Since continuing negotiations further might risk Alice raising her price again, and there's likely no advantage to be gained by making another counteroffer (as $120 is already at my maximum valuation), I'll accept Alice's current offer.
