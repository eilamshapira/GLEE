Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $13,000 is significantly higher than John's fixed price of $10,000 and represents a reasonable profit margin above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, I'll accept this offer.
