"Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $3,000,000, which is above my willing-to-pay price, and I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, I will choose to buy from John as it aligns with my budget and saves me money.
