"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a moderately high offer, considering my minimum acceptable price is $12,000 and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price.

{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, and Bob's offer is even below his own value of $8,000, there's no reason to accept this very low offer. However, I'll reject and continue negotiating for now, as there might be room for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer, but still maintain a price above my minimum threshold.

{""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's new offer of $7,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and he's only increased his offer by $1,000. Given that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, and we seem to be making very slow progress in the negotiation, it's best to end the negotiation and take John's offer.
