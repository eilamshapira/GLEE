This price reflects the product's worth while still leaving room for you to derive value from it. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the market value. Would you be willing to sell it to me for this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $10000 is too low considering the product's value. I can come down to $12500, which I believe is a fair price that would benefit both of us. Would you accept this offer?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $10000 was too low, but I'm still not comfortable with $12500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11250. This price reflects a compromise between your initial offer and my previous counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for this price?",11250.0,Bob,4,
