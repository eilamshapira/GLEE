Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $13,500.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the market value. Would you be willing to sell it to me for this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer because Bob's offer of $10,000 is too low, considering the product is worth $15,000 to him. There's still room for negotiation between his initial offer and my initial asking price.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $10,000 is too low considering the product's value. I can come down to $12,500, which I believe is a fair price that would benefit both of us. Would you accept this offer?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $10000 was too low, but I'm still not comfortable with $12500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11250. This price reflects a compromise between your initial offer and my previous counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'll accept Bob's offer of $11,250. This is a reasonable compromise that gives me $1,250 more than John's guaranteed offer of $10,000. While it's less than my initial asking price, it's still a profitable deal, and continuing to negotiate might risk Bob walking away entirely."
