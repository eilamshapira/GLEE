"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $2000000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2000000 is far beyond my budget. I am willing to pay $500000 for the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $500000 is significantly lower than its value. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make a concession. I can offer the product to you for $1800000, which is still a premium price but closer to what I believe you might be willing to pay.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. But I still think that is too expensive. I'm prepared to offer $600000.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that you're willing to increase your offer, but $600000 is still far from the product's true value. I'm willing to make another concession, considering your interest in the product. I can offer it to you for $1600000. This is a serious compromise, and I hope you'll consider it carefully.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, while I appreciate the continued price reductions, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000. That's my final offer.",700000.0,Bob,6,
