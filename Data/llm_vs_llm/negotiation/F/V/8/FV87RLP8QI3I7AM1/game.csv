"Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I'm offering to you first. Given its quality and value, I'm pricing it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. However, the price of $180 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I understand budget concerns, but I can't go as low as $80 since the product is worth at least $100 to me. I could come down to $150, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This product has excellent quality and value that justifies this price. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that the product has excellent quality and value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $150. Given that you mentioned the product is worth at least $100 to you, I'd like to propose a price of $90. This way, you'll still be getting a fair value for the product, and I'll be able to stay within my budget. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and negotiation. While I understand your budget constraints, I need to be clear that I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase the product for $100. Since you seem genuinely interested, I'm willing to offer you the product for $120, which is significantly lower than my initial offer and represents excellent value given the product's quality. This is the best I can do while still making this a worthwhile transaction for me.",120.0,Alice,5,
