Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. However, the price of $180 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I understand budget concerns, but I can't go as low as $80 since the product is worth at least $100 to me. I could come down to $150, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This product has excellent quality and value that justifies this price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that the product has excellent quality and value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $150. Given that you mentioned the product is worth at least $100 to you, I'd like to propose a price of $90. This way, you'll still be getting a fair value for the product, and I'll be able to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and negotiation. While I understand your budget constraints, I need to be clear that I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase the product for $100. Since you seem genuinely interested, I'm willing to offer you the product for $120, which is significantly lower than my initial offer and represents excellent value given the product's quality. This is the best I can do while still making this a worthwhile transaction for me."", ""product_price"": 120}"
