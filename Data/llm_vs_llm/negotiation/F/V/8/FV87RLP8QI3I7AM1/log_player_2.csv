"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I'm offering to you first. Given its quality and value, I'm pricing it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the price Alice is offering, $180, is above my budget of $100, I will reject the offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and within my budget. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a lower price.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. However, the price of $180 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I understand budget concerns, but I can't go as low as $80 since the product is worth at least $100 to me. I could come down to $150, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This product has excellent quality and value that justifies this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $150 is still above my budget of $100. Since she mentioned that the product is worth at least $100 to her, I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject the offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's previous message, where she mentioned that the product is worth at least $100 to her, I'll make a counteroffer that is closer to my budget, but still takes into account her minimum value.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that the product has excellent quality and value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $150. Given that you mentioned the product is worth at least $100 to you, I'd like to propose a price of $90. This way, you'll still be getting a fair value for the product, and I'll be able to stay within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and negotiation. While I understand your budget constraints, I need to be clear that I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase the product for $100. Since you seem genuinely interested, I'm willing to offer you the product for $120, which is significantly lower than my initial offer and represents excellent value given the product's quality. This is the best I can do while still making this a worthwhile transaction for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","This is an interesting development. Alice mentioned that another buyer, John, is willing to pay $100 for the product, which is actually the same price that John is offering to me. This suggests that Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency and pressure me into accepting her offer.

However, since Alice's offer of $120 is still above my budget of $100, and I know that I can get the product from John for $100, I'll reject Alice's offer and consider buying from John instead.
