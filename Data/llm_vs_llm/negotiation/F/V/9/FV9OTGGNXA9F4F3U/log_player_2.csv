(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's initial offer of $140 is close to my maximum budget of $150, but still a bit high, I'd like to try to negotiate a better price. I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, to see how much room there is for negotiation. Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, I'll aim for a price that's closer to that value.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $130 is a bit more reasonable, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since she was willing to come down from $140 to $130, I'm hoping she'll be willing to come down further.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer. I'll try to meet her halfway between her new offer and my previous counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $130, and my previous counteroffer was $110, I'll try to split the difference and make a new counteroffer of $120. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and meet her halfway.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $125 is getting closer to my target price. Since she's only $5 away from my previous counteroffer of $120, I'm starting to think that we're nearing a mutually acceptable price.

However, I still think I can get a slightly better deal. I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to make a small concession to see if she'll meet me at a lower price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $125, and my previous counteroffer was $120, I'll try to make a small concession and offer $122. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and meet her closer to the middle.
