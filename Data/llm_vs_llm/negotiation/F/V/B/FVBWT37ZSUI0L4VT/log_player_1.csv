Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $12,000, I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I can still make a good profit.

{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 (which I can get from John), and also below Bob's own valuation of $12,000, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I know Bob values the product at $12,000, so I'll continue negotiating for a better price rather than immediately selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my initial offer of $15,000 and countered with $10,000, I'll lower my price but still keep it above $12,000 to aim for a better profit than selling to John.
