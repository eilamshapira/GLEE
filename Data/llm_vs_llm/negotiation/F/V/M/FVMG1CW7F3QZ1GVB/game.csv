Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a remarkable product that I believe you'll find invaluable. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. Let me know if you're interested!,1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $1500000 is far above my budget for this product. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $800000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a more reasonable price. I can offer $500000 for the product, which would save me money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. What do you think?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob! I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, I can't go as low as $500000. Considering the value of the product and the market, I can offer it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1200000 is still significantly above what I can justify spending. As I mentioned, John is offering the same product for $800000, and that's already at the upper limit of what the product is worth to me. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer you $650000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to John, and saves me some money compared to his offer. Does that work for you?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! Thank you for your continued interest and for your latest offer. While I appreciate your position, I can't accept $650000. To make this deal work for both of us, I can offer you the product for $1000000. This would still give you a significant saving compared to buying from John. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but there seems to be some confusion. You mentioned that $1000000 would give me significant savings compared to buying from John, but John's price is actually $800000 - so your offer would cost me $200000 more, not less. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me, and that's the price I can get elsewhere. Since I would prefer to do business with you, I can offer $750000, which is very close to my alternative option but would give us both the benefit of completing this deal. This is nearly the maximum I can pay while still making economic sense for me.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your latest offer of $750000. While it's a step in the right direction, I still can't accept that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900000. This would allow you to avoid going to John while respecting the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price again, but I need to be clear about my situation. The product is worth exactly $800000 to me - that's my absolute maximum. That's also precisely what John is charging. So while I'd like to do business with you, I cannot pay more than $800000 under any circumstances, as it wouldn't make financial sense for me. This is my final offer: $780000. This is slightly below what I'd pay John, giving me a small incentive to buy from you instead. If you can't accept this, I'll unfortunately have to go with John's offer.",780000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! Thank you for your honesty and for your final offer of $780000. I understand your position. However, I value this product highly and cannot go that low. I'm willing to lower my price slightly to $850000, which still reflects the product's worth while providing you a better deal than going with John. I hope we can find common ground here!",850000.0,Alice,9,
