"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $12,000 is a decent price, I believe there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely starting high, knowing we have a maximum budget in mind.  I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a significant reduction from Alice's starting price but still leaves room for negotiation while staying above Alice's perceived value of the product. Let's see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice is coming down, but slowly. It appears she's somewhat willing to negotiate. I'll reject this offer to signal I'm still looking for a better price without going too low too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to inch my offer up slightly to show Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe a price closer to $9000 is fair."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice is holding firm.  I'm willing to go a little higher, but I need to signal that my patience isn't unlimited.  I'll reject and see what her next move is."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

This offer shows Alice that I am still willing to negotiate but am not budging much further. It strikes a balance between trying to secure a good deal and not letting the negotiation drag on unnecessarily."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're getting close, but I think Alice might be willing to come down just a bit more. I want to signal that I'm serious, but not desperate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10,000}
```

This is my final offer. It's a round number that's a good compromise between my initial goal and Alice's desired price. If she rejects this, I'm going to walk away and buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice is not going to budge from this higher price point. While I'd prefer to pay less, it's not worth the risk of her further raising the price in the final round. Buying from John for $15,000 is not ideal, but it's better than potentially getting stuck with an even higher price from Alice."
