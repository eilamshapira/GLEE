"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you for a competitive price. I'd like to start the negotiation at $18000, considering its worth to me and its potential value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The offer from Alice is $18,000, which is significantly above both the $8,000 maximum I'm willing to pay and the alternative offer from John at $8,000. Since Alice is asking for more than double what the product is worth to me, and I have a guaranteed option to purchase from John at my maximum value, I should choose the third option.
