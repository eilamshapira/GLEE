{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While I'm willing to pay $150, there's no harm in seeing if Alice might sell it for less. I'll try a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 100

Let's start with a strong counteroffer to see how Alice responds. This leaves room for negotiation while still being a significant saving."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice is coming down, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and try to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 115

This counteroffer splits the difference between her last offer and my previous one. Let's see if she's willing to meet closer to the middle ground."
