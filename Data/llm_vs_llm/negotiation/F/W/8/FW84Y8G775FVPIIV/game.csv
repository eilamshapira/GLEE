"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $12000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you consider $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
"Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $10000 when I have a guaranteed alternative at $12000. I'll reject this offer and in the next round, I'll send him a counteroffer closer to $12000.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm going to have to stick with a price of $12000. This is a fair price given the quality and value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to proceed at this rate.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on the product. However, my budget is a bit tight. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob's offer doesn't meet the minimum value I require, and since I have a guaranteed sale to John at $12000, it's best to proceed with that option.",,Alice,4,SellToJhon
