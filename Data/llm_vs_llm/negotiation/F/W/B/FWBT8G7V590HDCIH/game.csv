"Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it for $150. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in making this purchase?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While the product looks good, $150 is more than I'm willing to pay. The same product is available from other sellers for $120, which is my maximum budget for this item. I'd be willing to buy it from you for $100, which would save me some money while still giving you a reasonable sale. Would that work for you?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept $100 as it's below my minimum price point. While you mentioned other sellers offering it at $120, that's actually the current market price. I can offer it to you for $135, which is still a better value considering the product's quality and immediate availability. Would this work better for you?",135.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down in price, Alice. However, as you've acknowledged, the market price for this product is $120, and that's actually my maximum budget for this item. I can offer you $110, which saves me a bit of money while still giving you a sale without me having to go to another seller. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $120, I'll unfortunately need to purchase from John at the market price.",110.0,Bob,4,
