"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it for $150. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While the product looks good, $150 is more than I'm willing to pay. The same product is available from other sellers for $120, which is my maximum budget for this item. I'd be willing to buy it from you for $100, which would save me some money while still giving you a reasonable sale. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. While Bob's argument about market availability is noted, I can always sell to John for $120, so accepting $100 would mean losing money. I'll try to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept $100 as it's below my minimum price point. While you mentioned other sellers offering it at $120, that's actually the current market price. I can offer it to you for $135, which is still a better value considering the product's quality and immediate availability. Would this work better for you?"", ""product_price"": 135}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down in price, Alice. However, as you've acknowledged, the market price for this product is $120, and that's actually my maximum budget for this item. I can offer you $110, which saves me a bit of money while still giving you a sale without me having to go to another seller. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $120, I'll unfortunately need to purchase from John at the market price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob has clearly stated his maximum price is $120 and is currently offering $110, and I know I can sell to John for $120, it makes the most financial sense to sell to John. There's no reason to continue negotiating when I can secure a better price immediately."
