"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it for $150. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in making this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice is offering the product for $150, which is more than both the $120 it's worth to me and the $120 I can buy it from John for. There's no reason to accept this offer when I can get the exact same product from John for $30 less.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While the product looks good, $150 is more than I'm willing to pay. The same product is available from other sellers for $120, which is my maximum budget for this item. I'd be willing to buy it from you for $100, which would save me some money while still giving you a reasonable sale. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept $100 as it's below my minimum price point. While you mentioned other sellers offering it at $120, that's actually the current market price. I can offer it to you for $135, which is still a better value considering the product's quality and immediate availability. Would this work better for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has reduced her offer to $135, but this is still higher than the $120 price I can get from John. Since she acknowledged that $120 is the market price, and I know the product is worth exactly $120 to me, there's no reason to pay more than that.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down in price, Alice. However, as you've acknowledged, the market price for this product is $120, and that's actually my maximum budget for this item. I can offer you $110, which saves me a bit of money while still giving you a sale without me having to go to another seller. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $120, I'll unfortunately need to purchase from John at the market price."", ""product_price"": 110}"
