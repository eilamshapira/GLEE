Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you my product. I believe it has great value and I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $100. But I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider selling it for $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
