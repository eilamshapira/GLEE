"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you my product. I believe it has great value and I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $200 is clearly above my maximum value of $100, and it's also higher than John's guaranteed price of $100. There's no reason to accept this offer. I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price than John's $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $100. But I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider selling it for $75?"", ""product_price"": 75}"
