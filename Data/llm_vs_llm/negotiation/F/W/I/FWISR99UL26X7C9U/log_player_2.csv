Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $200 is quite high for me as I know I can get this product elsewhere for $150. I value this product at no more than $150, but I'm willing to work with you. Would you consider $120? This would give us both room to negotiate to a fair price."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you think $200 is high, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $120. Considering your mention of $150 as a potential price, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $185, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $185. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $185
