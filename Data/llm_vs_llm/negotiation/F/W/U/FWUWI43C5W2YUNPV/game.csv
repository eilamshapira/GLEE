"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is far above what I'm willing to pay for this product. I understand you want to make a fair profit, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $8000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18000 may be out of your budget, but $8000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise and find a middle ground. I'll lower my price, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair value for the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $16000 is still significantly higher than what I can afford. I know the product has value, but I need to be practical about my budget. I can raise my offer to $9000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. Please consider this offer carefully.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $9000. I'm glad we're having an open and honest discussion about the price. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial price.",15000.0,Alice,5,
