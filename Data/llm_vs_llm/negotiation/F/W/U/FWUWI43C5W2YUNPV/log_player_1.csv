Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is far above what I'm willing to pay for this product. I understand you want to make a fair profit, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $8000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm hoping to find a mutually beneficial price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 may be out of your budget, but $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $16000 is still significantly higher than what I can afford. I know the product has value, but I need to be practical about my budget. I can raise my offer to $9000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. Please consider this offer carefully. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer in the next round. Although Bob has increased his offer, $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm hoping that with further negotiation, we can find a price that works for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $9,000. I'm glad we're having an open and honest discussion about the price.
