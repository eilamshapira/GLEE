"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll analyze this negotiation scenario.

Alice's current offer is $12,000, which is below my maximum value of $15,000. It's also $3,000 less than John's fixed price of $15,000.

Since this is just the first round and Alice's initial offer is already below my maximum threshold, I should try to negotiate for an even better price before accepting.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $9,000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has decreased her offer from $12,000 to $11,500, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This new price is $3,500 less than John's price, making it an even better deal. However, since Alice is showing flexibility and we still have several rounds remaining, I should try one more counteroffer to see if I can get an even better price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $10,000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has continued to lower her price, now offering $11,000, which is $4,000 less than John's price. She's moved down from $12,000 to $11,500 and now to $11,000, showing she's willing to negotiate but in smaller increments. While I could try another counteroffer, there's a risk she might become firmer or even raise the price if I push too hard. Since we're already getting a significant discount compared to John's price, and we've made good progress, I'll accept this offer.
