Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my approach carefully. The product is worth at least $12,000 to me, and I already have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price. However, if I can get Bob to pay more than $12,000, that would be better for me.

Bob values the product at $10,000, which is below my minimum acceptable price. This creates a challenge since there's no price point that would satisfy both of us. Any price between $10,000 and $12,000 would be acceptable to Bob but not to me.

Given this situation, I'll make an initial offer above my minimum price, leaving some room for negotiation, though I know we may not reach an agreement.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","After analyzing the situation:

1) The product is worth at least $12,000 to me
2) Bob's offer of $9,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price
3) I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000

Since Bob's offer is $3,000 below my minimum acceptable price, and there appears to be a significant gap between our valuations, it doesn't make sense to continue negotiating. Bob values the product at $10,000, so he will never offer me $12,000 or more, which is my minimum acceptable price.

The most rational decision is to take the guaranteed sale to John.
