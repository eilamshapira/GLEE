,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $25000 is far above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $8000.  This is my absolute top offer. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $8000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $22000?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $22000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product and you to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. $10000 is still too low for me to accept, considering my minimum. Let's meet in the middle a little more. How about $19000?",19000.0,Alice,5,
