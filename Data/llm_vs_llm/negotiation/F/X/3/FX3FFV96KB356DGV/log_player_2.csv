"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since the offered price of $18,000 is higher than my maximum budget of $15,000, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of negotiating a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll offer a price that is closer to my maximum budget of $15,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $16,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $15,000, but it's getting closer. Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $16,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between her offer and my previous counteroffer of $12,000. However, I'll also keep in mind that I can buy the product from John for $15,000, so I won't go too high.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $15,500 is very close to my maximum budget, but it's still $500 more than I can get the product from John. Since I can buy the product from John for $15,000, which is less than Alice's offer, I'll choose to buy from John instead of continuing to negotiate with Alice.
