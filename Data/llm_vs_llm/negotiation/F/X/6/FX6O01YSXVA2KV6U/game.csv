"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I believe the product could be valuable to me, $12000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $6000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, I cannot accept $6000 as that's below my minimum threshold. The product is worth significantly more than that. I can come down to $11000, which is already a good discount from my initial offer. This represents excellent value for the quality you'll be receiving.",11000.0,Alice,3,
