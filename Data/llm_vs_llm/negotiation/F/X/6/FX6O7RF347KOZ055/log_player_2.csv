(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if Alice can lower her price. After all, my maximum budget is $80, and Alice's offer is almost twice that amount. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I was hoping to spend less. Would you consider selling the product for $50?"", ""product_price"": 50}

Let's start the negotiation low and see how Alice responds. This will give me an idea of how flexible she is on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend less, but I believe the product's value is higher than $50. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. How about we meet at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer is still far higher than my maximum budget of $80. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $120 is still a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling the product for $65?"", ""product_price"": 65}

I'll increase my offer a bit to show good faith in negotiating, but I'll still keep it well below my maximum budget. Let's see how Alice responds to this counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to increase your offer, Bob. I appreciate that. I'll meet you halfway again. How about $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's new offer is still much higher than the $80 I'm willing to spend. It's clear that we won't reach an agreement that's within my budget. So it will be much easier to buy it from John."
