"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I notice that Alice's offer is $15,000, which is exactly the maximum amount I'm willing to pay based on my valuation of the product. It's also the same price that John is offering as an alternative.

Since both options would cost me the same $15,000, I might as well try to negotiate with Alice to see if I can get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I have nothing to lose by negotiating (John's alternative is already at my maximum price of $15,000), I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice in hopes of saving some money.
