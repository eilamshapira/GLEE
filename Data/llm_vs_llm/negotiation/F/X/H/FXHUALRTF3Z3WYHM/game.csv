"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest and counteroffer. While $10000 is lower than I'm willing to go, I understand the need to find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle a bit? I'm willing to come down to $16500. Let me know what you think.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate the effort. However, I'm still finding it a little high. Could you do $12500? That would work much better for me.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. I'm getting closer to a price that works for you. The lowest I can realistically go at this stage is $15750. This is a significant reduction and a very fair price for the value you'll be receiving.",15750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $15750 is getting closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about $13500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",13500.0,Bob,6,
