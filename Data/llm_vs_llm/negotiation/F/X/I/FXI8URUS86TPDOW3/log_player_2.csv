"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me. Alice's offer is $20,000. That's way too high. Buying from John for $8,000 is a much better option than accepting Alice's offer.
