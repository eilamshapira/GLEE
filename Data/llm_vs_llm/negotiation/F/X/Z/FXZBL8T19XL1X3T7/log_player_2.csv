"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m excited to offer you the product we discussed. It’s truly a unique opportunity, and I believe it can bring you immense value. I’m willing to sell it to you for $1200000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $1,200,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,000,000.
