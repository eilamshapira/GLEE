"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's offer of $14,000 is more than the $8,000 the product is worth to me, and also more than John's offer of $8,000, it doesn't make sense for me to accept. I could try to negotiate with Alice, but since John is already offering the product at the maximum value I place on it ($8,000), the most logical choice is to buy from John.
