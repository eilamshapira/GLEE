"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $3000000 is far beyond my budget. The maximum I can offer for the product is $650000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, after careful consideration, I'm willing to lower my price to $2200000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll be getting. I'm looking forward to your response.",2200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you've lowered the price, but $2200000 is still much higher than I can afford. My absolute maximum is $700000. I am ready to close the deal at that price.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, after giving it some thought, I'm willing to lower my price to $1700000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise given your budget constraints. I'm looking forward to your response.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the continued negotiation. However, $1700000 is still too high for me. I can offer $730000, which is my best and final offer.",730000.0,Bob,6,
