"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to counter with $7500. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $7500 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $9200.",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $9200 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not ready to go as low as $8000 just yet. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $8800.",8800.0,Alice,5,
