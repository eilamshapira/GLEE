"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to counter with $7500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $7,500 is lower than what I can get from John ($8,000), and it's also lower than the product's worth to me, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $7,500 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $9,200."", ""product_price"": 9200}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:

Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is the same as what I can get from John, and I believe the product is worth more to Bob, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not ready to go as low as $8,000 just yet. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $8,800."", ""product_price"": 8800}"

Since Bob's offer of $8,200 is higher than what I can get from John ($8,000), and it seems like Bob is making a genuine effort to compromise, I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $8,200. Continuing to negotiate may risk losing the sale, and $8,200 is a reasonable price considering the product's value."
