Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price...

Bob values the product at $10,000, so he won't pay more than that. If he rejects, I'm guaranteed $8,000 from John. I should set a price high enough to maximize my profit but not so high that Bob will definitely reject it. Since Bob would save any difference between $10,000 and my price, I'll offer it at $9,500, which gives him a $500 incentive to accept while maximizing my potential profit.
