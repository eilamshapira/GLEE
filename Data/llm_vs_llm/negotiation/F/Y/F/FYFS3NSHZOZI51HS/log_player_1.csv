"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $13,000 is lower than my minimum price of $15,000 and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

My counteroffer is: $19,000

So, the response is not one of the three options you specified, but rather a counteroffer. If I had to choose one of the options, it would be:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send Bob a counteroffer of $19,000.

Formally, the response is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 19000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 19000}"
