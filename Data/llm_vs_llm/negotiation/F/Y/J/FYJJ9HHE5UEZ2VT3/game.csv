"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $9000 is below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to lower the price to $14000, which still offers great value for the product. Let me know if this works for you!",14000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. However, $13000 is still a bit high for me. I can go up to $9500. What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $9500 is still below our minimum. I can go as low as $12500, which is very close to my bottom line. This is a final offer from my side. Let me know if you can meet this price!",12500.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. My final offer is $12500. This is the lowest I can go while still valuing the product appropriately. Please let me know if you can accept this price.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12500 is still above my budget. I can stretch to $10000, which is my final offer. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your final offer. Unfortunately, $10000 is still below our minimum acceptable price. I will have to sell the product to another buyer who is willing to meet our price. It was great negotiating with you, and I hope we can do business in the future.",,Alice,6,SellToJhon
