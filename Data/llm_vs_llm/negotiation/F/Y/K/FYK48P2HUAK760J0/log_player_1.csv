Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $10,000. Let me know if you'd like to accept this offer or if you have a counteroffer in mind."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $10000 is a bit high for me. Given that there are similar products in the market, I'd like to propose $7500 for the product. This would be a fair price that works for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
