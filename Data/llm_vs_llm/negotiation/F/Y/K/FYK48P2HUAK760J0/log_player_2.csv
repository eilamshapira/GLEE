"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $10000. Let me know if you'd like to accept this offer or if you have a counteroffer in mind. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that Alice's initial offer is $10,000, which is the same price as John's offer, it makes sense to reject and make a counteroffer. Since this is just the first round and we have 9 more rounds to negotiate, we should try to get a better price from Alice, especially since the product is worth $10,000 to her (her cost basis).

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonably low but not insulting first counteroffer to establish room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $10,000 is a bit high for me. Given that there are similar products in the market, I'd like to propose $7,500 for the product. This would be a fair price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}"
