"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you first before selling it elsewhere. Based on market research and the product's features, I'm offering it to you for $18500. This is a competitive price considering the product's value and capabilities. I already have another buyer, John, interested at a lower price, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity. Would you like to purchase at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to make a decision based on what's most economical for me. 

The key points:
- The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
- Alice is offering to sell it for $18,500
- John will sell me the same product for $10,000

Since Alice's offer ($18,500) exceeds both the value to me and John's price, the rational choice is to buy from John.
