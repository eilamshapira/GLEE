Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my offer to Bob. The product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price. However, if Bob values the product higher, I could potentially earn more.

Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I should set a price that balances the risk of rejection with the potential for higher profit. Setting the price too high might lead to rejection, while setting it too low would mean leaving money on the table.

Given that I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, I'll set my offer to Bob at a premium above this floor price.
