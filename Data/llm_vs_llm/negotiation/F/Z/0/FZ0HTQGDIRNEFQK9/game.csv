"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand you're on a budget, $10000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down a bit. I propose a price of $18000.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $18000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Could you do $12000? I think that's a fair price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
