"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Based on its quality and features, I'm offering it to you for $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","This is a tough one. Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my initial offer and even below my minimum. I need to weigh my options carefully.

Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand you're on a budget, $10,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down a bit. I propose a price of $18,000."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $18000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Could you do $12000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is now at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I could try to squeeze more out of him, but the risk of losing the deal is increasing with each round. Since I can sell to John for the same amount, I should make a move now to make some profit.

Here's my decision:
