"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be beneficial for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1750000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,750,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), it would not be rational to accept this offer. Given that John's price matches my maximum value and there's no guarantee that negotiating with Alice will result in a better price (especially since the product is worth $1,500,000 to her), the most logical decision is to buy from John.
