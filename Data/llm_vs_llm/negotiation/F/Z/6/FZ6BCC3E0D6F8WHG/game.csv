"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is too high for me. I can get this product from another seller for $80. I would like to offer you $60 for the product, which I believe is a fair price.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I value this product quite a bit higher. How about we meet in the middle? I can come down to $140.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $140 is still much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I want to be transparent - I can buy this product from another seller for $80, and that's my absolute maximum budget. To make it worth choosing you over the other seller, I would need a better price. I can offer $70.",70.0,Bob,4,
