"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product here that I think you might find quite valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price of $150 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $80, and also higher than John's offer. I'll reject and make a counteroffer to Alice in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is too high for me. I can get this product from another seller for $80. I would like to offer you $60 for the product, which I believe is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I value this product quite a bit higher. How about we meet in the middle? I can come down to $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's price of $140 is still well above both my maximum value ($80) and John's offer ($80). There's no reason to accept this offer when I can either negotiate further or buy from John for much less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $140 is still much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I want to be transparent - I can buy this product from another seller for $80, and that's my absolute maximum budget. To make it worth choosing you over the other seller, I would need a better price. I can offer $70."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about we try $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's price is still significantly above John's offer of $80, and we've gone through several rounds of negotiation with Alice only coming down slowly from $150 to $120. Given that I value the product at no more than $80 and can buy it from John at exactly $80, it makes more sense to end the negotiation and buy from John rather than continue negotiating with Alice, who seems unlikely to match or beat John's price."
