"Hello Bob, I'm excited about the possibility of you acquiring this exceptional product. It's truly a unique opportunity. To begin, I'm offering it to you for $25000. I believe this price reflects its significant value and the benefits it will bring to you.",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $25000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $10000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While $10000 is lower than I can accept, I appreciate you engaging in the negotiation. How about we meet in the middle a bit? I can offer it to you for $22000. This is a substantial reduction and I believe represents a fair price for both of us.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $22000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $12000. This is the maximum I can afford for this product. Let me know if you can accept this offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Okay Bob, I hear you. While $12000 is still below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's try $19000. It's a good jump down and I think we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price.",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $19000, but it's still a bit out of my budget. I can stretch to $13000. This is really the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",13000.0,Bob,6,
