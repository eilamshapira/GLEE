Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit.

{""product_price"": 1,100,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","$900,000 is a bit too low considering the product's value to Bob ($1.2M). Since we still have 8 rounds left for negotiation, I'll reject and make a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still maintain a strong position, aiming for a price that gives both parties a reasonable share of the value.

Round 4

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","This is a reasonable offer that gives me a good profit ($150K above my minimum) and is also fair to Bob (giving him $250K in value). While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing the deal, and $950K is a solid outcome.
