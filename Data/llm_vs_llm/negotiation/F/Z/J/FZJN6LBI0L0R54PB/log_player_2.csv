"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is close to my maximum budget of $1,200,000, but still below it, I'll try to negotiate a better price. I don't want to buy from John at $1,200,000 if I can get it cheaper from Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I don't know Alice's minimum acceptable price, I'll start with a price that is closer to what I think the product might be worth to her, which is $800,000.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,000,000 is a $100,000 reduction from her previous offer, which shows that she's willing to negotiate. However, I still think I can get a better deal.

Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'll try to negotiate further. I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 2, I offered $900,000, and Alice rejected it. Now, she's offering $1,000,000. To try to meet in the middle, I'll increase my offer, but not by too much. I'll add $50,000 to my previous offer, making it $950,000.
