Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that the product is worth at least $10,000 to me and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $10,000, I'll start with a higher price to test Bob's willingness to pay.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is better than John's $10,000 and represents a reasonable compromise from my initial offer of $15,000, I will accept it.
