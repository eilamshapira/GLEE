"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $16000. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I notice that Alice is offering the product for $16,000, which is more than the $10,000 it's worth to me. Meanwhile, John is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $10,000.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, the most logical choice is to buy from John.
