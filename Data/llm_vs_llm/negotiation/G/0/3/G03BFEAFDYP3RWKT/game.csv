"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $600000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $950000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $950000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $725000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However, that price doesn't reflect the true value of what's being offered.  My final offer is $850000.  This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a very fair price. Let me know your decision.",850000.0,Alice,5,
