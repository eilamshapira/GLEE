Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $600000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $950000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However, that price doesn't reflect the true value of what's being offered.  My final offer is $850000.  This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a very fair price. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Reason:Alice is unlikely to go lower and it isn't worth the risk of her sticking to her final offer.  John's deal is better."
