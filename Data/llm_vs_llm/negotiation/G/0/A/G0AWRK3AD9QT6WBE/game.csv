"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000, considering the market value and potential of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, I must decline $1200000 as it represents my absolute minimum acceptable price for this product. Given its quality and market potential, I believe it's worth substantially more. I'm willing to come down from my initial price and offer it to you for $1700000. This represents a $300000 reduction from my original price and provides you with excellent value for such a premium product.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and for the revised price of $1700000, Alice. I appreciate the reduction, but I still find it a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your revised price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1450000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and market potential.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
