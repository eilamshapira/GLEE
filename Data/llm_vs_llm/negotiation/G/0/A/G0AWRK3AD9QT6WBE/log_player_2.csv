Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, I must decline $1200000 as it represents my absolute minimum acceptable price for this product. Given its quality and market potential, I believe it's worth substantially more. I'm willing to come down from my initial price and offer it to you for $1700000. This represents a $300000 reduction from my original price and provides you with excellent value for such a premium product.
