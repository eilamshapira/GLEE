"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer of $95 is less than my maximum budget of $150, it's a good deal for me. I don't need to consider buying from John for $150, which is more expensive.
