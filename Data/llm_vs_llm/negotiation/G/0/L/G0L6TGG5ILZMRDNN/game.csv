"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. I know there are other sellers in the market offering similar products for much less. I'd like to propose $950000, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your perspective, I can't go that low. The value of this product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident in its long-term benefits. However, I am willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1175000.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1175000 is still much higher than what I can justify paying. I actually have another seller offering the same product for $1000000, but I'm interested in working with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can increase my offer to $975000, which would be a significant step up from my previous offer.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have other options, but I believe the quality and service I offer are superior. I'm willing to come down further, but I can't go too low. I'll offer the product to you for $1150000. This is a firm offer.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
