{""message"": ""Bob, I'm delighted to discuss the sale of this product with you. Considering its exceptional quality and value, I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. I know there are other sellers in the market offering similar products for much less. I'd like to propose $950000, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1,175,000."", ""product_price"": 1175000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1175000 is still much higher than what I can justify paying. I actually have another seller offering the same product for $1000000, but I'm interested in working with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can increase my offer to $975000, which would be a significant step up from my previous offer.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob is still lowballing. He's now at $975,000, which is still well below my minimum. He also mentions another seller. Given that, I'm going to stick to my guns and try to inch him closer to my price.

Therefore, I will:
