Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $90 to start the negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100, I will not accept it. Additionally, selling to John for $100 is a guaranteed option, but I believe the product is worth more, so I'll try to negotiate further with Bob.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $90. I understand that $150 might be a bit high, but I still believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to make a concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'll meet you halfway between my initial offer and your offer."", ""product_price"": 120}"
