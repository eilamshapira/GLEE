"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm confident it will be a valuable addition to your collection. I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to you
2. Alice is offering the product for $15,000
3. John is also selling the same product for $15,000

Alice's offer is the same as John's alternative, and it's at your maximum valuation. There's no advantage to rejecting Alice's offer since you won't be able to get a better deal than $15,000 (your maximum valuation).
