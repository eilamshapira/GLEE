"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me think about this. Alice's offer is $1,450,000, which is less than John's price of $1,500,000. However, I know the product is only worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so there's significant room for negotiation.

Since I have 10 rounds available and can always fall back on John's offer at any time, it makes sense to try negotiating with Alice for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her price from $1,450,000 to $1,400,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is still $100,000 less than John's price, but I believe we can get an even better deal. Since we have plenty of rounds left for negotiation, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer slightly to show I'm negotiating in good faith, but still try to get a good deal.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has come down again to $1,375,000, which is progress. She started at $1,450,000 and has now reduced her price by $75,000. This is $125,000 better than John's price of $1,500,000. However, since we still have 5 more rounds after this one and Alice seems to be moving in reasonable increments, I'll continue negotiating to try to get an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll continue the negotiation by increasing my offer again to show I'm willing to meet in the middle.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is getting closer to my last offer of $1,325,000. We're now $150,000 better than John's price, and the gap between our positions has narrowed to just $25,000. 

Since we're making good progress and we still have a few rounds left, I'll reject this offer and try one more time to meet in the middle.

Round 8

Given that we only have one round left after this one and we're very close to an agreement, I'll accept this offer rather than risk having to settle for a potentially worse deal in the final round.
