"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to offer you the product for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than my maximum budget of $1,500,000, and it's also closer to the product's value to Alice ($800,000) than John's offer, I will consider accepting the offer to save money compared to buying from John.
