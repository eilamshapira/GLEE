You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $13,000 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($12,000), but lower than my initial offer ($14,000), I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

My counteroffer will be $13,500.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} and my counteroffer is $13,500."

My decision is to make a new counteroffer: $13,250.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} and my counteroffer is $13,250."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob is still offering $13,000, which is lower than my previous counteroffer of $13,250. At this point, I'm starting to think that Bob may not be willing to budge much further.

However, since $13,000 is still higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($12,000), and I have a few more rounds to go, I'll try to make a small concession to see if I can get Bob to meet me at a higher price.

My decision is to make a new counteroffer: $13,100.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob is still offering $13,000, and I've made several concessions already. At this point, I think it's unlikely that Bob will offer more than $13,000.

Since $13,000 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($12,000), and I only have a few rounds left, I'm going to accept Bob's offer.

My decision is: {""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
