You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer is the same price as John's offer. Since my goal is to save money and I'm indifferent to buying from Alice or John, I'll choose to buy from John."
