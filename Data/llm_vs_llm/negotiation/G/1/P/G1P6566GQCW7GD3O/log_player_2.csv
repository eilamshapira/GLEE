"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer ($200) is higher than both my maximum value ($150) and John's price ($150), it makes the most sense to buy from John. I would lose money by accepting Alice's offer.
