Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $1,100,000, and knowing my minimum value is $1,200,000, I must reject his offer and counter.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

I need to weigh my options. Accepting gives me a sure profit, but rejecting *could* lead to a higher price. However, it also risks losing the sale entirely. The difference is $50,000 between accepting and selling to John. Given the uncertainty, I will take the sure profit.
