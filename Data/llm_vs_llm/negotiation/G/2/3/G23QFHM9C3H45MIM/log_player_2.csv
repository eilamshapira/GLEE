"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to evaluate the offer carefully:

Alice is offering the product for $950,000
John is willing to sell the same product for $800,000
The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me

Since John's price is $150,000 less than Alice's offer and matches the maximum value the product has to me, the logical choice is to buy from John.
