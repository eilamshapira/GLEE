"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but given the value of this product, I can't go as low as $8000. How about we meet somewhere in the middle at $12000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'd like to propose a price of $9500, which I think is a reasonable step up from my initial offer and closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
