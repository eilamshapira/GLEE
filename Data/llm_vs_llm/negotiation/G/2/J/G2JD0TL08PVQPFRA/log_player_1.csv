"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","$70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100, so I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer. Since Bob's offer was quite low, I'll reduce my initial price but still maintain a strong position.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial $180, but still maintain a good margin above my minimum of $100.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer of $80 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and with John's guaranteed offer of $100, there's no reason to accept this lower amount. Since Bob has only increased his offer by $10 (from $70 to $80), it seems he might not be willing to reach a price that would be acceptable to me. At this point, it would be wise to take the guaranteed offer from John.
