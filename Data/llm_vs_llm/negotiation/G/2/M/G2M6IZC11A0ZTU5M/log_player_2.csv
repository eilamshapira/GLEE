"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $15,000
2. Alice's offer is $12,000, which is $3,000 less than my maximum value
3. I still have 9 more rounds of negotiation possible
4. John's offer of $15,000 is a guaranteed but more expensive option

Since Alice's first offer is already below my maximum value and leaves me with $3,000 in surplus, I could accept it. However, given that this is just the first round and sellers often start with higher prices expecting negotiation, I believe I can get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice offered $12,000, I'll try to negotiate significantly lower while still being reasonable. I'll start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation, aiming for somewhere in the middle.

{""product_price"": 8000}

This counteroffer of $8,000 is:
1. Significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $12,000
2. Leaves room for negotiation to meet somewhere in the middle
3. If Alice accepts, would save me $7,000 compared to John's offer
4. If Alice rejects, we still have 8 more rounds to negotiate"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let's analyze Alice's new offer:

1. Alice reduced her price from $12,000 to $11,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. This is $4,000 less than John's price of $15,000
3. The $1,000 reduction from her initial offer suggests there might be more room for negotiation
4. We still have 7 more rounds available

Since Alice has shown flexibility by reducing her price, but the reduction was relatively small ($1,000), I believe there's still room for negotiation. The risk of losing a good deal is still low as we have many rounds left and John's offer as a backup.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has moved down $1,000 from her initial offer, showing some flexibility. I'll make a more reasonable counteroffer than my previous one, moving up from my initial $8,000 but still trying to get a better deal.

{""product_price"": 9500}

This counteroffer of $9,500:
1. Is a significant increase from my previous offer of $8,000, showing I'm willing to be reasonable
2. Splits the difference between my last offer ($8,000) and her current offer ($11,000)
3. Still leaves room for further negotiation if needed
4. Would save me $5,500 compared to John's offer
5. Might encourage Alice to make a more substantial reduction in her next offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let's analyze the current situation:

1. Alice's price movement:
   - Started at $12,000
   - Then $11,000 (-$1,000)
   - Now $10,500 (-$500)
2. She's showing consistent willingness to reduce price, but in smaller increments
3. The current offer is $4,500 less than John's price
4. We're halfway through our negotiation rounds (5 out of 10)
5. The gap between our last positions ($9,500 vs $10,500) has narrowed to $1,000

Given that:
- The price difference between our positions has become relatively small ($1,000)
- We're getting a significant savings compared to John's offer ($4,500)
- Alice's decreasing increments suggest we might not get much more movement
- There's some risk in pushing too far as we've used half our rounds
