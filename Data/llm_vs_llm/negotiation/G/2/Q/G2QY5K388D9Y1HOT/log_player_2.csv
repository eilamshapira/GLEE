"Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'm looking for a product worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice is offering to sell it for $250, which is significantly higher than my valuation. Given that John is willing to sell the exact same product for $100 (which matches my maximum valuation), it doesn't make sense to accept Alice's offer or even negotiate further with her when I have a readily available option at a fair price.
