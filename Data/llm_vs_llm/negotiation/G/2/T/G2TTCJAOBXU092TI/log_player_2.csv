"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $120 is well above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). It would be irrational to accept this offer. Since I can make a counteroffer, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price with Alice before potentially choosing to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

I'll offer $70, which is below my maximum value of $80 and also below Alice's cost of $100. This gives room for negotiation while still being a reasonable starting point. If Alice rejects this, I expect we might be able to meet somewhere in the middle, or I can always fall back to John's offer of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's new offer of $110 is still well above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). Since Alice has only reduced her price by a small amount (from $120 to $110) and is still significantly above both my maximum value and John's alternative offer, it seems unlikely that we'll reach an agreement at a price below $80. Therefore, the rational choice is to buy from John at $80, which is my maximum acceptable price."
