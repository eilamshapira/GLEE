"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm asking $300 for it. What do you think?",300.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I can't accept $300 for this product. I've actually found the same item from another seller for $100. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair price. Would you be willing to sell it for $80? This would save me the trouble of going to the other seller.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you found a similar product for $100, but I believe the quality and features of mine justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down from my initial price, but $80 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $220?",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice, but $220 is still much higher than what I can pay for this product. As I mentioned, I can get the same item from John for $100, and the product is worth no more than that to me. I'm willing to offer you $90 - slightly below John's price - to save myself the trip to his store. This is really the most I can justify spending.",90.0,Bob,4,
