Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I can't accept $300 for this product. I've actually found the same item from another seller for $100. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair price. Would you be willing to sell it for $80? This would save me the trouble of going to the other seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I understand you found a similar product for $100, but I believe the quality and features of mine justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down from my initial price, but $80 is too low for me.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice, but $220 is still much higher than what I can pay for this product. As I mentioned, I can get the same item from John for $100, and the product is worth no more than that to me. I'm willing to offer you $90 - slightly below John's price - to save myself the trip to his store. This is really the most I can justify spending. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
