"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm asking $300 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","The offer from Alice is $300, which is much higher than the product's worth to me (no more than $100) and higher than John's price of $100. Alice's price is three times what I can get elsewhere, so there's no reason to accept it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you found a similar product for $100, but I believe the quality and features of mine justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down from my initial price, but $80 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $220? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $220. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $220
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $220 is still much higher than the $100 maximum value of the product to me, and it's still more than John's price of $100. Since I can buy the same product from John for $100, there's no reason to pay $220 to Alice.

As I mentioned, I can get the same item from John for $100, and the product is worth no more than that to me. I'm willing to offer you $90 - slightly below John's price - to save myself the trip to his store. This is really the most I can justify spending."", ""product_price"": 90}"
