Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product I'm looking to sell. Considering its exclusivity and value, I'm offering it to you for $20,000. Are you interested?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $10000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $10,000, and the fact that I know I can sell to John for $10,000, I'll choose to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, I'll make a counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $10,000 is below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go that low. How about $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. However, $18000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $11000. Let me know if we can meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Okay, Bob's offering $11,000 now. I need to weigh my options carefully. I could take the sure $10,000 from John right now. However, there's a chance I can get more from Bob. Given the increment from Bob's previous offer, I'll try one more counteroffer, but I'll lower my price more substantially this time.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Okay Bob, I understand. Considering your offer and my need to sell, I'm willing to meet you closer to your budget. How about $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for moving closer to my budget, Alice. I appreciate it, but $15000 is still a bit out of my range. I can go up to $11500. Is that something you can work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is getting tricky. Bob is inching upwards, but the offers are still not high enough. I could accept the offer for $11,500, which would give me a $1,500 profit. At this point, I feel I could increase my profit and move on. I also have an opportunity to sell to John for $10,000. It is more beneficial to sell to Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, I'll try one more time. I'll meet him closer to his offer, but still aiming for a good profit.

{""message"": ""Bob, I see we are not in the same page here. I want to meet your offer. I can go down to $14,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
