"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I am considering Alice's offer of $14,999 for the product.

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me (Bob). Alice's offer of $14,999 exceeds the value I place on the product.

John is willing to sell me the same product for $12,000, which matches the maximum value I place on it.

Since Alice's offer exceeds the product's value to me, and I have a better alternative with John's offer, I should choose option 3.
