"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $10000 is significantly lower than my asking price. I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $18000, but it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer. However, $12000 is still below the minimum I can accept. I'm willing to lower my price to $15500 to meet you halfway. If this doesn't work for you, I understand that you'll need to explore other options.  This is my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
