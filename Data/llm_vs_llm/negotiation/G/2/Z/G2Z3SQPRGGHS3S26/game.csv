"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. Given its unique value and benefits, I'm initially pricing it at $25000. I believe it's a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. I'm thinking more in the range of $4000. How about we discuss this further?",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counter, Bob. $4000 is too low for me. I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but the value of this product is significantly higher. How about we meet in the middle a bit? My lowest price at this time is $22000.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Alice, but $22000 is still way too high for me. Let's try to find some more middle ground. How about $5000?",5000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're quite far apart. While I appreciate your offers, $5000 is still not enough for me to part with this product. I am willing to come down, but not that drastically. Let's try $20000.",20000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $20000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $6000. Let's keep trying to find a compromise.",6000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we have vastly different perceptions of the value of this product. I need to make sure I am not underselling. My next offer is $18000. It's the lowest I can go at this moment.",18000.0,Alice,7,
