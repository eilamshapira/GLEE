Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, but I'm afraid $5000000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, considering the product's worth. I'd like to propose a price that I believe is more reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the minimum value the product holds for me, and selling it to John would yield the same amount, I have nothing to lose by trying to negotiate further with Bob to see if he's willing to pay more.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the compromise you're willing to make. However, $3750000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to find a mutually agreeable price. I believe the product is valuable, but I need to be mindful of my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $1,200,000 is an increase from his previous offer, showing he's willing to negotiate and pay more for the product. However, it's still significantly lower than my initial valuation and even my last counteroffer. Since Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, it suggests he might be willing to pay more, but I need to balance pushing for a higher price with the risk of him walking away.

Given that selling to John would only yield $1,000,000, and Bob is now offering $1,200,000, I see an opportunity to potentially earn more by continuing negotiations.

I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid, and it shows me that you value the product. However, I still believe there's a gap between your offer and the product's true worth. Considering your latest increase, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and your current bid. Let's work together to find a price that reflects the product's value and your budget."", ""product_price"": 2480000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for meeting me halfway. I appreciate your willingness to work together to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $2480000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to increase my offer again, but I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. I believe we're getting close to a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $1,500,000 is a significant increase from his previous bids, indicating he's seriously interested in the product and willing to pay a substantial amount for it. This offer is also getting closer to what I might consider a reasonable price, given the product's value to me.

However, I still believe the product is worth more than $1,500,000. Since Bob is continually increasing his offer, it suggests he may have some flexibility in his budget. But, I also need to consider the risk of pushing him too far and losing the sale.

Given that Bob's offer is now $1,500,000, which is $500,000 more than what John is willing to pay, I think it's worth trying to negotiate a bit further to see if I can get an even better price.
