"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $12,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at $12,000, I'll start with a higher price to test Bob's willingness to pay.

{""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 (and even below his own valuation of $10,000), and I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $12,000, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still keep it above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, as I always have John's offer as a backup.

{""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and since I have a guaranteed offer from John at $12,000, there's no reason for me to accept an offer that would result in a $3,000 loss. Given that Bob's offers are still far from my minimum price and we've already gone through 4 rounds with little progress, I'll choose to sell to John.
