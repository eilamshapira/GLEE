Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice's offer is too high.  It's much better to start negotiating and see if she's willing to come down significantly.  We can always buy from John for $10,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

We're starting with a low offer to see how much Alice is willing to budge. This is a common negotiation tactic to understand the other party's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

```

While Alice came down slightly, her offer is still too far from our ideal price. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

We're moving up a bit from our initial offer, but still staying well below Alice's last price. This shows her we're willing to negotiate but also that we're serious about getting a good deal."
