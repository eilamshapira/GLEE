"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given that Alice is offering the product for $200, which is more than the value of the product to me ($120) and more than John's price ($120), I should not accept this offer.

Since John is willing to sell the product for $120, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I have no reason to negotiate with Alice for a higher price.
