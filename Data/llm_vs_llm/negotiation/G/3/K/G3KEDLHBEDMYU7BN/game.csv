"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $120 is below what I can accept given the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $150? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $150 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $135.  Let's see if we can make this work.",135.0,Bob,4,
