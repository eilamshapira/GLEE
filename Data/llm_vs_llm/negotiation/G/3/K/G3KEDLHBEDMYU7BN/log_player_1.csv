"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I have a great product to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $120?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. While $120 matches John's price, I believe we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $120 is below what I can accept given the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $150? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $150 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $135.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $135. This is a fair price that's better than John's $120 offer, and we've reached a reasonable middle ground after negotiation."
