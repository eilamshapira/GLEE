Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic offer to Bob that maximizes my profit while still being attractive enough for him to accept.

The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, which is his maximum valuation.
The product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at exactly that price.

If I price too high, Bob might reject the offer and I'll end up with $1,200,000 from John.
If I price too low, I'll leave money on the table.

The optimal approach is to offer a price that gives Bob some value (so he accepts) while capturing most of the surplus value.

A reasonable price would be $1,400,000. This:
- Is $100,000 below Bob's valuation, giving him incentive to accept
- Is $200,000 above my guaranteed alternative with John
- Captures 2/3 of the potential surplus in the transaction
