"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Let me know if we can meet at that price.",80.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. However, $80 is below my minimum price. I can go down to $120, which is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about we settle at $110? This is a good compromise and still a great deal for you.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your new price. How about $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I can see you're trying to meet in the middle, but $95 is still below my minimum. How about we settle at $105? This is very close to your offer and still within a reasonable range for both of us.",105.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're close to reaching an agreement. How about we meet at $102? This is a small step down from my last offer and should be within your budget while still being fair to me.",102.0,Alice,5,
