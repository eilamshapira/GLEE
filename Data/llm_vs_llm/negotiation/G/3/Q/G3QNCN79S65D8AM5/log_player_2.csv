"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $110, which I think is a fair price considering its quality and value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I should carefully consider Alice's offer. She's asking for $110 for a product that's worth $80 to her. Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, her offer is within my acceptable range, but I can probably negotiate a better deal and save some money.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, as this would allow me to potentially get the product for less than $110. John's price ($120) is still my fallback option if negotiations fail.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it, which I believe is fair considering market alternatives. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $90 is too low for this product's value. I can offer it to you for $100, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has reduced her price from $110 to $100, which is a good improvement. The product is worth $80 to her, so she's still making a profit, but $100 is certainly better than the $120 I'd have to pay John. Since we have plenty of rounds left and Alice has already shown willingness to negotiate, I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate that. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair deal for both of us, and I'm ready to complete the purchase at that price."", ""product_price"": 95}"
