Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make an offer to Bob that maximizes my profit, knowing that I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000.

{""product_price"": 1,350,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000) and even below what the product is worth to him ($800,000). This is a very low opening counteroffer from Bob.

Since I have John willing to pay $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable value, there's no reason for me to accept Bob's low offer. I could make a counteroffer, but given the large gap between our positions and the guaranteed alternative with John, the most rational decision is:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
