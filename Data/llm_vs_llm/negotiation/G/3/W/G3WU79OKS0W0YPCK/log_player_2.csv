"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since the offered price of $1,350,000 is above my maximum budget of $800,000, it doesn't make sense to accept this offer. Additionally, buying from John for $800,000 is within my budget, but I want to try to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price that is lower than $800,000 or at least closer to it than $1,350,000. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is reasonable and within my budget. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a lower offer and see how Alice responds.
