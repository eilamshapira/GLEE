"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'll analyze the situation carefully. Alice is offering me the product for $900,000, but the product is only worth $800,000 to me, so accepting this offer would mean losing $100,000 in value. 

I also know that John is willing to sell me the same product for $800,000, which exactly matches my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's current offer exceeds my maximum valuation, and is higher than John's price, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This gives me an opportunity to potentially get a better deal than John's $800,000 offer, which I can always fall back on.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice that gives us both room to negotiate while still being advantageous to me.

{""product_price"": $700,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her offer from $900,000 to $850,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this price is still $50,000 more than what John is offering ($800,000), and still exceeds my maximum valuation.

Since John's offer of $800,000 exactly matches my maximum valuation, and Alice's current offer is still higher than that, it makes sense to reject and continue negotiating. I still have several rounds left to try to get a better deal from Alice before potentially falling back on John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll adjust my counteroffer to move closer to Alice while still trying to secure a better deal than John's offer.

{""product_price"": $750,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $840,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $840,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has now reduced her offer to $840,000, which is still $40,000 more than what John is offering and exceeds my maximum valuation of $800,000. She's making small concessions ($10,000 this time), which suggests she may continue to reduce her price if I keep negotiating.

Since John's offer of $800,000 is still better than Alice's current offer, and I still have several rounds left to negotiate, it makes sense to reject and continue trying to get a better deal from Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll continue moving toward a middle ground while ensuring I get a better deal than John's offer.

{""product_price"": $775,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $830,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $830,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has now reduced her offer to $830,000, which is still $30,000 more than John's offer and above my maximum valuation. While she's continuing to make concessions, she's only moving by $10,000 each time, which suggests we may not reach a price below $800,000 in the remaining rounds.

Since John's offer of $800,000 is still better than Alice's current offer, and I now have fewer rounds remaining, I need to consider my options carefully. At this point, I'll make one more attempt at negotiation with Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a more significant move toward Alice's position to signal that I'm serious about reaching a deal, while still ensuring it's beneficial for me compared to John's offer.
