"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm very interested in the product, $11500 is quite steep. Given market conditions, I'd be willing to pay $10500 for it. This represents a fair price that would be beneficial for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $10500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11250?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $11250 is still higher than what I was hoping to pay. I can increase my offer to $10800. This is a fair price that gives you a good profit margin while being more aligned with my budget.",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $10800 is close, but I'm still a little hesitant to go that low. Tell you what, let's try $11100. It is only a bit higher, and I think it reflects the true value of the product for you.",11100.0,Alice,5,
