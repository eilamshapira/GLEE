"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and the significant benefit it will bring to you, I'm offering it to you for $1450000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to carefully consider this offer:

1. Alice is offering the product for $1,450,000
2. The product is worth at most $1,000,000 to me
3. John offers the same product for $1,000,000
4. Alice's price is $450,000 more than John's price and more than what the product is worth to me

Since Alice's price is significantly higher than both the product's value to me and John's alternative offer, the rational decision is to buy from John.
