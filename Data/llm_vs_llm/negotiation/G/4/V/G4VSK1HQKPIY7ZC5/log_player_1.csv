"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $40. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $40
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $40 is significantly lower than my initial offer and also lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($100), I will not accept it. Additionally, selling to John for $100 is a guaranteed option that is closer to my minimum value, but I still want to try to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a higher price.

Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

My counteroffer to Bob is $120."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's new offer of $60 is still lower than my desired price, but it's higher than his previous offer, indicating some willingness to negotiate. However, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.

Given that selling to John for $100 is a guaranteed option and Bob's offer is $40 less than that, I will reject Bob's offer again. I could try to make another counteroffer, but since Bob's increase from $40 to $60 is modest and still far from my target, I'm inclined to consider the guaranteed sale to John more seriously.

However, I'll make one more attempt to negotiate with Bob to see if he can meet me closer to my minimum value.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

My counteroffer to Bob is $110."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer has increased again, but it's still $30 less than the guaranteed price I can get from John. At this point, Bob's offers have been increasing, but very slowly, and we're still quite far from my minimum acceptable price.

Considering the negotiation process and the fact that Bob's latest offer of $70 is still significantly lower than what I can get from John, I think it's time to prioritize the guaranteed sale.
