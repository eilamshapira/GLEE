"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","The offer of $110 is high considering Alice's cost is $80, but it's still better than John's price of $120. However, since there's room for negotiation and the product is worth up to $120 for me, I should try to get a better deal from Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably above Alice's cost ($80) but significantly lower than her initial offer ($110). This gives room for negotiation while still allowing Alice to make a profit.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has come down from $110 to $100, which is a good improvement. While I might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice could increase the price again or become unwilling to negotiate. $100 is a reasonable price that gives Alice a fair profit while being significantly better than John's price of $120. I'll accept this offer.
