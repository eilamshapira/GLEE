"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $5000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $5,000 because it's significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a more reasonable offer. I'll proceed to the next round to send a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but $5,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to consider a lower price, but I need to feel that it's a fair deal. I'm thinking more along the lines of $18,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $6000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. Let me know if this is something you can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $6,000 because it's still far below the minimum value I have for the product, which is $15,000. Although Bob has increased his offer, it's not enough to make it a viable option for me. I'll proceed to the next round to send a counteroffer, hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $6,000. However, I still need to see a more significant movement towards a price that I'm comfortable with. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway between my last offer and your current offer. How about $12,000? This is a substantial concession on my part, and I hope you can consider it."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $12000. I understand it's a big concession, but it's still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7000. This is the highest I can go at the moment. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $7,000 because it's still significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $15,000. Although Bob has increased his offer again, it's not enough to bridge the gap. I'll proceed to the next round to send a counteroffer, but I'm starting to consider selling to John for $15,000 as a more viable option if Bob's offers don't improve substantially."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your latest offer of $7,000, but as I mentioned earlier, it's still not close to what I'm looking for. I'm starting to think that we might not be able to reach a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm willing to give it one more try. I can offer you a price of $10,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to another buyer who has already offered me $15,000."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
