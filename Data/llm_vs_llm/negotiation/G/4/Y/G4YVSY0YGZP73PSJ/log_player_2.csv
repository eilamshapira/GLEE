Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your latest offer of $7000, but as I mentioned earlier, it's still not close to what I'm looking for.

I can offer you a price of $10000, which is a significant compromise on my part. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to another buyer who has already offered me $15000.
