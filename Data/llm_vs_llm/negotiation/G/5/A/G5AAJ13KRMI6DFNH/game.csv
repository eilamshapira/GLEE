"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I'm offering to you. Given its quality and features, I'm setting the price at $12500. This represents excellent value considering the product's capabilities and market position. Would you like to purchase it at this price?",12500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $12500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8500 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your offer. While I understand budget constraints, $8500 is too close to my minimum threshold. The product's quality and value in the market justify a higher price. I can come down to $11200, which represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value. Would this work for you?",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $11200 is still outside of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $9500, but I can't go any higher. If you're open to this, I'm ready to make a deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $9500. We're making progress, but I still can't go that low given the product's value. I can reduce my price to $10300, which is significantly below my initial offer and represents excellent value. This is much closer to your range while still allowing me to receive fair compensation for the product. Can we agree on this price?",10300.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $10300 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $9900.  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",9900.0,Bob,6,
