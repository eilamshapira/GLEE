Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your offer. While I understand budget constraints, $8500 is too close to my minimum threshold. The product's quality and value in the market justify a higher price. I can come down to $11200, which represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value. Would this work for you?
