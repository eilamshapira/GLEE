"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer is $10,000, which is the same price as John's offer, and it's the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I should reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price with Alice. If the negotiation fails, I can always go back to John's offer later.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low that it would be considered unreasonable. Since the maximum value to me is $10,000, I'll start with an offer of $6,000, which leaves room for negotiation while potentially saving me a significant amount.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her price from $10,000 to $9,000, which is a good improvement and shows she's willing to negotiate. However, since she came down significantly from her initial offer, there might still be room for further negotiation. I'll reject this offer and try another counteroffer, knowing I can still fall back on either Alice's $9,000 or John's $10,000 if needed.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down from $10,000 to $9,000, showing willingness to negotiate, and she rejected my initial $6,000 offer, I'll make a more reasonable counteroffer. I'll try $7,500, which splits the difference between my last offer ($6,000) and her current offer ($9,000).

{""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has come down again to $8,500, which is a good sign. She's made multiple reductions from $10,000 → $9,000 → $8,500, showing she's willing to negotiate but in smaller increments now. While I could try another counteroffer, there's a risk that Alice might become frustrated and stop negotiating, which would leave me with John's $10,000 option. Given that I've already secured a $1,500 savings compared to John's price, I'll accept this offer.
