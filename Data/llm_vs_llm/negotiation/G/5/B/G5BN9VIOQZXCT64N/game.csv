"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested in the product,  $95 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to make an offer. I understand that $95 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm not comfortable selling it for $85. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again - how about $87.50?  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.",87.5,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm not quite ready to sell at $87.50, but I'm getting closer. How about we settle at $88.50? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",88.5,Alice,5,
