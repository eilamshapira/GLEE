Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer, but leave some room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","This is a good offer from Bob. At $1,200,000, it's significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and while it's lower than my initial offer, it still represents a very good profit. While I could counter-offer, there's a risk of Bob walking away, and the difference between this offer and my initial ask isn't large enough to risk losing the deal.
