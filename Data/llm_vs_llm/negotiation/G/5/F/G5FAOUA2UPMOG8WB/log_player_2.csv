"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $14999. This is a great opportunity to acquire something that is truly worth a lot. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision that maximizes my utility.

The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, but Alice is offering it for $14,999, which is significantly above my valuation.

Meanwhile, John is willing to sell the same product for $8,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

It wouldn't make financial sense to accept Alice's offer when I can get the same product from John at a much lower price that aligns with my valuation.
