"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I should consider my options carefully. Alice is offering the product for $95, which is less than the $100 maximum I'm willing to pay and less than John's fixed price of $100. However, I could potentially negotiate a better price with Alice since the product is worth $80 to her.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives us both some value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has come down to $90 from her initial offer of $95, which is a good sign. This is already better than John's price of $100, and getting closer to Alice's cost of $80. While I could try to negotiate further, $90 seems like a fair price that gives us both value.
