"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $110 is above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). It's better to reject and make a counteroffer, as there's potential to negotiate with Alice for a better price. If negotiations don't work out, I can always fall back on John's offer of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $70. This is below my maximum value of $80 and gives room for negotiation. Since Alice values the product at $100, there might be a possibility to reach a mutually beneficial agreement between $70 and $80. If Alice doesn't accept and we can't reach an agreement below $80, I can always buy from John at $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer of $90 is still above my maximum value of $80, and John is offering the product at exactly $80, it's best to buy from John. Alice has lowered her price but it's still not competitive with John's offer, and there's no guarantee further negotiation will result in a price below $80. Taking John's offer is the rational choice as it meets my maximum price point."
