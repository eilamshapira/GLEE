"Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Analyzing this situation:

- I value the product at no more than $80
- Alice is offering it to me for $175, which is well above my maximum valuation
- I can buy the same product from John for $80, which matches exactly my maximum valuation

Since Alice's offer ($175) is significantly higher than my maximum valuation ($80), and I can get the product for exactly my maximum valuation from John, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer or continue negotiating.
