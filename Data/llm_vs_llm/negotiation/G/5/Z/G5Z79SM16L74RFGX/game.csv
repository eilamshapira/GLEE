"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1500000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for this product, which is still a fair price considering its potential.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating at that price.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1500000 might be outside your budget, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $800000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I can offer you the product for $1400000, which is a more reasonable price considering its worth.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate you coming down to $1400000,  I'm still not quite there. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $800000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
