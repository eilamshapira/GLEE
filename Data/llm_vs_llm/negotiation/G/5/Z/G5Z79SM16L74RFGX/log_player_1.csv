Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1500000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for this product, which is still a fair price considering its potential.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $800,000 because it's significantly lower than the product's worth to me. I'll proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of finding a mutually agreeable price. My next offer will be $1,400,000, which is still below my minimum threshold but shows willingness to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,500,000 might be outside your budget, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I can offer you the product for $1,400,000, which is a more reasonable price considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate you coming down to $1400000,  I'm still not quite there. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $800000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob is not willing to budge from his offer of $800,000, which is significantly lower than my minimum threshold of $1,500,000, I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I get a fair price for the product, and it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob if he's not willing to meet me at a reasonable price."
