"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $15,000
3. John is willing to sell it for $12,000

The logical choice would be to buy from John since:
- Alice's price ($15,000) is above my maximum value ($12,000)
- John's price ($12,000) matches my maximum value
- I would be overpaying by $3,000 if I accepted Alice's offer
