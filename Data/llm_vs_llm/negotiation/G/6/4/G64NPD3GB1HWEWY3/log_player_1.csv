Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a price that maximizes my expected profit from selling the product to Bob, while knowing I have a fallback option of selling to John for $8,000.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll need to make an educated guess. If I set the price too high, Bob might reject it, and I'll end up with $8,000 from John. If I set it too low, Bob will accept, but I'll miss out on potential profit.

A reasonable approach is to offer a price that's noticeably higher than my fallback option, but not so high that it's likely to be rejected. I'll aim for $10,000, which gives me a 25% premium over my fallback option.
