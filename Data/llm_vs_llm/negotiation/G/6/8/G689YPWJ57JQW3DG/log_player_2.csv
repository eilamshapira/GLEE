Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer is $2,000,000, which is much higher than my target price of $800,000, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower, but still shows that I'm interested in the product.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand that the product has unique qualities, but I was thinking more along the lines of $400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I expect to get from the product."", ""product_price"": 400000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your perspective, Bob. However, given the market potential and the intrinsic value of the product, I must stick closer to my valuation. I'm willing to offer a better deal for you at $1800000. I hope this price is more in line with our mutual interests.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice reduced the price from $2,000,000 to $1,800,000, which is a step in the right direction. However, it's still far from my target price. I'll try to meet her halfway between my previous offer and her new offer.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering your price of $1,800,000 and my previous offer of $400,000, I'd like to propose a middle ground at $1,100,000.
