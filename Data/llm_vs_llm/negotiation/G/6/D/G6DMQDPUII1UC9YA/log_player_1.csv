"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a relatively high price to maximize my potential earnings. However, I'll also keep in mind that the price should be reasonable enough for Bob to consider making a counteroffer.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is lower than the minimum value of $10,000 that the product is worth to me, I will reject his offer. Additionally, selling to John for $10,000 is a better option than accepting Bob's offer, but I still want to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $8,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial offer of $20,000, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'll try to meet him halfway and see if we can find a mutually acceptable price.

{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is equal to the minimum value that the product is worth to me, and it's also the same price that John is willing to pay, I have to consider whether it's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob or just selling to John.

However, since I've already invested time and effort into negotiating with Bob, and we're only at Round 4, I'll give him one more chance to increase his offer. If he's willing to pay $10,000, maybe he's willing to pay a bit more.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $10,000, which is the minimum value I'm willing to accept, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher. I'll try to nudge him up to see if he's willing to pay a premium.
