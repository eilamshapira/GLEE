"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and I have John's offer as a backup, I'll start with a low counteroffer to try to get a better deal than John's price.

{""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice has dropped her price significantly from $20,000 to $15,000, this shows she has room to negotiate, but $15,000 is still higher than John's price of $12,000. I'll continue negotiating to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $20,000 to $15,000, showing significant flexibility, I'll increase my previous offer but still stay below John's price to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has now matched John's price of $12,000. Since this is the same as my alternative option with John, and since we know the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, it makes sense to accept this offer. There's no guarantee we could negotiate a better price, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
