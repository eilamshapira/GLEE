"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it for $1200000. Please let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000), it would not be rational to accept her offer. John's offer is equal to my maximum value, and it's $400,000 less than Alice's price.
