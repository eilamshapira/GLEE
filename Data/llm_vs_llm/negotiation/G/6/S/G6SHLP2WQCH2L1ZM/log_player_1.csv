"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, Bob, let's get started. Given that I can always fall back on selling to John for $1,200,000, and I don't know your valuation, I'm going to start high to see what your interest level is. Here's my initial offer:

```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","That's quite a lowball offer from Bob! It's well below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Selling to John is my baseline, and $900,000 is not even close.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, Bob, let's try to find some common ground. Your initial offer was quite low, so I'm going to come down a bit, but not that much. I still believe this product is worth a premium.

{""product_price"": 1700000}
```"

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob is still far too low. $950,000 is unacceptable. My floor is $1,200,000, and he's not even close. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating, hoping he'll get more serious.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, Bob, this is getting to be a waste of time. I'm going to make a more significant drop, but this is getting closer to my bottom line.
