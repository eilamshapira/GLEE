"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. I can offer it to you for $135, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with at this point.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $135 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $120? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
