"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($12,000), I will reject her offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm willing to pay up to $12,000, I'll start by offering a lower price and see how Alice responds.

{""product_price"": $8,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $18,000 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. Since she rejected my previous counteroffer of $8,000, I'll try to meet her halfway and make another counteroffer.

However, for now, I'll reject her offer and consider making another counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer decreased from $20,000 to $18,000, it shows that she's willing to negotiate. My previous offer of $8,000 was rejected, so I'll increase it to $10,000, which is still below my maximum budget of $12,000.

{""product_price"": $10,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $16,000 is still higher than I'm willing to pay, but it's getting closer to my budget. However, it's still $4,000 above my maximum budget of $12,000.

At this point, I think it's better to reject Alice's offer again and try to make another counteroffer. Since Alice has been decreasing her price, I'm hoping she'll continue to do so.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer decreased from $18,000 to $16,000, it shows that she's willing to continue negotiating. My previous offer of $10,000 was rejected, so I'll increase it to $11,000, which is still below my maximum budget of $12,000. This is a relatively small increase, hoping that Alice will see that I'm willing to meet her halfway.

{""product_price"": $11,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $14,500 is still higher than I'm willing to pay, and it's getting closer to the point where I might as well buy from John for $12,000.

At this point, I'm starting to think that Alice might not be willing to go as low as I want, and I'm running out of time (only 3 rounds left). Since $14,500 is still $2,500 above my maximum budget, I think it's time to consider buying from John.
