Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my offer to Bob. The product is worth $120 to Bob and $100 to me (my minimum acceptable price). If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell it to John for exactly $100.

Since Bob values the product at $120, any price below that should theoretically give him positive value from the transaction. However, if I price it too high, he might reject it. I want to offer a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept while maximizing my profit.
