Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I think $115 is a bit high. Given that I know the product's value to you is $100, I believe a fair price would be $107. This gives you a good profit margin while also being more reasonable for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
