"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I'm definitely interested in the product, $14000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $11000.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand budget constraints, I need to consider the product's value. I can come down from my initial offer, but $11000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price. I could sell it to you for $13000, which I believe is fair considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  $13000 is still a little more than I'd hoped to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $12000? I feel that's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
