Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand budget constraints, I need to consider the product's value. I can come down from my initial offer, but $11000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price. I could sell it to you for $13000, which I believe is fair considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?
