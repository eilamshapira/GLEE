"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find $1250000 to be quite high for this product. Given market conditions and comparable alternatives, I'd be willing to purchase it for $950000. This is a fair price that would benefit both of us, as I know there are similar products available in the market for around $1000000.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $950000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's unique features and its value to me, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
