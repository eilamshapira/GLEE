"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find $1250000 to be quite high for this product. Given market conditions and comparable alternatives, I'd be willing to purchase it for $950000. This is a fair price that would benefit both of us, as I know there are similar products available in the market for around $1000000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $950,000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go.
