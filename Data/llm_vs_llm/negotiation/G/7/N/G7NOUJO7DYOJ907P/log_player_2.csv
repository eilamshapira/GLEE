"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be a valuable addition to your collection. After careful consideration, I'm willing to let it go for a price that I think is fair and reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price offered by Alice ($1,250,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000). It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer, keeping in mind that I always have the option to buy from John at $1,000,000 if negotiations with Alice don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find $1,250,000 to be quite high for this product. Given market conditions and comparable alternatives, I'd be willing to purchase it for $950,000. This is a fair price that would benefit both of us, as I know there are similar products available in the market for around $1,000,000."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $950000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's unique features and its value to me, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's new offer of $1,200,000 is still above both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000). Since Alice suggests this is the lowest price she's comfortable with, and it's still significantly higher than my alternative option, it makes the most sense to buy from John at $1,000,000. This way, I get the product at a price that's within my budget and matches my maximum valuation."
