"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly lower than your asking price but still leaves room for you to make a profit.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, after considering your offer and John's offer, I'm willing to lower my price. How about we settle on $1000000. This is a fair middle ground for both of us, and it's still significantly lower than my initial asking price. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
