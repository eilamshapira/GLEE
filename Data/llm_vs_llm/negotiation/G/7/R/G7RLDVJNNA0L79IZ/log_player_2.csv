It's better to try and negotiate with Alice.  You can likely get a lower price than $1,100,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after considering your offer and John's offer, I'm willing to lower my price. How about we settle on $1000000. This is a fair middle ground for both of us, and it's still significantly lower than my initial asking price. What do you think?

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is a good deal.  It's significantly lower than John's price, and you're still getting a good product."
