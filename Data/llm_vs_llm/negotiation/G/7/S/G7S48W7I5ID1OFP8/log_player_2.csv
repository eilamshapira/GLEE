(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $11,500 is close to my maximum budget of $12,000, but I still have room to negotiate and potentially save some money, I will choose to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since Alice's worth for the product is $8,000, I'll start by offering a price that is slightly higher than that, to leave room for further negotiation.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $10,500 is lower than her initial offer, which is a good sign. However, I still think I can get a better deal. Since I know Alice's worth for the product is $8,000, I'm willing to continue negotiating to try to get closer to that price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 2, I offered $8,500, which was rejected by Alice. Now, Alice has come down to $10,500. To try to meet in the middle and make progress, I'll increase my offer slightly, but still keep it below Alice's current offer.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $9,750 is getting closer to my target price range. Considering that Alice's worth for the product is $8,000, I'm starting to feel that we're nearing a mutually beneficial price. However, I still think I can get a slightly better deal.

Since I've already offered $9,000 in Round 4, I don't want to increase my offer too much. I'll reject Alice's current offer and try to make a small concession to see if Alice will meet me in the middle.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 4, I offered $9,000, and now Alice has come down to $9,750. To try to meet in the middle, I'll increase my offer by a small amount, hoping to find a mutually acceptable price.
