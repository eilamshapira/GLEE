"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, I can only pay $120 for it. This is a fair price considering I have another option to buy the same product from John for $150. I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
