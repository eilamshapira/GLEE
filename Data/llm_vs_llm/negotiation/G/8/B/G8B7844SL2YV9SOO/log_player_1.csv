Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a top-quality product for $200. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, I can only pay $120 for it. This is a fair price considering I have another option to buy the same product from John for $150. I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
