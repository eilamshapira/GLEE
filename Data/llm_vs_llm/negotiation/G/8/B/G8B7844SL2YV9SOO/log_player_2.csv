"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a top-quality product for $200. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider my options carefully here. Alice is offering the product for $200, which is more than the $150 it's worth to me. Since John is willing to sell me the exact same product for $150, which is the maximum I value it at, there's no reason for me to pay more than that to Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, I can only pay $120 for it. This is a fair price considering I have another option to buy the same product from John for $150. I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}"
