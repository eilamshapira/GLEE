"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $250 is quite high for my budget. I know I can purchase this same product from another seller for $120. However, I'd be happy to buy it from you instead if you can offer a better price. Would you consider $100 for the product?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you considering it. While I can't go down to $100, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $220?",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $220 is still quite a bit more than I can pay. I can get the identical product from John for $120, so there's no reason for me to pay more than that. To make it worth dealing with you instead, I'd be willing to offer $110. This gives you a quick sale and saves me a bit compared to my alternative option.",110.0,Bob,4,
