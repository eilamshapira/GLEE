Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'll be interested in. How about I offer it to you for $250?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $250 is quite high for my budget. I know I can purchase this same product from another seller for $120. However, I'd be happy to buy it from you instead if you can offer a better price. Would you consider $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","This is tricky! Bob's message seems to suggest he values the product *around* $120 (based on what he can get it for elsewhere). However, he's lowballing me with $100. I need to decide quickly.

Given my minimum acceptable price is $150 (selling to John), and knowing Bob's offer is $100:

I will reject Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you considering it. While I can't go down to $100, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $220?"", ""product_price"": 220}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $220 is still quite a bit more than I can pay. I can get the identical product from John for $120, so there's no reason for me to pay more than that. To make it worth dealing with you instead, I'd be willing to offer $110. This gives you a quick sale and saves me a bit compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's message is a bit frustrating, but I need to make a decision. He's clearly trying to get a deal, and is still referencing a $120 price point. While I *could* try to squeeze more out of him, I'm at risk of losing the sale altogether. Also, I know I can get $150 from John.

Selling to John for $150 seems the safest and most profitable option at this point.
