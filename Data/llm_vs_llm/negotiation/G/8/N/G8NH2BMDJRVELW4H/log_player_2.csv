# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'll be interested in. How about I offer it to you for $250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","The offer from Alice is $250, which is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $120, and it's also more than what John is offering. Since I can get the same product from John for $120, it doesn't make sense to accept Alice's offer of $250.

# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you considering it. While I can't go down to $100, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $220?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has reduced her price to $220, but that's still $100 more than what John is offering ($120). Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible while getting the product, and the product is only worth up to $120 to me, it still makes more sense to reject Alice's offer.

I can get the identical product from John for $120, so there's no reason for me to pay more than that. To make it worth dealing with you instead, I'd be willing to offer $110. This gives you a quick sale and saves me a bit compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 110}"
