Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that the product is worth at least $150 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $150, I should not accept any offer below $150 from Bob. Since Bob values the product at only $80, he is very unlikely to accept a price of $150 or higher. However, I'll start with a high offer to leave room for negotiation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Given that:
1. The product is worth at least $150 to me
2. Bob's offer of $60 is far below my minimum acceptable price
3. I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $150
4. Bob values the product at only $80, so he won't likely ever offer more than that

There's no point in continuing negotiations with Bob since his maximum valuation ($80) is well below my minimum acceptable price ($150). The best decision is to sell to John.
