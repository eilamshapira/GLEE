"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you've highlighted, but I believe there's room for further negotiation. Considering the product's worth to you is $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between your valuation and my maximum budget. I'd like to propose a price of $1000000, which still allows me to realize a gain while being more in line with the product's value to both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter offer. I appreciate your perspective, but I need to be closer to the product's true market value. While my initial offer was $1050000, I'm willing to come down to $1030000. This still provides you with a significant $170000 in value on a product worth $1200000 to you. This represents a fair deal for both of us, as I'm moving substantially from my initial position while ensuring you still receive excellent value.",1030000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for revising your offer. I appreciate the effort to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I still believe we can find a better middle ground. Given that you've come down from $1050000 to $1030000, I'm willing to increase my previous offer. I propose a price of $1010000, which is closer to your revised offer while still allowing me to realize a reasonable gain. I hope this counteroffer is more acceptable to you.",1010000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your increased offer. We're getting closer to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you partway and reduce my price to $1020000. This represents my final offer and is a fair compromise between our positions. At this price, you'll still realize a substantial $180000 in value from a product worth $1200000 to you. I believe this represents an equitable outcome for both of us, as I've now reduced my initial asking price by $30000.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
