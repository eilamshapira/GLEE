Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counter offer. I appreciate your perspective, but I need to be closer to the product's true market value. While my initial offer was $1050000, I'm willing to come down to $1030000. This still provides you with a significant $170000 in value on a product worth $1200000 to you. This represents a fair deal for both of us, as I'm moving substantially from my initial position while ensuring you still receive excellent value.
