"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000
2. John is also selling it for $1,200,000
3. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice
4. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me

Since Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's price ($1,200,000), and this is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I should reject Alice's offer to try to negotiate a better price. Alice has room to lower the price since the product is worth $1,000,000 to her, so she could potentially offer a better deal.
