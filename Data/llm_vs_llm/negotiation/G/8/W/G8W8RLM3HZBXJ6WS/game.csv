"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product sounds interesting, $12500 is a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm looking to spend closer to $10000. Would you consider an offer of $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to spend around $10000, but I need to consider the true value of this product. I can come down from my initial price, but $10000 is still lower than I can accept. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500. This is a competitive price considering the product's quality and features. Does this work for you?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $11500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. My budget is pretty firm at $10500. Could you meet me in the middle?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $10500. We're getting closer, but I still need to ensure I'm getting fair value for this product. I can come down to $11000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise between our positions. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents excellent value for the quality you'll receive. Can we agree on $11000?",11000.0,Alice,5,
