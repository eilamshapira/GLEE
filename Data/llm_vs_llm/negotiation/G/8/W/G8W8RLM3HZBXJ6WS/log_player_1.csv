Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product sounds interesting, $12500 is a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm looking to spend closer to $10000. Would you consider an offer of $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to spend around $10,000, but I need to consider the true value of this product.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $10,500. We're getting closer, but I still need to ensure I'm getting fair value for this product.

This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents excellent value for the quality you'll receive. Can we agree on $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
