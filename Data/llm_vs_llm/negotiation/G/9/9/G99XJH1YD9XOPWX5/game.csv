"Hi Alice, while I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, the price you've offered is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in acquiring it, but my budget is much lower. How about we settle on $600000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but your offer is too low. Considering the product's exceptional value, I'm willing to make a concession and lower the price. However, $600000 is not acceptable. I can offer it to you for $2200000, which is still a good deal for you.",2200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the new offer, but it's still beyond my budget. I understand the value you place on the product, but I need to stay within my financial limits. Could we meet in the middle? How about $700000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $700000 is still too low. I'm willing to make another concession, considering your interest in the product. I can offer it to you for $2000000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with at this point.",2000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $2000000 is still out of my budget. I'm trying to find a fair middle ground. How about we try $750000? This is the highest I can go while still staying within my financial limits.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $750000 is still too low. I'm willing to make another concession, considering your interest in the product. However, I need to ensure that I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $1800000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price.",1800000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1800000 is still too high for me. I'm trying to reach a compromise that works for both of us. How about we settle on $775000? This is really the top of my budget.",775000.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, but $775000 is still too low. I'm willing to make another concession, considering your interest in the product. However, I need to ensure that I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $1700000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options.",1700000.0,Alice,9,

"Hi Alice, I understand this is our final round, and I really want to make this work. Given that $1700000 is still beyond my budget, I'm willing to stretch a bit more. How about we finalize the deal at $790000? This is absolutely the highest I can go.",790000.0,Bob,10,
