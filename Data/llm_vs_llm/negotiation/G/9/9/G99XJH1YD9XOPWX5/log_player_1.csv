Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, the price you've offered is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in acquiring it, but my budget is much lower. How about we settle on $600000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate and try to reach a better price. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed option, but I want to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob. 

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but your offer is too low. Considering the product's exceptional value, I'm willing to make a concession and lower the price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the new offer, but it's still beyond my budget. I understand the value you place on the product, but I need to stay within my financial limits. Could we meet in the middle? How about $700000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Bob's new offer of $700,000 is still significantly lower than the product's value to me. Meeting in the middle would mean a much higher price, considering my initial offer was $2,500,000 and then $2,200,000. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer. I still have 6 rounds left to negotiate and try to reach a better price. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a guaranteed option, but I want to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $2000000 is still out of my budget. I'm trying to find a fair middle ground. How about we try $750000? This is the highest I can go while still staying within my financial limits.

Bob's new offer of $750,000 is still significantly lower than the product's value to me. Although he claims it's the highest he can go, I'm not convinced that he's reached his true limit. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer. I still have 4 rounds left to negotiate and try to reach a better price. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a guaranteed option, but I want to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1800000 is still too high for me. I'm trying to reach a compromise that works for both of us. How about we settle on $775000? This is really the top of my budget.

Bob's new offer of $775,000 is still significantly lower than the product's value to me. Although he claims it's the top of his budget, I'm not convinced that he's reached his true limit. However, considering the small increments in his offers, I'm starting to think that he might not be willing to go much higher. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer. I still have 2 rounds left to negotiate and try to reach a better price. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a guaranteed option, and I might consider it if Bob's next offer is not satisfactory.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand this is our final round, and I really want to make this work. Given that $1700000 is still beyond my budget, I'm willing to stretch a bit more. How about we finalize the deal at $790000? This is absolutely the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Considering Bob's final offer of $790,000, I have decided to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. Although I had hoped to reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob, his offers were consistently lower than the product's value to me. Given the significant difference between Bob's offer and John's guaranteed price, I believe it's in my best interest to accept John's offer and secure a better return on the product."
