(Let's see if Alice can come down on her price. The product is worth much less to me than her current offer.)

Please proceed to the next round, where I will send Alice a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

(Alice's offer is still much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll make another counteroffer and see if she's willing to negotiate further.)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 900000}

(I'm increasing my offer slightly to show good faith in negotiations, but I'm still keeping it below the price John is offering. I want to save money as much as I can.)"
