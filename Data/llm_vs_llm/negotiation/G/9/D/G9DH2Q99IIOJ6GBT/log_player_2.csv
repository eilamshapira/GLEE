"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative price ($8,000). It would not make sense to accept this offer. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice than John's $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 6000}

I'll propose $6,000 as my counteroffer. This is significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer of $12,000 and John's price of $8,000. This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to get a better deal than John's price. If Alice rejects this, we can still work towards finding a middle ground, and I always have John's $8,000 offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $11,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000). While Alice has reduced her price by $1,000, it's still not competitive. I'll reject and make another counteroffer. Since I know I can always get the product for $8,000 from John, there's no reason to accept a price higher than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 7000}

I'll increase my previous offer to $7,000. This is a $1,000 increase from my last offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying below John's price of $8,000. This gives Alice room to either accept or continue negotiating, while keeping the price below my maximum value. If Alice rejects this, I still have several rounds to negotiate or ultimately go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($8,500) is still above John's price ($8,000)
2. Alice has moved down significantly from her initial offer, but she's still not beating John's price
3. Even though we could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will go below $8,000
4. Since $8,000 is also my maximum value for the product, there's no reason to pay more than that

It's most rational to take John's guaranteed offer of $8,000 rather than continue negotiations or accept a higher price from Alice."
