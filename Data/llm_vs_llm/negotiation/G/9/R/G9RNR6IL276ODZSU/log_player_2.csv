"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value to me, I'm asking for $150. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Looking at Alice's offer:

1. Alice is offering the product for $150.
2. The product is worth no more than $150 to me.
3. John is also offering the same product for $150.

Since both Alice and John are offering the product at the same price ($150), and this matches my maximum valuation, I don't have a reason to prefer one seller over the other.
