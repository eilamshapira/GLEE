"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $25000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it, but my maximum budget is $8000. Would you consider selling it for $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While $8000 is too low, I'm willing to work with you to find a suitable price. Could you consider something closer to $20000? This product offers significant value that I believe justifies this price point.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $20000 is still significantly above what I can afford. My absolute maximum is $10000. If that doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options. Let me know.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10000 is still below what I had in mind, I recognize your interest in the product. Let's try to find a middle ground. Would you consider $16000? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my desire to make a deal.",16000.0,Alice,5,
