"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to analyze this situation:

- The product is worth up to $100 to me
- Alice's offer is $95
- If I reject Alice, I can buy from John for $100

Since Alice's offer ($95) is less than what I would pay from John ($100), and still below my maximum value ($100), I should accept Alice's offer to save $5.
