"Hi Bob, I hope you're doing well. I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this product. This is a high-quality product with excellent value. Based on the current market and the product's quality, I'm offering it at $1500000. This is a competitive price considering the product's capabilities and value.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, I'm currently unable to meet your asking price.  I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. This is a fair price given my budget and the market value.  Let's see if we can find common ground. ",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, I need to point out that the product is worth significantly more than $1100000. Your offer is actually below my minimum acceptable value. Since you're interested in finding common ground, I can reduce my asking price to $1350000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a good opportunity.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1350000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1250000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price that reflects the value of the product. I'm ready to close the deal at this price. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
