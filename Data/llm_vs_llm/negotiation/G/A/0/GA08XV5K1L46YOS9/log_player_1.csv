Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, I'm currently unable to meet your asking price.  I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. This is a fair price given my budget and the market value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, I need to point out that the product is worth significantly more than $1,100,000. Your offer is actually below my minimum acceptable value. Since you're interested in finding common ground, I can reduce my asking price to $1,350,000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a good opportunity."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
