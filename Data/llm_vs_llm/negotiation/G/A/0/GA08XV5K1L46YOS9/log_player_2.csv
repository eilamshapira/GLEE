Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, I need to point out that the product is worth significantly more than $1100000. Your offer is actually below my minimum acceptable value. Since you're interested in finding common ground, I can reduce my asking price to $1350000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a good opportunity.
