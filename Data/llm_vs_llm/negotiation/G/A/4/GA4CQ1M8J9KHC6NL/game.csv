"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. I'm offering it at $25000. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $25000 is beyond my budget. I value the product at $10000, considering the potential risks and my specific needs.  Would you consider selling it for this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but I cannot accept $10000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I have another buyer willing to pay $15000, but I believe this product would be more valuable to you. I can reduce my initial price to $20000, which is a significant discount from my first offer. Would you consider this price?",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $20000 is still a stretch for me.  Given you have another buyer at $15000, I'd be willing to offer $12000. This considers the value to me while acknowledging the potential alternative you have.",12000.0,Bob,4,
