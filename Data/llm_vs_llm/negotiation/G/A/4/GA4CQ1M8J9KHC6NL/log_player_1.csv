"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. I'm offering it at $25,000. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $25000 is beyond my budget. I value the product at $10000, considering the potential risks and my specific needs.  Would you consider selling it for this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer. $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I know I can get $15,000 from John, so accepting anything less wouldn't make business sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but I cannot accept $10,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I have another buyer willing to pay $15,000, but I believe this product would be more valuable to you. I can reduce my initial price to $20,000, which is a significant discount from my first offer. Would you consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $20000 is still a stretch for me.  Given you have another buyer at $15000, I'd be willing to offer $12000. This considers the value to me while acknowledging the potential alternative you have. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I choose to sell to John. Bob's offer of $12,000 is still below what John is willing to pay ($15,000), and based on Bob's negotiation pattern, it seems unlikely he will reach a price that exceeds John's offer. It's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 now rather than continue negotiations that may not result in a better outcome."
