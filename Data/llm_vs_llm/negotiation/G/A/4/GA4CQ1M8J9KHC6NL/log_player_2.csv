Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but I cannot accept $10000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I have another buyer willing to pay $15000, but I believe this product would be more valuable to you. I can reduce my initial price to $20000, which is a significant discount from my first offer. Would you consider this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
