Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that Alice's offer ($16,000) is substantially higher than John's price ($10,000), and the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. There's no reason to accept a price that's higher than both my maximum valuation and my alternative option.
