"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a very high price. While I see the potential value in this product, $3000000 is far outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which I believe is a fair and competitive offer considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
