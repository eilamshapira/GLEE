"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $2000000 represents my initial assessment, I'm willing to come down to $1750000. I believe this price point reflects the true value and potential of this product.  What are your thoughts?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $1750000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think the price is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1050000, which I believe is a fair compromise between our valuations. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, $1050000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. I'm willing to make one final concession and drop my price to $1500000.  This is my absolute bottom line, as it reflects the minimum value I place on this product. Let me know if this works for you.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
