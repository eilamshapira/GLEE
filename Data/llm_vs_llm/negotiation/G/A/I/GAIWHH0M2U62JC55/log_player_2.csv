Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but I must decline. $1000000 is significantly below the product's market value and below what I have already been offered elsewhere. I currently have a standing offer from another buyer for $1500000, which represents the absolute minimum I can accept. However, I believe this product would be particularly valuable for you, so I'm willing to offer it at $2200000, which is still a competitive price considering its potential return on investment. Would you be interested at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I do appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, I must point out that $1300000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. As I mentioned, I already have a firm offer of $1500000 from another buyer. Given our ongoing negotiation and my preference to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $1800000, which represents a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects both the true value of the product and my good faith in trying to reach an agreement with you. Would you be able to meet me at this price?
