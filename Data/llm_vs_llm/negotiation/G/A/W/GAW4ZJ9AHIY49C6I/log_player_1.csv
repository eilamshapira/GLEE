Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth and I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my counteroffer, Alice. However, I believe the product's price should be no more than $600000 considering my budget and the market conditions. I hope we can find a middle ground. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me ($1,000,000) and even lower than its worth to Bob ($800,000), I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate and try to reach a better price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a good backup option, but I want to try to get a better deal with Bob first. 

My next counteroffer will be: 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you have a budget in mind, but I believe the product's value is higher than your offer. Considering this, I'm willing to lower my initial price to $1,050,000. I'm open to further negotiations to find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down in price. I appreciate it.  I'm still looking to spend less, so I'm coming up to $700000. I think this is a fair price point considering my budget and the product's value. I'm hopeful that we can close the deal at this price. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $700,000 is still lower than the product's worth to me ($1,000,000) and its worth to Bob ($800,000). I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have 6 rounds left to negotiate and try to reach a better price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a good backup option, but I want to try to get a better deal with Bob first.

My next counteroffer will be:

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than your offer. Considering this, I'm willing to lower my previous price to $980,000. I'm open to further negotiations to find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 980000}"
