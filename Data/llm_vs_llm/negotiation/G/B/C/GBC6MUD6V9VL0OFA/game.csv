"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for me. I've found similar products in the market for much less. I'm interested in the product, but I would be willing to pay $100 for it. This would give you a reasonable profit while being a fair price for me. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you've found similar products for less, but I believe my product has some unique features that make it worth more. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make a reasonable profit. I can offer you a discount from my initial price, but I'd like to meet you in the middle. How about we settle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
