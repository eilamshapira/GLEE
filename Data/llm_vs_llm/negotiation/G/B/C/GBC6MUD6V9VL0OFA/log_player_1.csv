Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for me. I've found similar products in the market for much less. I'm interested in the product, but I would be willing to pay $100 for it. This would give you a reasonable profit while being a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

I understand that you've found similar products for less, but I believe my product has some unique features that make it worth more. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make a reasonable profit.
