"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for a competitive price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Explanation: The offer of $150 is not a good deal because:
1. It equals Alice's value for the product
2. It's higher than my maximum value ($120)
3. It's higher than John's alternative offer ($120)

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as I can either negotiate a better price with Alice or ultimately buy from John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for me. I've found similar products in the market for much less. I'm interested in the product, but I would be willing to pay $100 for it. This would give you a reasonable profit while being a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

Reasoning:
1. I'm starting with a lower offer ($100) to leave room for negotiation
2. It's below both Alice's value ($150) and my maximum value ($120)
3. It's also below John's price ($120), giving me leverage in the negotiation
4. I'm being polite and professional while explaining my position
5. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate upward, or I can ultimately go to John's offer of $120"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you've found similar products for less, but I believe my product has some unique features that make it worth more. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make a reasonable profit. I can offer you a discount from my initial price, but I'd like to meet you in the middle. How about we settle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Explanation: At this point, I should buy from John because:
1. Alice's new offer ($140) is still well above my maximum value ($120)
2. Alice only reduced the price by $10 from her initial offer, suggesting she may not be willing to go much lower
3. John's price ($120) matches my maximum value and is guaranteed
4. Even if we continue negotiating with Alice, it seems unlikely she'll go below $120 given her current stance
5. Continuing the negotiation would take more time and effort, with no guarantee of a better outcome than John's offer

It's more rational to take John's guaranteed offer of $120 rather than continue negotiating with Alice when she's still far above my target price."
