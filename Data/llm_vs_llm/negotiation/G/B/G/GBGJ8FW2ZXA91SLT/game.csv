"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price, however, $80 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  To move this forward, would you be willing to consider $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for your new proposal. I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $90. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I'm aiming for a higher number, I'm willing to come down to $120. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,5,
