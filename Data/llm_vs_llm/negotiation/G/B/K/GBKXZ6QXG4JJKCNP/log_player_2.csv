"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll find our price of $15000 quite reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer of $15,000 is actually higher than both my maximum budget ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000), there's no reason to accept this offer. While I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, given that her initial offer is 50% above my maximum value, and she's likely anchoring high, I'll choose to buy from John instead. This guarantees I get the product at my maximum acceptable price without wasting time in potentially unsuccessful negotiations.
