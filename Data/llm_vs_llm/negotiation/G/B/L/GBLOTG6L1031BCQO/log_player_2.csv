"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer is the same price as John's offer ($10,000), and this is my maximum value for the product, there's no advantage in continuing the negotiation. If I reject and make a counteroffer, Alice might not accept a lower price, and I can't pay more than $10,000 anyway. I might as well accept Alice's offer now.
