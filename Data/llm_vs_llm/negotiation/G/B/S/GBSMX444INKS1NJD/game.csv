"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you today. I'm selling it for $150. This product is valuable and in excellent condition. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $150 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. The same product is available elsewhere for $100, which is my maximum budget. I'd be willing to buy from you for $80 if you're interested - that would save me the hassle of going elsewhere. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is my absolute minimum price point, which is what John is already offering me. Given the quality of this product and its market value, I could come down to $120. This is significantly below my initial offer and represents a fair price considering the product's value. Would you be able to meet me at this price?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on your price, Alice. However, I need to be clear that this product is worth no more than $100 to me, which is what John is charging. For me to purchase from you instead, I would need a better deal. I can offer you $90, which would save me some money while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you?",90.0,Bob,4,
