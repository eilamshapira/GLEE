"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you today. I'm selling it for $150. This product is valuable and in excellent condition. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $150 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. The same product is available elsewhere for $100, which is my maximum budget. I'd be willing to buy from you for $80 if you're interested - that would save me the hassle of going elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is my absolute minimum price point, which is what John is already offering me. Given the quality of this product and its market value, I could come down to $120. This is significantly below my initial offer and represents a fair price considering the product's value. Would you be able to meet me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 120}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on your price, Alice. However, I need to be clear that this product is worth no more than $100 to me, which is what John is charging. For me to purchase from you instead, I would need a better deal. I can offer you $90, which would save me some money while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
