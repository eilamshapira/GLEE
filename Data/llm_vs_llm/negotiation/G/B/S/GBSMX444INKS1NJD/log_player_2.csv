"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you today. I'm selling it for $150. This product is valuable and in excellent condition. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that Alice is asking for $150, which is more than the $100 value this product is worth to you, and John is offering the exact product for $100, I should not accept Alice's offer. I could try to negotiate with Alice, but since I already have a guaranteed option to buy from John at my maximum value point, there's no reason to pay more than $100.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $150 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. The same product is available elsewhere for $100, which is my maximum budget. I'd be willing to buy from you for $80 if you're interested - that would save me the hassle of going elsewhere. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is my absolute minimum price point, which is what John is already offering me. Given the quality of this product and its market value, I could come down to $120. This is significantly below my initial offer and represents a fair price considering the product's value. Would you be able to meet me at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has reduced her price to $120, but this is still above the $100 that John is offering, and since the product is only worth $100 to me, I should not pay more than that. John's offer remains the better option at $100.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on your price, Alice. However, I need to be clear that this product is worth no more than $100 to me, which is what John is charging. For me to purchase from you instead, I would need a better deal. I can offer you $90, which would save me some money while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
