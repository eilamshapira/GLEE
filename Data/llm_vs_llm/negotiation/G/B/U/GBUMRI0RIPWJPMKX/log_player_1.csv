"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your interest in a negotiation, but $20000 is far above what I am willing to pay. Considering the value from my perspective, I can offer to buy the product for $8000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $8,000 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll proceed to the next round to send a counteroffer, hoping to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20,000 might be too high, but $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'll lower my initial offer, but I still believe the product's value is higher than your proposed price."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
