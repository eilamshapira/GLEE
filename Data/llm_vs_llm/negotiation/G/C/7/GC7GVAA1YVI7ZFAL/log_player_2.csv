"Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the options:

1. Alice's offer: $119
2. John's price: $120
3. My maximum value: $120

Alice's offer is $1 less than John's price, and both are within my maximum value of $120. While the savings is minimal ($1), it's still the better economic choice to accept Alice's offer rather than pay more to John.
