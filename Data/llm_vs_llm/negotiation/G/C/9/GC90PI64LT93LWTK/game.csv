"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $14000 is a bit steep. Given market conditions, I'd be willing to purchase it for $11500. This represents a significant profit margin for you while still being a fair price for me. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However, I'm confident in the product's value and the demand for it. How about we meet in the middle at $13000? I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. You make a good point about finding middle ground. Since you moved $1000 from your initial offer, I'm also willing to move up from my previous position. I can offer $12000, which gives you a healthy profit margin while still being a fair price for both parties. How does that sound?",12000.0,Bob,4,
