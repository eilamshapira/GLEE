Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $14000 is a bit steep. Given market conditions, I'd be willing to purchase it for $11500. This represents a significant profit margin for you while still being a fair price for me. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. You make a good point about finding middle ground. Since you moved $1000 from your initial offer, I'm also willing to move up from my previous position. I can offer $12000, which gives you a healthy profit margin while still being a fair price for both parties. How does that sound?
