"Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be of great value to you. I am offering it for $12000. This is a high-quality item that delivers excellent performance and reliability. I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have about it.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the premium quality you're highlighting, I need to be transparent that the product is worth no more than $10000 to me. In fact, I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product. This gives you a chance to make the sale while allowing me some savings compared to my alternative option.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in doing business with me. While I understand you mentioned another seller offering the product for $10000, I can assure you that my product is of superior quality. Given that my minimum acceptable price is above $8500 and considering the premium value I'm providing, I can offer it to you for $10500. This is still a better deal than what you mentioned is available elsewhere, and you'll be getting exceptional quality. Let me know if this works for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for coming down on your price. I do appreciate the quality you're offering, but I need to be clear about my position. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and as I mentioned, John is offering it at exactly $10000. For me to choose your product over his, I would need a better price. I can offer you $9500, which would be my best offer. This allows you to make the sale while giving me a small savings compared to John's offer. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
