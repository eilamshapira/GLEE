"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad we can continue the negotiation. Considering the product's value and your initial interest, I'd like to make a counteroffer that brings us closer together. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500, which is a more reasonable price given its worth.",12500.0,Alice,3,
