Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'd like to start the negotiation at a price that reflects its true value."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'd be happy to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to counteroffer since $10,000 is lower than my initial offer, and I believe the product is worth more to Bob than he's currently willing to pay. My next step will be to send a counteroffer to Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad we can continue the negotiation. Considering the product's value and your initial interest, I'd like to make a counteroffer that brings us closer together. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500, which is a more reasonable price given its worth."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
