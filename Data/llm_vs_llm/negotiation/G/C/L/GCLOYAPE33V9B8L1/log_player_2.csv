"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'd like to start the negotiation at a price that reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $15,000. I need to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'd be happy to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad we can continue the negotiation. Considering the product's value and your initial interest, I'd like to make a counteroffer that brings us closer together. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500, which is a more reasonable price given its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,500 is within my budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer. It's a good deal for me, and I'd rather secure the product now than risk further negotiation and potentially lose it."
