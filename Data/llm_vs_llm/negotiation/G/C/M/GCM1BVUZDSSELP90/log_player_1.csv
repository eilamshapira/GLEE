Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 15000}

Rationale: Since I know that:
1. The product is worth $10,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer of $15,000 from John
3. I won't accept less than $15,000

There's no reason for me to offer Bob any price below $15,000. Even though I know Bob values it at $10,000 and will likely reject this offer, I'm not losing anything by making this offer because I have John's guaranteed $15,000 offer as a backup. This strategy ensures I get the maximum value ($15,000) for my product."
