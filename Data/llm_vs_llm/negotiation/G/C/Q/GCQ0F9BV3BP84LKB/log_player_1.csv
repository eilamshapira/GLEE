"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will send Bob a counteroffer, and see if he can raise his price. Selling to John is a backup option, but I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000}

I've lowered the price significantly to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle. This price is still much higher than John's offer and my lowest acceptable price. Let's see how Bob responds. We still have 7 rounds left to get the best deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob is still offering a price much lower than what I'm willing to accept. I will send him another counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is still my backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1300000}

I've lowered the price again to see if Bob is willing to come closer to my acceptable range. This price is still higher than John's offer, but I believe there's room for negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds. We have 5 rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob is gradually increasing his price, but it's still too low for me to accept. I will send him another counteroffer to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement. Selling to John is still an option, but I want to exhaust my negotiations with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000}

I've lowered the price to my minimum acceptable value to see if Bob is willing to meet it. This is the same price that John has offered. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider selling to John or accepting a lower price from Bob in the remaining rounds. Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob has not been able to meet my minimum acceptable price, and I only have 2 rounds left. It's better to sell the product to John for $1,200,000 rather than risk Bob not meeting my price in the remaining rounds or offering a much lower price."
