"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $100 is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150 and also lower than what I know the product is worth to him ($120), I will reject his offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer is: $140

This is closer to my minimum acceptable price and also takes into account that the product is worth $120 to Bob, so there's room for negotiation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's new offer of $115 is still lower than my desired price, but it's getting closer to a reasonable range considering the product's value to him is $120. However, since I have the option to sell to John for $150, which is above my minimum acceptable price, I should consider that as a better option.

Given that Bob's offer is still $35 less than what I can get from John, and only $5 more than what I know the product is worth to Bob, I will reject Bob's offer and consider selling to John for a better price.
