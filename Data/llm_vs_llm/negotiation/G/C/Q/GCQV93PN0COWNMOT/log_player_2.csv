"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that has immense potential value. I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable in your hands. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a substantial discount considering its true potential.  Consider this a chance to secure a rare asset. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your alternative option (buying from John for $1,000,000).  While Alice believes the product is worth a lot, her sales pitch feels inflated and doesn't offer concrete reasons why it would be worth that much to *you*. 

By rejecting this offer, you can:

* **Potentially negotiate:** Alice might be willing to lower her price, especially if she's eager to sell.
* **Stick with John:** You have a guaranteed backup option at a much lower price."
