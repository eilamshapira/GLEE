Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it for $25,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $25000 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Considering my minimum acceptable price is $10,000, and Bob is offering exactly that...

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
