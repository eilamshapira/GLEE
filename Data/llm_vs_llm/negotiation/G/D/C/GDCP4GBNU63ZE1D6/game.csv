,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for starting the negotiation. While I believe the product has value, $20000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to spend. To be frank, my budget for this is closer to $8000. Would you consider an offer in that range?",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but $4000 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable selling the product for. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your budget is around $8000, I'd like to propose a price that's closer to the value I believe the product holds.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but $18000 is still much higher than what I had in mind. To be completely honest, if the price can't come closer to $6000, I might have to explore other options.",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm also trying to be flexible here. Since you've increased your offer to $6000, I'm willing to decrease my price further. However, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal for the product's value. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm thinking somewhere around $12000 could work, considering the product's worth and your budget constraints.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. I've been thinking about the value of the product and my budget limitations.  To be completely upfront, $8000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If you're able to accept this offer, I'm ready to close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll unfortunately need to reconsider my options.",8000.0,Bob,6,
