Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for starting the negotiation. While I believe the product has value, $20000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to spend. To be frank, my budget for this is closer to $8000. Would you consider an offer in that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us. My next offer will be $18,000. This is still below my initial offer but significantly higher than Bob's offer, indicating my willingness to negotiate while also emphasizing the product's value."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but $4,000 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable selling the product for. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your budget is around $8,000, I'd like to propose a price that's closer to the value I believe the product holds."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but $18000 is still much higher than what I had in mind. To be completely honest, if the price can't come closer to $6000, I might have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. His latest offer of $6,000 is still below what I'm willing to accept, but it shows he's willing to increase his budget. I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my previous counteroffer.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm also trying to be flexible here. Since you've increased your offer to $6,000, I'm willing to decrease my price further. However, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal for the product's value. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. I've been thinking about the value of the product and my budget limitations.  To be completely upfront, $8000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If you're able to accept this offer, I'm ready to close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll unfortunately need to reconsider my options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's final offer of $8,000 is still below what I consider a fair price for the product. Given that I have the option to sell the product to John for $15,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer, it makes more sense to accept John's offer. This ensures I get a better price for the product, which is my primary goal."
