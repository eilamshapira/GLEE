"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**  Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It makes sense to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for starting the negotiation. While I believe the product has value, $20,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to spend. To be frank, my budget for this is closer to $8,000. Would you consider an offer in that range?"",
""product_price"": 4000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a low offer ($4,000) to see how much Alice is willing to move on price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Transparency:** I'm being transparent about my budget range to signal that offers significantly above $8,000 are unlikely to be accepted. 
* **Polite but Firm:**  I'm maintaining a polite and professional tone while being firm about my budget limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but $4000 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable selling the product for. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your budget is around $8000, I'd like to propose a price that's closer to the value I believe the product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice lowered her price slightly, it's still significantly higher than my budget. It's clear she's anchoring to a high initial offer. I'll continue negotiating, but I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but $18,000 is still much higher than what I had in mind. To be completely honest, if the price can't come closer to $6,000, I might have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer, But Firm Limit:** I've significantly increased my offer to $6,000, showing willingness to move, but I'm also setting a clear upper limit. This signals I'm serious about my budget constraints.
* **Introducing Alternatives:** By mentioning ""other options,"" I subtly introduce the possibility of walking away from the negotiation. This creates some pressure without being overly aggressive. 
* **Goal:** The aim is to gauge Alice's flexibility. If she's willing to engage within my budget range, we can continue negotiating. If not, I'll need to consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm also trying to be flexible here. Since you've increased your offer to $6000, I'm willing to decrease my price further. However, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal for the product's value. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm thinking somewhere around $12000 could work, considering the product's worth and your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly reducing her price, but $12,000 is still too high. It seems she might be more willing to negotiate around a price point closer to my maximum budget. I'll make one more offer closer to my limit to test the waters before considering John's offer seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. I've been thinking about the value of the product and my budget limitations.  To be completely upfront, $8,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If you're able to accept this offer, I'm ready to close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll unfortunately need to reconsider my options."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer and matches my maximum budget. 
* **Transparency and Firmness:** I'm being completely transparent that this is my limit, and I'm ready to walk away if it's not accepted.
* **Urgency:** By stating I need to ""reconsider my options,"" I'm adding a sense of urgency to encourage a decision. 

Now, it's up to Alice. This offer gives her a final chance to make a sale while still exceeding my perceived alternative ($8,000 from John)."
