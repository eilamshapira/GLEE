"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2000000. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm open to negotiations if you're interested.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $2000000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I can offer it to you for $1500000.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1500000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000. This is close to my maximum budget, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $1100000 is still a bit short of my expectations. Given that you mentioned it's close to your maximum budget, I'm willing to make a serious compromise. I can offer the product to you for $1400000, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still above what I can afford. I'm prepared to go up to $1150000, which is really stretching my budget. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your efforts to stretch your budget. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1150000. Given that we're getting close to a mutually agreeable price, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer the product to you for $1300000. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1200000, which is the absolute maximum I can go. If this doesn't work, I might have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
