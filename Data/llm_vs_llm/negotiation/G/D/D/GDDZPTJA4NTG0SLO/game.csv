"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'm looking for $9500, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I still have to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $7000 is a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? I think this price reflects the product's value and is a reasonable compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I think we're still not quite there. How about I offer you $7500 instead?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to get a price that I'm comfortable with. $7500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down further, but I think $8500 is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you.",8500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I think there's still room for negotiation. How about we settle for $8000? This way, we both give a little and get a little.",8000.0,Bob,6,
