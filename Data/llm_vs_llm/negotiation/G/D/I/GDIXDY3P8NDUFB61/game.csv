"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, I believe your asking price is still quite high. Given current market conditions and considering similar products available, I would like to make a counteroffer of $950000. This offers you a significant profit margin while being more aligned with my budget constraints. I look forward to your response.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand budget constraints are important, but I need to consider the true value of this product. The asking price of $1300000 was already below the market value, considering what this product can deliver for you. However, I'm willing to meet you partway. I can offer the product for $1150000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's exceptional value and potential return on investment for your business. I believe this is a fair middle ground that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
