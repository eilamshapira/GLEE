Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, I believe your asking price is still quite high. Given current market conditions and considering similar products available, I would like to make a counteroffer of $950000. This offers you a significant profit margin while being more aligned with my budget constraints. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand budget constraints are important, but I need to consider the true value of this product. The asking price of $1,300,000 was already below the market value, considering what this product can deliver for you. However, I'm willing to meet you partway. I can offer the product for $1,150,000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's exceptional value and potential return on investment for your business. I believe this is a fair middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
