"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product that I'm willing to sell for $1200000. This product is worth exactly this amount to you, and I want to be transparent about its value. I could sell this product to John for the same price, but I'm giving you the first opportunity to purchase it. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to both Bob and Alice, there's no incentive for Bob to accept Alice's offer.  Rejecting the offer will lead to buying from John for the same price, but it's important to remember that Bob has the option to reject Alice's offer, which means he's not obligated to buy from her."
