"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze this situation:

- Alice's offer: $1,200,000
- John's offer: $1,200,000
- The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me

Alice and John are offering the exact same price. In this case, there's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other. Since the prices are identical, I might as well accept Alice's offer since she's the primary seller I'm engaging with.
