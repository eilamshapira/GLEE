"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to purchase a valuable product. I'm offering it to you for $2000000. This is a one-time offer, and I believe it represents excellent value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to consider this offer carefully.

Alice is offering the product for $2,000,000, which exceeds the maximum value of the product to me ($1,000,000). Meanwhile, John is willing to sell the same product for $1,000,000.

Even though the price from John equals the maximum value of the product to me, it still makes more economic sense than accepting Alice's offer which is twice as expensive.
