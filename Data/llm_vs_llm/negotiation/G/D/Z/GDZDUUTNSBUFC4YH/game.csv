"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's quite a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. I'm looking for something more economical. I'm willing to pay $5000 for the product.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for something more economical, but I'm afraid $5000 is too low for this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'd like to counteroffer at $10000, which I believe better reflects the product's value.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $10000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to come up a bit from my previous offer. I'm willing to pay $6500 for the product.",6500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to come up from your previous offer. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'd like to counteroffer at $9500, which is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",9500.0,Alice,5,
