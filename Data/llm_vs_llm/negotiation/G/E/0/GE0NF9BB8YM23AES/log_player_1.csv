Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","I'll analyze this situation:

My product is worth at least $12,000 to me.
Bob's offer is $13,000, which is $1,000 more than what John offers.
The maximum value I could get is $15,000 (what the product is worth to Bob).

Bob rejected my initial offer of $14,000, but his counteroffer of $13,000 is still better than my outside option of selling to John for $12,000. I could make another counteroffer, but there's risk in continuing to negotiate as Bob might walk away.
