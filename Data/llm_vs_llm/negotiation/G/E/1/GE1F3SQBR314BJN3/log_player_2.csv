"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
The asking price of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000 and John's price. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 600000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $600,000. This is significantly below John's price of $800,000, which gives me room to negotiate upward if needed. Since Alice's initial offer was quite high, starting low allows for potential compromise while still keeping the final price potentially below John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly above John's price of $800,000. While Alice has moved down from her initial offer, indicating some flexibility, the current price is still not competitive with John's offer. I'll reject and make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'll increase my offer to $700,000. This is still below John's price of $800,000, giving me room to potentially negotiate further if needed, but it also shows significant movement from my previous offer of $600,000 to demonstrate that I'm negotiating in good faith. It's a reasonable middle ground that could lead to a deal below John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly above John's price of $800,000
2. While Alice has been lowering her price ($1.5M → $1.2M → $1.1M), the rate of decrease suggests we're unlikely to reach a price below $800,000 in the remaining rounds
3. We've already gone through half of our available rounds, and the gap between our positions is still very large
4. John's offer of $800,000 is at my maximum value threshold, and it's a guaranteed option

It's better to secure the product at $800,000 from John than risk further negotiations that may not reach a better price with Alice."
