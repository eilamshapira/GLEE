"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($12,000), I will reject her offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm willing to pay up to $12,000, I'll start by offering a lower price and see how Alice responds.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $18,000 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. Since she rejected my previous counteroffer of $8,000, I'll try to meet her halfway and make another counteroffer.

However, for now, I'll reject her offer and consider making another counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer decreased from $20,000 to $18,000, it shows that she's willing to negotiate. My previous offer of $8,000 was rejected, so I'll increase it to $10,000, which is still below my maximum budget of $12,000.

{""product_price"": $10,000}"

Round 5

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $16,000 is still higher than I'm willing to pay, but it's getting closer to my maximum budget. Since she's consistently decreasing her price, I'll reject her offer again and try to make another counteroffer to see if I can get her to meet me at my target price.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer decreased from $18,000 to $16,000, it shows that she's willing to continue negotiating. My previous offer of $10,000 was rejected, so I'll increase it to $11,000, which is still below my maximum budget of $12,000, but getting closer to it. This should give Alice an incentive to consider my offer seriously.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $15,000 is still higher than I'm willing to pay, and I'm getting close to my maximum budget. At this point, I have to consider that buying from John for $12,000 might be a better option. However, I'll try one more time to see if Alice is willing to meet me at my target price.

I'll reject her offer again and make another counteroffer, but this time, I'll go all the way up to my maximum budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer decreased to $15,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's at my maximum budget, hoping that she'll accept it. I'll offer $12,000, which is the same price that John is offering, but I'd prefer to buy from Alice if possible.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","At this point, Alice's offer of $14,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $12,000. Since she rejected my previous offer of $12,000, it's clear that she's not willing to meet me at my target price.

Given that I have the option to buy the product from John for $12,000, which is my maximum budget, I think it's time to stop negotiating with Alice and take the better deal.
