Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what price to offer Bob that maximizes my earnings while ensuring I have a reasonable chance of making the sale.

Since the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at exactly $800,000, I should offer Bob a price higher than $800,000.

If I set the price too high, Bob might reject it. If I set it too close to $800,000, I'm not maximizing my potential profit. Without knowing Bob's valuation, I'll need to make a reasonable estimate of what might be acceptable while still being profitable.

I'll offer a price that represents a significant but not extreme markup over my minimum acceptable value:

{""product_price"": 1,200,000}"
