"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for both of us. I'm looking to get a fair price for it, considering its value and rarity.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I find $950000 to be quite high for this product. I understand its value, but I'm looking for a more reasonable price point. Based on my market research and budget considerations, I'd like to counter with $830000. This gives you a reasonable profit while also allowing me to make this purchase within my budget constraints.",830000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $830000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your budget constraints. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000, considering the product's unique features and value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm open to further discussion and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. That shows we're both committed to making this deal work. However, $900000 is still higher than what I was hoping to pay. Given that I have the option to purchase from another seller at $1000000, I'm looking for a more compelling price difference to justify buying from you. I can offer $860000, which gives you a substantial profit while providing me with meaningful savings compared to my alternative option. How does that sound?",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $860000. I appreciate your transparency about your alternative options and the price difference you're looking for. I'm willing to continue negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering my previous offer of $900000 and your counteroffer, I'd like to propose a compromise at $880000. This price takes into account your needs and provides me with a reasonable return on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",880000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your new offer of $880000. We're definitely getting closer to an agreement. I'd like to propose $870000 as a final price - this represents a fair middle ground between our last positions. At this price, I'm comfortable proceeding with the purchase immediately rather than continuing negotiations or exploring other options. This deal would give you a solid profit while also providing me with the savings I need to justify the purchase. What do you say to finalizing our deal at $870000?",870000.0,Bob,6,
