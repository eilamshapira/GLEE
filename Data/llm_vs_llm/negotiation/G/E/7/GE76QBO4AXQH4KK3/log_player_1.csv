"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I find $950000 to be quite high for this product. I understand its value, but I'm looking for a more reasonable price point. Based on my market research and budget considerations, I'd like to counter with $830000. This gives you a reasonable profit while also allowing me to make this purchase within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $830,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $830,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to counteroffer, as $830,000 is close to my minimum, but I believe I can get a better price. I'll send a new offer to Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $830,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your budget constraints. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000, considering the product's unique features and value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm open to further discussion and finding a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. That shows we're both committed to making this deal work. However, $900000 is still higher than what I was hoping to pay. Given that I have the option to purchase from another seller at $1000000, I'm looking for a more compelling price difference to justify buying from you. I can offer $860000, which gives you a substantial profit while providing me with meaningful savings compared to my alternative option. How does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to counteroffer again, as $860,000 is still lower than I'd like, but it's getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with. I'll try to meet Bob halfway between my previous offer and his counteroffer. 

Next, I'll send a new offer to Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $860,000. I appreciate your transparency about your alternative options and the price difference you're looking for. I'm willing to continue negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering my previous offer of $900,000 and your counteroffer, I'd like to propose a compromise at $880,000. This price takes into account your needs and provides me with a reasonable return on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 880000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your new offer of $880000. We're definitely getting closer to an agreement. I'd like to propose $870000 as a final price - this represents a fair middle ground between our last positions. At this price, I'm comfortable proceeding with the purchase immediately rather than continuing negotiations or exploring other options. This deal would give you a solid profit while also providing me with the savings I need to justify the purchase. What do you say to finalizing our deal at $870000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I think $870,000 is a fair price, considering the negotiations we've had and the value of the product. It's close to my desired price, and accepting this offer will ensure a successful sale. Rejecting it and trying to negotiate further might risk losing the deal, and selling to John for $800,000 would mean leaving $70,000 on the table. I'm willing to accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
