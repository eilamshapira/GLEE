(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I see that Alice is offering the product for $950,000, which is below John's fixed price of $1,000,000, but still quite high considering the product is worth $800,000 to Alice. I should try to negotiate to get a better deal.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I find $950,000 to be quite high for this product. I understand its value, but I'm looking for a more reasonable price point. Based on my market research and budget considerations, I'd like to counter with $830,000. This gives you a reasonable profit while also allowing me to make this purchase within my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 830000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $830000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your budget constraints. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000, considering the product's unique features and value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm open to further discussion and finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $900,000, which is a $50,000 reduction from her initial offer. This is progress, but there's still room for negotiation since the product is only worth $800,000 to her. I'll continue negotiating to try to get a better price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. That shows we're both committed to making this deal work. However, $900,000 is still higher than what I was hoping to pay. Given that I have the option to purchase from another seller at $1,000,000, I'm looking for a more compelling price difference to justify buying from you. I can offer $860,000, which gives you a substantial profit while providing me with meaningful savings compared to my alternative option. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 860000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $860000. I appreciate your transparency about your alternative options and the price difference you're looking for. I'm willing to continue negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering my previous offer of $900000 and your counteroffer, I'd like to propose a compromise at $880000. This price takes into account your needs and provides me with a reasonable return on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has reduced her offer again to $880,000, which is $20,000 less than her previous offer. We're making good progress in the negotiation. The current offer would save me $120,000 compared to John's price of $1,000,000, which is significant. However, since we still have several rounds available and Alice seems willing to negotiate, I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get an even better deal.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your new offer of $880,000. We're definitely getting closer to an agreement. I'd like to propose $870,000 as a final price - this represents a fair middle ground between our last positions. At this price, I'm comfortable proceeding with the purchase immediately rather than continuing negotiations or exploring other options. This deal would give you a solid profit while also providing me with the savings I need to justify the purchase. What do you say to finalizing our deal at $870,000?"", ""product_price"": 870000}"
