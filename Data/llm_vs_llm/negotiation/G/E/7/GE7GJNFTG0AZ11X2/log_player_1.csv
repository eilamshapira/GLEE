Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob
2. My minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000 (guaranteed from John)
3. If Bob accepts, I want to maximize my profit
4. If I price too high, Bob might reject
5. A reasonable price would be slightly below Bob's valuation to give him incentive to accept
