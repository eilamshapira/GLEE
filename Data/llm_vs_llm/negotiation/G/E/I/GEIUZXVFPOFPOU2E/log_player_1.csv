Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, this establishes my absolute minimum. However, the product is only worth $12,000 to Bob, which means he shouldn't rationally pay more than that.

Since Bob's maximum value ($12,000) is below my minimum acceptable value ($15,000), there isn't a zone of possible agreement here. Any price that would be acceptable to me would be too high for Bob.

In this case, I should either:
1) Offer a price at Bob's maximum value to see if he'll accept it (though it would be irrational for him to do so)
2) Offer a price at my minimum and prepare to sell to John when Bob inevitably declines

I'll offer Bob the product at my minimum acceptable price:

{""product_price"": 15000}"
