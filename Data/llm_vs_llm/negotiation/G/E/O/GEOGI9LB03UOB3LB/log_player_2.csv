"Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of $130, make a counteroffer, or buy from John for $120.

Given that:
- The product is worth no more than $120 to me
- Alice's product costs her $120 (her reservation value)
- John is offering the same product for $120

Since Alice's offer of $130 is higher than both my maximum value and John's price, it doesn't make sense to accept it. John's offer of $120 matches my maximum value, so I wouldn't save any money by accepting Alice's current offer.

The logical choice is to either make a counteroffer to Alice (which she might accept if it's above her $120 cost) or buy from John immediately.

Since I can always fall back on John's offer, and there's a possibility Alice might accept a lower price to make some sale, I'll reject Alice's offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's below John's price but still potentially acceptable to Alice, as she might be willing to make some profit rather than no sale.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has lowered her price to $125, but it's still higher than John's price of $120. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, and John's offer is $5 cheaper than Alice's current offer, I should either try another counteroffer or go with John's option.

Since John's price is guaranteed at $120, and there's no indication Alice would go below that (as the product costs her $120), the rational choice is to buy from John.
