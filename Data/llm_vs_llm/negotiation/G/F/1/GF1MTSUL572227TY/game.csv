"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is quite high for my budget. Given market conditions and my research, I would be willing to pay $6500 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. Let me know what you think.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and I appreciate your research. However, the product holds significant value, and I wouldn't want to undervalue it. I could offer it to you for $12500. Let me know if we can make this work for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $12500 is still beyond what I can justify for this product. I understand you want to get fair value, but I could get this product elsewhere for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I can offer $7200, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This would be a fair price that works for my budget while still giving you a good return.",7200.0,Bob,4,
