Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is quite high for my budget. Given market conditions and my research, I would be willing to pay $6500 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. Let me know what you think.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $12500 is still beyond what I can justify for this product. I understand you want to get fair value, but I could get this product elsewhere for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I can offer $7200, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This would be a fair price that works for my budget while still giving you a good return.
