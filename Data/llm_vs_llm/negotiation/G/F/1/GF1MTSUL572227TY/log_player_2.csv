"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for $15000. It's a fair price considering its value and quality. Let me know if you're interested or if you'd like to discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $15,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000. Since I can buy the product from John for $8,000, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to Alice. If we can't reach an agreement at a price below $8,000, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is quite high for my budget. Given market conditions and my research, I would be willing to pay $6,500 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 6500}

The strategy here is to start with a counteroffer below my maximum price of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation. Since I can always buy from John at $8,000, I want to try to get a better deal from Alice. Starting at $6,500 gives us room to negotiate upward while still potentially landing at a price better than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and I appreciate your research. However, the product holds significant value, and I wouldn't want to undervalue it. I could offer it to you for $12500. Let me know if we can make this work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $12,500 is still well above my maximum value of $8,000 and higher than John's guaranteed price of $8,000. While Alice has come down from her initial offer, the price is still not competitive. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, continuing to negotiate for a better price. If we can't reach an agreement below $8,000, I can still purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $12,500 is still beyond what I can justify for this product. I understand you want to get fair value, but I could get this product elsewhere for $8,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I can offer $7,200, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This would be a fair price that works for my budget while still giving you a good return."", ""product_price"": 7200}

I'm using a strategic approach by:
1. Mentioning the alternative price ($8,000) to show I have other options
2. Increasing my offer significantly from the previous $6,500 to show good faith
3. Staying below my maximum value and John's price
4. Maintaining a positive tone while emphasizing mutual benefit
The goal is to either secure a price better than John's $8,000 offer or, if unsuccessful, fall back on John's option."
