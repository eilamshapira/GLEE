,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out with this opportunity. However, I believe your asking price is quite high compared to the market value of this product. I understand the product is valuable, but I'm working with budget constraints. I would like to counter with an offer of $1100000, which I think is fair and would still provide you with a good profit margin. Let me know your thoughts on this proposal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. However, given the significant value this product holds, I believe a fair middle ground would be $1300000. This price reflects both the product's market value and ensures you gain substantial benefits from its acquisition. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price point.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on your price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $1300000 is moving in the right direction, but I still feel it's higher than what I can justify for this product. I'd like to meet you closer to the middle and offer $1175000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer while still giving me some budget flexibility. I believe this is a fair compromise that would work well for both of us.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
