Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out with this opportunity. However, I believe your asking price is quite high compared to the market value of this product. I understand the product is valuable, but I'm working with budget constraints. I would like to counter with an offer of $1100000, which I think is fair and would still provide you with a good profit margin. Let me know your thoughts on this proposal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

However, given the significant value this product holds, I believe a fair middle ground would be $1,300,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on your price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $1300000 is moving in the right direction, but I still feel it's higher than what I can justify for this product. I'd like to meet you closer to the middle and offer $1175000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer while still giving me some budget flexibility. I believe this is a fair compromise that would work well for both of us.
