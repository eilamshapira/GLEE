"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I believe this product will be a valuable addition for you. I am offering it to you for $1400000, which will ensure both of us benefit from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Alice is offering the product for $1,400,000. This is less than John's price of $1,500,000, so it's already saving me $100,000 compared to my alternative option.

However, I know the product is only worth $1,000,000 to Alice, which means there's significant room for negotiation. By rejecting this initial offer and making a counteroffer, I may be able to get a better price.

Since Alice's current offer already provides some savings compared to John's price, and there's potential to negotiate an even better deal, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out with this opportunity. However, I believe your asking price is quite high compared to the market value of this product. I understand the product is valuable, but I'm working with budget constraints. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,100,000, which I think is fair and would still provide you with a good profit margin. Let me know your thoughts on this proposal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. However, given the significant value this product holds, I believe a fair middle ground would be $1300000. This price reflects both the product's market value and ensures you gain substantial benefits from its acquisition. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has lowered her price from $1,400,000 to $1,300,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is a $200,000 savings compared to John's price of $1,500,000, which is good progress.

However, knowing that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, there's still room to negotiate for a better price. Alice came down $100,000 from her initial offer, which suggests she might be willing to reduce the price further.

I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating with a counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on your price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $1,300,000 is moving in the right direction, but I still feel it's higher than what I can justify for this product. I'd like to meet you closer to the middle and offer $1,175,000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer while still giving me some budget flexibility. I believe this is a fair compromise that would work well for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1175000}"
