"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe $12000 is a bit steep for my budget. Considering other options available to me, I'm willing to offer $6000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $6000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $10500, which is lower than my initial price but still reflects the product's worth.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking towards a price that better fits my budget constraints. Would you consider selling the product for $7000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I can see that we're getting closer, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer the product to you for $9500. This is the lowest I'm comfortable going so far, considering the product's value.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I really value this product, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $7500? I'm confident that this price is more manageable on my end.",7500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I can see that we're close, but I'm still not quite there. Considering the product's value and the fact that I have other options, I'm willing to make a serious compromise. I can offer the product to you for $8500. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,7,
