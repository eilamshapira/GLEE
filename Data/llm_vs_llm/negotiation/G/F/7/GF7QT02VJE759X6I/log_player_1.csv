Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe $12000 is a bit steep for my budget. Considering other options available to me, I'm willing to offer $6000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is lower than what I can get from John ($8,000), and it's also lower than the product's value to me, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking towards a price that better fits my budget constraints. Would you consider selling the product for $7000?

Since Bob's offer of $7,000 is still lower than what I can get from John ($8,000), and it's also lower than the product's value to me, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob, but if not, I can always fall back on John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit short of what I'm looking for.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I really value this product, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $7500? I'm confident that this price is more manageable on my end.

Although Bob's offer of $7,500 is getting closer to what I can get from John ($8,000), it's still lower. I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. Since we're already at round 6, I'll try to be more aggressive in my pricing to see if I can get a better deal. If not, I can always sell to John."
