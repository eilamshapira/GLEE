"Thank you for your offer, Alice, but $95 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about I give you $65 for the product. Would that work?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $65 is below what I can accept for this product. The quality and value of this item justifies a higher price. I can come down to $88. This is still a good deal considering the product's worth. Would this price work for you?",88.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice, but $88 is still more than I am willing to pay. I can go up to $70. How about that?",70.0,Bob,4,
