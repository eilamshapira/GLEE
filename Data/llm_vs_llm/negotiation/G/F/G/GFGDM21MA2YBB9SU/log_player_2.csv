"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $2000000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your alternative option of buying from John for $1,200,000. There's no reason to accept such a high price."
