"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start by making a relatively high offer to maximize my potential earnings. I can always adjust my price later based on Bob's response.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($8,000), but I still don't know the maximum price Bob is willing to pay, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

My counteroffer will be slightly lower than my initial offer to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but still higher than Bob's offer to try to maximize my earnings.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob was willing to pay $10,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. This will show that I'm willing to negotiate and compromise.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's new offer of $10,500 is getting closer to my initial offer, and it's a significant increase from his previous offer of $10,000. Since I still don't know the maximum price Bob is willing to pay, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer again and make another counteroffer to try to get an even better price.

However, I'll make a smaller adjustment this time, as Bob is already getting close to my target price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's last offer was $10,500, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous counteroffer, but still higher than Bob's last offer. This will show that I'm willing to continue negotiating and find a mutually beneficial price.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's new offer of $10,800 is getting very close to my target price, and it's a significant increase from his previous offers. At this point, I'm starting to think that Bob is serious about buying the product and is willing to pay a premium for it.

Considering that I have only 4 rounds left to negotiate, and Bob's offer is already higher than my minimum acceptable price, I'll choose to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $10,800. This will ensure that I get a good price for the product and avoid the risk of Bob walking away from the deal.
