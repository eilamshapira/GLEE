"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. After careful consideration of the market value and quality of the product, I'm offering it to you for $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice is offering the product for $12,000, but you can get it for $10,000 from John.  It makes more sense to buy from John and save the $2,000."
