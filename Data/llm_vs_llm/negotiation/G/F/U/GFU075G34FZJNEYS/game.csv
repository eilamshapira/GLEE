"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I've researched the market, and I can get a similar product elsewhere for $15000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $12000 for the product?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your price point, $12000 is significantly below its value. I've already got a standing offer for $15000, so I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $20000?",20000.0,Alice,3,
