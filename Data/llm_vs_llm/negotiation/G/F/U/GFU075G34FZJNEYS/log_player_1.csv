Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I've researched the market, and I can get a similar product elsewhere for $15000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $12000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your price point, $12,000 is significantly below its value. I've already got a standing offer for $15,000, so I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $20,000?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
