"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this excellent product.  I'm asking for $25000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($15,000) and John's alternative price ($15,000). It would be illogical to accept this offer. I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price, knowing I always have John's offer as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25,000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I've researched the market, and I can get a similar product elsewhere for $15,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $12,000 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

I'm starting with an offer below John's price of $15,000 to leave room for negotiation, while also signaling to Alice that I have alternative options. This creates leverage for negotiation while still giving us room to reach a mutually beneficial agreement if possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your price point, $12000 is significantly below its value. I've already got a standing offer for $15000, so I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $20000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice mentioned she already has a standing offer at $15,000 and is only willing to lower her price to $20,000 (which is still above my maximum value of $15,000), it's best to take John's offer at $15,000. Alice's negotiating position suggests she's unlikely to go below $15,000, making further negotiation futile. John's price matches my maximum value and represents a fair deal."
