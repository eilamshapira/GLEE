"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its worth to me."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Considering my assessment and current market options, I'm prepared to acquire the product for $600000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $600,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get a better deal either from Bob or by selling to John later if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you, Bob, for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I must emphasize that the product's value to me is significantly higher. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a more serious offer. Considering your interest, I'm slightly flexible with my initial price."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your counteroffer, but my budget remains fixed at $800000. That's the maximum I can offer for the product. Please let me know if you can agree to this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $800,000 matches the minimum value I have for the product and also matches the offer from John, it's a fair deal. Continuing to negotiate might not yield a better result, and accepting this offer ensures I get a price that meets my minimum requirement without further risk or delay."
