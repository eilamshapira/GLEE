"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since the product is worth $15,000 to me (as I can sell it to John for that price), and I know Bob values it at $10,000, I'll start with a high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum acceptable price.

{""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 (which I can get from John), and it's even below Bob's own valuation of $10,000, I'll reject this offer. However, since I can always sell to John for $15,000, there's no reason to accept anything lower than that amount.
