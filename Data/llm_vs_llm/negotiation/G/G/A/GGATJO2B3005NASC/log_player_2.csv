"Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","In this situation, both Alice and John are offering the product at $800,000, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay. Since both offers are identical, and I need the product, I can accept either offer.

Given that Alice has already made the offer and is directly engaging with me, I'll choose to accept her offer to maintain a potentially beneficial business relationship.
