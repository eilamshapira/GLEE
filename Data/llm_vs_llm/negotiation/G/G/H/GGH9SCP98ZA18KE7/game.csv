"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $100. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate it, but $100 is a bit lower than I can accept. How about $140 for the product? It's a great value!",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $110 is still below my acceptable range. How about $135? It's a great deal for you!",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your patience, but $135 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $115, which is very close to my budget limit. If we can't agree on this price, I may need to explore other options.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your continued interest, Bob! I understand your position, but I canâ€™t go below $130. I believe this price reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,7,
