However, I'll reject the offer again and try to bring the price down further. I'll also start to consider buying from John, but I'll give Alice one more chance to come down in price.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to make a more aggressive counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to budge. Since my budget is $120, I'll offer $115, which is close to my limit. If Alice rejects this offer, I may consider buying from John.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your patience, but $135 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $115, which is very close to my budget limit. If we can't agree on this price, I may need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 115}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your continued interest, Bob! I understand your position, but I canâ€™t go below $130. I believe this price reflects the value of the product. What do you think?
