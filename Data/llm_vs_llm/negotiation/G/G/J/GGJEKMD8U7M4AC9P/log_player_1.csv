Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","I'll analyze my options:

1. Accept Bob's offer of $90: This is $10 more than John's offer of $80, so it's better than option 3.
2. Reject and make a counteroffer: Bob has shown willingness to pay $90, so there's a chance I could negotiate a bit higher.
3. Sell to John for $80: This is the least profitable option.

Since Bob is willing to pay $90, which is already above my minimum threshold of $80, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a better outcome, I'll accept his offer.
