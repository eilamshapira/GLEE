Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, Bob, let's talk business. I'm willing to offer you the product for **$1,400,000**. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","This is a tough one. $900,000 is more than my minimum, but much less than I'd like. I'm going to try to get more from Bob.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, Bob, I appreciate the offer, but I think we can do better. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to lower my price, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at **$1,250,000**?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1250000 is still a bit steep for me. I can go up to $1000000. Is that something you can work with?
