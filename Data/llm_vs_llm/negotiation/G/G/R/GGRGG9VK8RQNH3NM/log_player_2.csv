"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $80 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $150
3. John is offering the same product for $80
4. If I accept Alice's offer, I'll pay $150
5. If I buy from John, I'll pay $80

Since:
- Alice's offer ($150) is significantly higher than my maximum value ($80)
- John's offer ($80) matches my maximum value
- Both options get me the same product
- I want to save as much money as possible

The logical choice is to buy from John for $80, saving $70 compared to Alice's offer.
