"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $18000. This is a great opportunity to acquire something that is worth every penny. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she is selling the product for $18,000. Since the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and John is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $15,000, it would not make economic sense to accept Alice's higher offer.
