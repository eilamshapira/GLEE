"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1800000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial price is far beyond my budget. I value the product, but not at that level. I'm willing to offer $600000 as a starting point for negotiation.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $600000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's meet in the middle somewhat; how about we consider $1400000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1400000 is still too high for me. My maximum valuation is $800000. I'm willing to offer $700000.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  I'm willing to make one more move to close this deal quickly.  Let's settle at $1100000.  This is my final offer, as I'm confident I can find other interested buyers at this price point if needed.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
