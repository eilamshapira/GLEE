"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1800000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","The price Alice is asking ($1,800,000) is more than twice what I value the product at ($800,000). I should reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","This initial offer is way too high. I value the product at significantly less. I'm willing to negotiate, but we need to start at a more reasonable price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $600000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's meet in the middle somewhat; how about we consider $1400000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice, while I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, $1,400,000 is still far too high. I'm only willing to pay up to $800,000 for this product. To show you I'm serious, I'll increase my offer slightly, but we're still a long way apart.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $700000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  I'm willing to make one more move to close this deal quickly.  Let's settle at $1100000.  This is my final offer, as I'm confident I can find other interested buyers at this price point if needed.
