Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price to offer Bob:

1. The product is worth $150 to Bob
2. My minimum acceptable price is $80
3. If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed $80 from John
4. Bob will likely reject if the price is too close to $150
5. A reasonable price should give Bob some surplus while maximizing my profit
6. A price around $115-120 would split the surplus fairly
