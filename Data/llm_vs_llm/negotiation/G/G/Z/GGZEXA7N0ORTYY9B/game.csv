"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad we can continue negotiating. While $1200000 is a fair offer, I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a reasonable price, considering we're both trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I see that we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. While $1400000 is a reasonable offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1650000. This is a compromise between your offer and my previous one, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, $1650000 is still a bit above what I'm willing to pay. Considering John is offering the same product for $1500000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1450000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement soon.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your honesty about the market price, but I'd like to clarify that John's offer is actually $1200000, not $1500000. Considering this, I believe my product is worth more than what you're offering. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1550000. This is a compromise between your offer and my previous one, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
