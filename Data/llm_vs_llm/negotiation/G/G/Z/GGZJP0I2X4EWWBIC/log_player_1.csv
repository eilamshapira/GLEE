Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you, Alice, for the offer. However, I was looking to spend a bit less. Would you consider selling the product for $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us while aiming to get as much value as possible for the product."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you, Bob, for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $10,000. I can offer a slight discount from my initial price, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. How about we settle for $10500? This way, we both give a little and take a little. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'll make another counteroffer, trying to inch closer to my target price while considering Bob's willingness to negotiate. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. {""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10750. This is as low as I can comfortably go while still feeling like I'm getting a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 10750}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10750.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're almost there. How about we split the difference once more and settle at $10625? This way, we both walk away feeling like we've gotten a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $10,625 is very close to my last counteroffer of $10,750, and at this point, I believe it's a fair price considering the negotiations we've had. Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal and ensures I receive a good value for the product, which is higher than the minimum I was willing to accept from John."
