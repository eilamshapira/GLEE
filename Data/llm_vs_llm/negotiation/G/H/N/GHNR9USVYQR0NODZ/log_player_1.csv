Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my options carefully. I have a product that is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I already have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price. Bob values the product at only $800,000, which is below my minimum acceptable value.

Since I can already sell to John for $1,500,000, and that amount is higher than what Bob values the product at, there's no price point that would both be acceptable to me and attractive to Bob. Any price I offer to Bob would either be below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000 (which would cause me to lose money compared to selling to John), or it would be above $800,000 (which is more than the product is worth to Bob, so he would reject it).

The rational decision is to simply proceed with my guaranteed sale to John.
