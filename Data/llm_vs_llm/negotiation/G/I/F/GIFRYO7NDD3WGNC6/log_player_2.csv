"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($15,000), and I have the option to buy the product from John for the same price, I don't see any benefit in accepting Alice's offer at this point. I'd like to try to negotiate a better price with Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, to see how much room there is for negotiation. Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, I'll aim for a price that's closer to that value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but it's a step in the right direction. Since I know the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, I believe there's still room for further negotiation.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to make a more reasonable counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 2, I offered $8,000, which was rejected by Alice. Now, Alice has come back with an offer of $13,000. To try to meet in the middle, I'll increase my previous offer by a significant amount, but still keep it below Alice's current offer.
