"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer is $950,000
2. The product is worth $800,000 to Alice
3. My maximum value is $1,000,000
4. John's fixed price is $1,000,000

Alice's current offer ($950,000) is lower than John's price ($1,000,000), but it's still quite high considering the product is worth $800,000 to Alice. Since Alice has significant room for negotiation ($150,000 difference between her offer and her value), I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. Even if negotiations fail, I can always fall back to John's offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that:
1. The product is worth $800,000 to Alice
2. Alice's initial offer was $950,000
3. I want to leave room for negotiation but also show I'm serious

I'll offer a price that splits the difference between Alice's cost ($800,000) and her initial offer ($950,000), but slightly favoring my side to leave room for negotiation:

{""product_price"": 850000}

This offer:
- Gives Alice a $50,000 profit
- Is $100,000 less than her initial offer
- Leaves room for negotiation
- Is significantly better than John's price of $1,000,000
- Is a reasonable starting point that shows I'm serious but expect some negotiation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze this new situation:

1. Alice's initial offer was $950,000
2. I countered with $850,000
3. Alice has now come down to $900,000
4. The product is worth $800,000 to Alice
5. John's price remains at $1,000,000

This is a good development:
- Alice has reduced her price by $50,000
- The current offer is $100,000 less than John's price
- Alice has shown willingness to negotiate
- The price is still $100,000 above Alice's value

While I could try to negotiate further, there's some risk in pushing too hard. Alice has made a significant concession, and $900,000 is a reasonable price (better than John's by $100,000). Further negotiation might risk losing this good offer, and the potential gains from additional negotiation rounds might not be worth the risk.
