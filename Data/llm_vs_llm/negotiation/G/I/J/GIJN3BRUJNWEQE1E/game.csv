Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you. I believe it would be valuable for you. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $150?,150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $150 is a bit too steep for me right now. Would you consider selling it for $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $75 is too low for the quality of this product. I understand that $150 might have been high for you, so I can offer it at $125. This is a fair price considering the product's value.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. I'm still hesitant at $125 though. I was hoping to stay closer to $100. Would you meet me in the middle at $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
