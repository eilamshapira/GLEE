Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you. I believe it would be valuable for you. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $150?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $150 is a bit too steep for me right now. Would you consider selling it for $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $75 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100, so I'll reject it and make a counteroffer. Since Bob thought $150 was too steep but made a counteroffer, there's likely room for negotiation between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $75 is too low for the quality of this product. I understand that $150 might have been high for you, so I can offer it at $125. This is a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. I'm still hesitant at $125 though. I was hoping to stay closer to $100. Would you meet me in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob is only willing to pay $100, which is the same amount John is offering, I'll sell to John. There's no indication that Bob will go higher, and continuing the negotiation might risk losing both opportunities. John's offer is guaranteed and matches my minimum acceptable price."
