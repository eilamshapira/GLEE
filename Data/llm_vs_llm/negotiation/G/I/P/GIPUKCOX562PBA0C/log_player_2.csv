"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice offers the product for $150
2. The product is worth $150 to me (Bob)
3. John is willing to sell it for $150
4. My goal is to save money

In this case, all options lead to paying $150 for the product:
- Accepting Alice's offer: Pay $150
- Buying from John: Pay $150
- Rejecting without buying from anyone: Not a good option as I need the product

Since the prices are identical and I need the product, I might as well accept Alice's offer as it's the most straightforward option.
