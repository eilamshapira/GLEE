"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
2. Alice's offer ($15,000) is significantly higher than my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $10,000

The logical choice is to reject Alice's offer since it's well above both my maximum value and John's price. While I could make a counteroffer, there's no reason to pay more than $10,000 when I can get it from John at that price.
