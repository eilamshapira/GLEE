"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you my product for $100. I believe it's a great value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer of $100 is less than my maximum budget of $120, and I want to save as much money as possible, I will consider this a good deal.
