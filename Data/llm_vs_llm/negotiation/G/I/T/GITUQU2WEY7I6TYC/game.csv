"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60, considering I can get a similar product from John for $80.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must consider the product's value and the current market conditions. Given that you mentioned a similar product from John for $80, I'm willing to make a concession, but $60 is still below my expectations. Here's a revised offer.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering John's offer of $80, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. I'd like to propose $70.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than $70. Considering we're getting closer to a mutually acceptable price, I'm willing to make another concession. Here's a revised offer that's closer to the midpoint between our previous prices.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for continuing to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the concession to $90, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Since we're getting closer, I'd like to propose a price that's slightly above my previous offer, but still below your current price. How about $75?",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually acceptable price. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than $75. Considering we're very close to a deal, I'm willing to make another small concession. Here's a revised offer that's closer to your price, but still reflects the product's value.",85.0,Alice,7,
