Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Considering my goal is to earn as much money as possible, and the product is worth at least $80 to me:

I choose to **reject** Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Given the options:

*   Accepting $110 is better than selling to John for $80.
*   I still have some room to negotiate, but the difference between $110 and $130 (my last offer) is getting smaller.

I will **AcceptOffer** to secure the deal.
