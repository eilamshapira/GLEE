"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand that you believe the product has exceptional value, but my budget for this product is limited. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000, considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $2200000, considering its value and the fact that I have other interested buyers. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to this price point.",2200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you have other interested buyers, but I'm still not comfortable with a price as high as $2200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. I'd like to propose a price of $1600000.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
