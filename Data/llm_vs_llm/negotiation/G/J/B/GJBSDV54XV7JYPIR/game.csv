"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm afraid I couldn't go as low as $60. However, I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. How about we meet at $100?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $100 is still a bit high for me. Could we settle on $70 instead?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid to $70. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but not too much. How about we settle on $110?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your latest offer. I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $110 is still beyond what I can spend. How about we try $75? That's a bit higher than my last offer but still within my budget.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're really keen on the product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I have to be honest, $75 is still a bit too low for me. I can offer it to you for $105, which is a significant compromise on my part. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, $105 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $80, which is my maximum. If this works for you, let's finalize the deal.",80.0,Bob,8,
