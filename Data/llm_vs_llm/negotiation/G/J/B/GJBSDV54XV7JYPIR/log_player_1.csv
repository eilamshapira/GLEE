"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price. Since Bob is interested in the product but thinks $120 is too high, and his offer of $60 is too low for me, I'll try to meet him halfway. My next offer will be $100."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $100 is still a bit high for me. Could we settle on $70 instead? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since he's willing to increase his offer from $60 to $70, it shows he's interested in the product. However, $70 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to compromise again, but not go too low. My next offer will be $110."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid to $70. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but not too much. How about we settle on $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your latest offer. I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $110 is still beyond what I can spend. How about we try $75? That's a bit higher than my last offer but still within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since he's increasing his offer again, it shows he's really interested in the product. However, $75 is still quite far from my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to meet him a bit more than halfway this time, but I won't go below $100. My next offer will be $105, and if he rejects this, I might consider selling to John. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I see you're really keen on the product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I have to be honest, $75 is still a bit too low for me.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, $105 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $80, which is my maximum. If this works for you, let's finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob's maximum offer is $80, which is below my minimum acceptable price, and I have the option to sell the product to John for $120, it makes more sense to sell it to John. This way, I can ensure I get a price that meets my requirements without having to continue negotiating with Bob."
