Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to offer a price that Bob will accept while maximizing my earnings.

The product is worth $120 to Bob, so any price below that would give him positive value. However, I already have a guaranteed $80 from John if Bob rejects.

I want to balance between being too aggressive (risking rejection) and too conservative (leaving money on the table). Since Bob's maximum value is $120, I'll offer a price that gives both of us some benefit from the transaction.
