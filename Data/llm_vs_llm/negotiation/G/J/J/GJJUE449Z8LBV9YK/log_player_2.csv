"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given the situation:

*   **My Valuation:** $1,200,000 (Maximum I'm willing to pay)
*   **Alice's Valuation:** $800,000
*   **Alice's Offer:** $1,100,000
*   **John's Offer:** $1,200,000

**Analysis:**

I should analyze the options:

1.  **Accept Alice's offer:** This would mean buying the product for $1,100,000. This is acceptable because it is below my maximum valuation of $1,200,000.
2.  **Reject Alice's offer:** I can make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate. This is an option to consider.
3.  **Buy from John:** This would mean buying the product for $1,200,000, which is my maximum acceptable price.

**Decision:**

I should reject the offer because the price is high. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate and get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, I will make a counteroffer to Alice. My goal is to get the best possible price while still acquiring the product. Since Alice's valuation is $800,000, I want to aim for a price that is significantly lower than her initial offer of $1,100,000.

  ""product_price"": 950000
