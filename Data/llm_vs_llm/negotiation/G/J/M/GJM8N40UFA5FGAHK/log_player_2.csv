"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $150
   - This is above my maximum value of $100
   - Would result in a loss of value for me

2. Reject Alice's offer
   - This allows me to consider John's offer

3. Buy from John at $100
   - This price equals my maximum value
   - This is a better deal than Alice's offer
   - Guaranteed availability of the product

Since Alice's price ($150) is above my maximum value ($100), and John offers the product at exactly $100, the rational choice is to buy from John.
