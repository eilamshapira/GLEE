"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $180. This is a fair price considering its features and value.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $180 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know the market value, and I can actually get this same product from another seller for $150. Since I value your business relationship, I'd like to offer you $130 for the product. This way we both benefit from the transaction - you make a sale and I get a reasonable price.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is below my minimum acceptable price. While I understand you can get it elsewhere for $150, I can actually sell it to another buyer for that price as well. However, I value building a business relationship with you, so I'm willing to come down to $165. This is still a good deal as it saves you the time and effort of finding another seller.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $165 is still more than I can justify spending. The product is worth $150 to me at most, which happens to be the same price John is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. I can offer you $140, which gives you a quick sale without me having to go to another seller. If we can't reach an agreement close to this price, I'll unfortunately need to purchase from John instead.",140.0,Bob,4,
