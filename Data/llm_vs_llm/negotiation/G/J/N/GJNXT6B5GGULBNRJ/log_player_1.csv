"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $180. This is a fair price considering its features and value."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $180 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know the market value, and I can actually get this same product from another seller for $150. Since I value your business relationship, I'd like to offer you $130 for the product. This way we both benefit from the transaction - you make a sale and I get a reasonable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $130 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and while I could sell to John right now for $150, I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is below my minimum acceptable price. While I understand you can get it elsewhere for $150, I can actually sell it to another buyer for that price as well. However, I value building a business relationship with you, so I'm willing to come down to $165. This is still a good deal as it saves you the time and effort of finding another seller."", ""product_price"": 165}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $165 is still more than I can justify spending. The product is worth $150 to me at most, which happens to be the same price John is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. I can offer you $140, which gives you a quick sale without me having to go to another seller. If we can't reach an agreement close to this price, I'll unfortunately need to purchase from John instead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob has clearly stated that he won't pay more than $150 (which is his maximum value for the product), and his current offer is $140, it's best to take the guaranteed $150 from John. There's no point in continuing negotiations as Bob has revealed his maximum price point, which matches John's offer. By selling to John now, I secure the better price and avoid spending more time in negotiations that are unlikely to yield a better outcome."
