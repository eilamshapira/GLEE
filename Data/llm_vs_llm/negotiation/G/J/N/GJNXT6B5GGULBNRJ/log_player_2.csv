"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $180. This is a fair price considering its features and value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice is offering the product for $180, which is above my maximum value of $150. The product is only worth $150 to me, so paying $180 would result in a loss. Fortunately, I can buy the same product from John for $150, which aligns exactly with my maximum value.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $180 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know the market value, and I can actually get this same product from another seller for $150. Since I value your business relationship, I'd like to offer you $130 for the product. This way we both benefit from the transaction - you make a sale and I get a reasonable price."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is below my minimum acceptable price. While I understand you can get it elsewhere for $150, I can actually sell it to another buyer for that price as well. However, I value building a business relationship with you, so I'm willing to come down to $165. This is still a good deal as it saves you the time and effort of finding another seller. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has come down to $165, but that's still above the $150 maximum value the product has to me. Since I can buy the exact same product from John for $150, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay, it makes economic sense to reject Alice's offer again.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $165 is still more than I can justify spending. The product is worth $150 to me at most, which happens to be the same price John is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. I can offer you $140, which gives you a quick sale without me having to go to another seller. If we can't reach an agreement close to this price, I'll unfortunately need to purchase from John instead."", ""product_price"": 140}"
