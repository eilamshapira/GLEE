"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is too high for me. This product would be very useful to me, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $17500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12500. I believe that's a fair compromise considering the value this product holds for me and the current market.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $12500. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16000, considering the product's value and our ongoing negotiation. I believe this price is more reflective of the product's worth and is a fair compromise for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we seem to be getting closer.  I'll offer you $14000 to get this done.  That's a fair price that allows me to acquire the product while recognizing its value to you.",14000.0,Bob,6,
