"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is too high for me. This product would be very useful to me, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us. My next offer will be $17,500. This is still below my initial offer but higher than Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate while also trying to get a better price. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $17,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 17500}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12500. I believe that's a fair compromise considering the value this product holds for me and the current market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since he's willing to increase his offer to $12,500, I'll try to meet him closer to the middle while still aiming for a higher price. My next offer will be $16,000. This shows that I'm willing to continue negotiating and find a mutually beneficial price.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $12,500. I appreciate your willingness to compromise.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we seem to be getting closer.  I'll offer you $14000 to get this done.  That's a fair price that allows me to acquire the product while recognizing its value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to but still less than the $15,000 that John is willing to pay, and considering that I've been trying to get a higher price from Bob, it seems more beneficial to sell the product to John for $15,000. This ensures I get at least the minimum value I'm willing to accept for the product without further negotiation."
