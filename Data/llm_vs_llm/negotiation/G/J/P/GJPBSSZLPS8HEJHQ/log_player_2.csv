"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price of $180 is above my maximum value of $150, so I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to Alice. Since I can always buy from John at $150, there's no reason to accept any price higher than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 120}

I'll offer $120. This is below John's price of $150, giving me some savings if Alice accepts, but still reasonable given that the product is worth $150 to Alice. If Alice rejects this, I can always buy from John at $150, so I have nothing to lose by trying to negotiate a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $160 because it's still above John's price of $150. There's no reason for me to pay more than $150 when I have that as a guaranteed option with John. I'll make another counteroffer to try to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 130}

I'll increase my offer to $130. This is still below John's price of $150, which would give me some savings if Alice accepts. It's also a reasonable increase from my previous offer of $120, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still trying to get a good deal. Since the product is worth $150 to Alice, this offer would still give her a reasonable profit while saving me money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice is still offering a price ($155) that's higher than John's price ($150), and she hasn't shown willingness to go below $150 after several rounds of negotiation, it's best to take John's guaranteed offer of $150. There's no reason to pay more than $150 or continue negotiating when we have a better option readily available."
