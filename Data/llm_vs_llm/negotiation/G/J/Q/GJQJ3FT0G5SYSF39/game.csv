,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is significantly more than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can actually get the same product from another seller for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if the price is reasonable. I can offer you $80 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in doing business with me. While I understand budget constraints, I can't let the product go for $80. How about we meet halfway at $170? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice, but $170 is still well above what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, I can get this same product from John for $100, and that's really the maximum I'm willing to pay. To give you my business instead, I could offer you $90, which saves me a bit but gives you the sale. How does that sound?",90.0,Bob,4,
