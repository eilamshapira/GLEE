Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is significantly more than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can actually get the same product from another seller for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if the price is reasonable. I can offer you $80 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice, but $170 is still well above what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, I can get this same product from John for $100, and that's really the maximum I'm willing to pay. To give you my business instead, I could offer you $90, which saves me a bit but gives you the sale. How does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
