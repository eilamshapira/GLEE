"Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a highly valuable product, something that could significantly benefit your operations. I'm confident the price I'm offering is very competitive,  but I'm also open to discussing it further.  My initial offer is $1000000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a lower price point. How about $700000? This way, I can ensure I'm staying within my budget and still acquire the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $700000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $850000. This still allows me to make a decent return on the product while giving you a good deal. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I need to keep my budget in check. Can we settle for $750000? This way, we can meet halfway, and both parties can walk away satisfied.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $825000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to cover my costs and you to acquire a valuable product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see where you're coming from, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Let's settle for $775000? This price point would allow me to comfortably acquire the product while still meeting your expectations.",775000.0,Bob,6,
