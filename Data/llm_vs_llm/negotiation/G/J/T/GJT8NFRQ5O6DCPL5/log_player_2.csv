Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $700000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $850000. This still allows me to make a decent return on the product while giving you a good deal. What do you say?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $825000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to cover my costs and you to acquire a valuable product. What do you think?
