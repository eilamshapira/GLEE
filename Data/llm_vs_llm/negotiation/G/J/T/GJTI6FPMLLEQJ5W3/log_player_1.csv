Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the perceived value, my budget for this product is significantly lower. I'd be willing to purchase it for $5000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
