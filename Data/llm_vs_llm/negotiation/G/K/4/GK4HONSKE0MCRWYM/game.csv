"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product looks great, $200 is a bit over my budget. I'd be willing to buy it for $100.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $100 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for a lower price than my initial offer.",180.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I'm still a little ways off though. How about $120?",120.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair value for the product. Let's meet in the middle between my last offer and your current one.",160.0,Alice,5,

Thanks Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  How does $140 sound?,140.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. Considering we're close, I'm willing to make a small concession. Let's do $145, and we can call it a deal.",145.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, $145 is close, but I'm really trying to stay closer to $140.  How about we split the difference and call it $142.50?",142.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're really close now. I appreciate your creative suggestion to split the difference. However, I'm still slightly above that price in my mind. Let's try to find a middle ground between your $142.50 and my previous $145. How about $143.75?",143.75,Alice,9,
