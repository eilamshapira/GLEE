"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given that I'm looking for a product worth no more than $12,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $12,000, Alice's offer of $15,000 is too high. It doesn't make sense for me to pay more than what the product is worth to me.

Since Alice's offer is $3,000 higher than my maximum valuation, I should either try to negotiate with Alice or go with John's guaranteed offer of $12,000.

In this case, since I know I can get the product at my maximum valuation from John, and there's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower counteroffer, the rational choice is:
