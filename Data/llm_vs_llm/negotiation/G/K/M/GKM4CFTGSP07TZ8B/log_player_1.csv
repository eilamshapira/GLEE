Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, the price is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to purchase the product for $800000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price. My counteroffer will be $1,800,000. This is still below my initial offer but higher than Bob's counteroffer, indicating a willingness to negotiate while aiming for the best possible price. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that my initial price might have been a bit steep. However, considering the product's value, I'm willing to adjust my price slightly. I can offer it to you for $1,800,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $1800000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm prepared to go up to $900000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since Bob has increased his offer to $900,000, I'll slightly decrease my price to encourage a sale, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. My next counteroffer will be $1,600,000.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I see you're serious about purchasing the product, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $1600000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950000. This is the best I can do at the moment. Let me know if you can accept this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob's best offer is $950,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable price and significantly lower than what John is willing to pay ($1,500,000), it makes more sense to sell the product to John. This ensures I get a better price for the product, closer to its actual value to me."
