"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

{""product_price"": 1,400,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","$1,200,000 is a good offer - it's well above my minimum value of $1,000,000, and while it's less than Bob's full value ($1,500,000), it represents a fair split of the surplus. Given that we could spend several more rounds negotiating with the risk of ending up with a worse deal, I'll accept this offer.
