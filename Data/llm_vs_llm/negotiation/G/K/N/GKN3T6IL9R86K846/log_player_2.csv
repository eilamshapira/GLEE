"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000 is close to my maximum budget of $1,500,000 but still below it, and considering I have 10 rounds to negotiate, I think I can try to get a better deal. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to negotiate a lower price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice's initial offer was $1,400,000 and considering her reserve price is $1,000,000, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than her initial offer but still reasonable, to leave room for further negotiation. A good starting point could be somewhere in the middle between Alice's reserve price and her initial offer.

My counteroffer would be $1,200,000.
