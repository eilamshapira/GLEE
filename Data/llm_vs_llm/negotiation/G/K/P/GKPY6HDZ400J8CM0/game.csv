"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking at a budget-friendly purchase. How about I buy the product for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I need to get at least $100 for the product to make it worth my while. How about we settle at $100?",100.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a budget-friendly option. Let's meet in the middle. How about $105 for the product? It's a fair price considering its value.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for considering my budget, Alice. I believe $95 would be a fair price for both of us. Would you be willing to accept that?",95.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Let's try to close the gap a bit more. How about we agree on $100? It's a round number and should work well for both of us.",100.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're close to reaching an agreement. Let's make it $102.50. It's just a bit more than your last offer and still within a reasonable range for both of us. What do you say?",102.5,Alice,5,
