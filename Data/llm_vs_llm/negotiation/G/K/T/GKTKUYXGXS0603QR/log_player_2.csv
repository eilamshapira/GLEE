"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer ($12,000) is higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept it. While I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, I already have a guaranteed option to buy from John at my maximum value. Therefore, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
