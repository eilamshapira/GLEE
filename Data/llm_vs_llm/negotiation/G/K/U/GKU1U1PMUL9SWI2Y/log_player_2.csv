"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price of $180 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $120. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to Alice, as I might be able to negotiate a better price. If we can't reach an agreement, I can always fall back to John's offer of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 100}

I'll start with a lower offer of $100. This gives room for negotiation while still being a reasonable price considering that:
1. The product is worth $150 to Alice
2. My maximum acceptable price is $120
3. I have John's offer of $120 as a backup

If Alice rejects this offer, we can potentially meet somewhere in the middle, but I won't go above $120 since that's my maximum value and I have John's offer as an alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John for $120 because:
1. Alice's new offer of $170 is still well above my maximum value of $120
2. Alice only reduced her price by $10 from her initial offer of $180, suggesting she's not willing to make significant price reductions
3. John's price of $120 exactly matches my maximum value
4. Further negotiation rounds with Alice might not lead to a better price than John's offer

There's no reason to continue negotiating when I can get the product at my maximum acceptable price right now from John."
