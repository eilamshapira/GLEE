"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product that I think you'll really love. It's a one-time offer, so please consider it carefully. If you're interested, please let me know and we can finalize the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $99
3. John will sell it for $100
4. Alice's cost is $80, so there might be room for negotiation

Given that:
- Alice's offer ($99) is only $1 less than John's price ($100)
- The offer seems high considering Alice's cost ($80)
- There's no mention that this is the final negotiation round

I should reject Alice's offer in hopes of getting a better price, knowing I can always fall back on John's $100 offer.
