"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($10,000), and I have the option to buy the same product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in accepting Alice's offer immediately. However, I also don't want to give up on the potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable considering the product's value to me. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a relatively low offer.

{""product_price"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $9,000 is a step in the right direction, but it's still higher than I'd like to pay. Since I know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Accepting the offer of $9,000 would save me $1,000 compared to buying from John, but I'm aiming to save more.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer, trying to bring the price closer to my target.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's previous offer was $9,000 and she rejected my offer of $5,000, I'll try to meet her halfway and make a more reasonable counteroffer. I'll increase my previous offer to $6,500, which is still below Alice's last offer but shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price.

{""product_price"": 6500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $8,500 is getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with, and it's also close to the value the product holds for her, which is $8,000. Given that I know she's willing to sell it for at least $8,000, I believe $8,500 is a reasonable price, especially considering I can buy it from John for $10,000.

Accepting this offer would save me $1,500 compared to buying from John, which is a significant savings. Since we're already at round 5 and I don't want to risk Alice pulling out of the negotiation or not being willing to go lower, I'll accept her offer.
