,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Given market conditions and my budget, I can offer $60 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for me.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the product's value and current market prices, I'd be willing to go down to $120.  Let me know if this works for you.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice, but $120 is still more than I can justify spending. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $80, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $70, which would save me a bit while still giving you a fair price.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $70 is simply too far below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $90? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to work with you.",90.0,Alice,5,
