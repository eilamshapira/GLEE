"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $200 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price of $200 is way above my maximum value of $80. Since I can always buy from John for $80, there's no reason to accept such a high price. I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Given market conditions and my budget, I can offer $60 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for me."", ""product_price"": 60}

I'm offering $60 which is below John's price of $80, giving me room to negotiate upward if needed while still potentially saving money compared to buying from John. This also allows Alice to counter with a price that might work for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the product's value and current market prices, I'd be willing to go down to $120.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price of $120 is still well above both my maximum value ($80) and John's offer ($80). Since I can always buy from John for $80, there's no reason to accept $120. I'll reject and make another counteroffer to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice, but $120 is still more than I can justify spending. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $80, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $70, which would save me a bit while still giving you a fair price."", ""product_price"": 70}

I'm offering $70 which is slightly below John's price of $80. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and reveals that I have an alternative option at $80. This might encourage her to meet me at a price below $80 if she wants to make the sale, while still giving me some savings compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $70 is simply too far below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $90? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer of $90 is still above John's price of $80, and I value the product at no more than $80, it makes the most sense to buy from John. Alice seems unwilling to go below $90, and continuing to negotiate would likely not result in a better price than John's offer. Therefore, I'll take the guaranteed $80 price from John."
