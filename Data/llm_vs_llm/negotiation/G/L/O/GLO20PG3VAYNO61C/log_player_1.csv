"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product and I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start by making a high offer. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially settle on a higher price than if I started with a lower offer.

{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is higher than the minimum value of $800,000 that I'm willing to accept, and it's only Round 2, I think I can try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $900,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than my initial offer of $1,200,000 but still higher than Bob's offer. This will show that I'm willing to negotiate and compromise.

{""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is getting closer to what I had in mind, and it's a significant increase from his previous offer. Considering we're only in Round 4, I think I can still try to squeeze out a bit more, but I also don't want to risk losing the deal.

However, since Bob's offer is already at $1,000,000, which is a good price, I'll think carefully before making my next move. Given that I can sell the product to John for $800,000, Bob's offer is significantly better.
