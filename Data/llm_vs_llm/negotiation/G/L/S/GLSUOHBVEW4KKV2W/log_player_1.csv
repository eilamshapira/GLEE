"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1200000 is far beyond my budget. Based on my assessment, the maximum value I can place on this product is $600000. This is my initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I will sell to John instead. Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and since I know John is willing to pay $1,000,000, there's no reason to continue negotiations with Bob when his initial counteroffer is so far below my reservation price."
