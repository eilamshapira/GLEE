# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1200000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","The initial offer is $1,200,000, which is significantly above my valuation of $800,000. I will reject the offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round if I believe there's a chance to negotiate a lower price. Buying from John is an option I'll keep in mind.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice's initial offer is way too high. I need to anchor the negotiation with a much lower price, reflecting my valuation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,200,000 is far beyond my budget. Based on my assessment, the maximum value I can place on this product is $600,000. This is my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
