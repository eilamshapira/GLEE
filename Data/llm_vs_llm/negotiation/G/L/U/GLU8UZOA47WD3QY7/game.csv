,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for this product, which is a fair price considering my value for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, this product has considerable value. How about we agree on $18000? I believe this is a reasonable middle ground considering the quality of the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your understanding of my budget, $18000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10000 for this product, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. To make this deal beneficial for both of us, how about I lower my price to $16000? This is the best I can offer, considering the product's significant value.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be fair here, but $16000 is simply too high. I'm prepared to pay $12000, which is a generous compromise considering the value I place on this product.  I hope you can meet me halfway.",12000.0,Bob,6,
