"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $18000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $6000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your position, but $6000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14000? This feels like a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14000 is still too high for me. My maximum budget is $7000. I can offer you $7000 right now.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $7000 is still quite low, I'm seeing if we can find some common ground. Could you consider $11000? I'm significantly reducing my asking price to try and make this work.",11000.0,Alice,5,
