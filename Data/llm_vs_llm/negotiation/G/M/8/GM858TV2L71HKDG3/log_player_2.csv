"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","The offer from Alice is $200, which is more than the $100 that the product is worth to me. Since John is willing to sell the same product for $100, which matches the maximum I'm willing to pay, it doesn't make sense to accept Alice's higher price or to continue negotiating when I already have a guaranteed option at my maximum price point.
