"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that Bob values the product at $120, and I can always sell it to John for $150, I should start with a higher price and see if Bob is willing to negotiate.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Given that Bob's offer of $100 is well below both my minimum acceptable price ($150) and even below his own valuation ($120), I should reject this offer. Since I can always sell to John for $150, there's no reason to accept an offer below that amount.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's initial offer was quite low at $100, I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still keep it above my minimum threshold of $150.

{""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer of $110 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and given that I have John's guaranteed offer of $150, there's no reason to accept this low offer. Since Bob's counter-offers are still quite low and we're already in round 4, it might be best to end the negotiation and take John's offer.
