Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob
2. I won't accept less than $1,200,000 (my reservation price)
3. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $1,200,000
4. Bob would only accept if the price is less than or equal to $1,500,000
5. Bob would likely want some surplus from the deal

I should price it high enough to maximize my profit but low enough that Bob would still accept. If I price it too close to $1,500,000, Bob might reject it. A price of $1,400,000 would give Bob a $100,000 surplus while giving me a significant premium over my alternative option (John's offer).
