Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer increased from $60 to $70, it shows that he's willing to negotiate. I'll try to find a balance between my initial offer and Bob's increasing offers.

At this point, I'm starting to think that Bob might not be willing to meet my minimum value, and I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120. However, I'll give Bob one more chance to increase his offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, but if Bob's next offer is not significantly higher, I might consider selling to John.
