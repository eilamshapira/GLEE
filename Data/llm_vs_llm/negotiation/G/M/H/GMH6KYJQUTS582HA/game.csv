"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. Based on my research and budget, I can offer $6000 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for me.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your response, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but $6000 is quite below the value of the product. How about I offer you a new price of $18000? I truly believe this product will exceed your expectations. Let me know your thoughts!",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $18000 is still far above my budget. I want to be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $8000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a middle ground. I can increase my offer to $7000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer. Would this work for you?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, $7000 is still too low for me. How about we meet halfway? I can offer you the product for $16500. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think!",16500.0,Alice,5,
