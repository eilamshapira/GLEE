Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. Based on my research and budget, I can offer $6000 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your response, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is quite below the value of the product.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $18000 is still far above my budget. I want to be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $8000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a middle ground. I can increase my offer to $7000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer. Would this work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
