"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I'm asking for $20000. I believe it will provide you with amazing value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $20,000 is way above my maximum value of $8,000. It's not a reasonable starting point since it's more than twice what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations don't progress well, I always have the option to buy from John at $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20,000 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. Based on my research and budget, I can offer $6,000 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for me."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but $6000 is quite below the value of the product. How about I offer you a new price of $18000? I truly believe this product will exceed your expectations. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has only dropped the price by $2,000, from $20,000 to $18,000, which is still more than twice my maximum value of $8,000. Since she made such a small concession and is still far above even John's price of $8,000, I'll reject this offer and try another counteroffer. If Alice continues to stay at these high price levels, I may need to consider buying from John instead."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $18,000 is still far above my budget. I want to be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $8,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a middle ground. I can increase my offer to $7,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, $7000 is still too low for me. How about we meet halfway? I can offer you the product for $16500. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

After several rounds of negotiation, it's clear that Alice and I have very different value assessments for this product. She started at $20,000 and has only come down to $16,500, which is still more than double my maximum value of $8,000. She also seems to be making relatively small concessions despite me informing her about the alternative offer from John.

Since Alice's price is still more than twice what John is asking, and she doesn't seem likely to come down to a price near my maximum value of $8,000, it makes the most economic sense to end the negotiation and purchase from John for $8,000. This way, I get the product at my maximum acceptable price without wasting more time in negotiations that are unlikely to succeed."
