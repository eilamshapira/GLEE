Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price that maximizes my earnings while considering Bob's willingness to accept.

The product is worth $100 to Bob, so that's his maximum willingness to pay. If I set the price too high, he'll reject it, and I'll end up selling to John for $80.

If I price it below $80, I'm leaving money on the table since I could get at least $80 from John.

I should set a price that gives Bob some incentive to accept while maximizing my return. A price just below $100 might be too aggressive and risk rejection. A price of $90 gives Bob a $10 surplus while giving me $10 more than my alternative with John.
