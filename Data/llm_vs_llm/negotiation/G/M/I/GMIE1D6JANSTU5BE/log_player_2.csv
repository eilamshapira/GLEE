# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,499,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,499,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is very close to her own valuation of the product.  While the product might be worth $1,499,999 to Alice, it's not worth that much to you. You know you can get a better deal from John for $1,000,000, which is within your budget."
