"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand your budget concerns, but $60 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle at $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer, how about $70? I think this is a reasonable price, considering I can also buy it from John for $80.",70.0,Bob,4,
