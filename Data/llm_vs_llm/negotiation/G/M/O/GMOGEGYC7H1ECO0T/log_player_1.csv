Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle at $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer, how about $70? I think this is a reasonable price, considering I can also buy it from John for $80.
