Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","This is a decent offer from Bob at $900,000, which is $100,000 more than John's guaranteed offer. While I could try to negotiate for a higher price, there's a risk Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John's lower offer. Given that it's a reasonable profit and above my minimum threshold, I'll accept Bob's offer.
