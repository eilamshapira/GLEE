"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
While Alice's offer is close to your maximum budget, you can save $500 by buying from John. You're willing to pay $12,000, so it makes sense to go with the slightly more expensive option to save some money."
