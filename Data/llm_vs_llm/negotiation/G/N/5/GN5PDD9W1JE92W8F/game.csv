"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your product, I need to be mindful of my budget. I know I can get this same product from John for $80, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a better price. Would you consider selling it for $70? This would save me some money and still give you a reasonable profit considering your cost.",70.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I was thinking more along the lines of meeting in the middle between my initial offer and your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still need to make a reasonable profit. How about we settle at $85? It's still a great deal for you, and it works for me too.",85.0,Alice,3,
