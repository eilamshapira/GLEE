Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm willing to make a deal with you. Let's start with a price that I think is fair."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your product, I need to be mindful of my budget. I know I can get this same product from John for $80, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a better price. Would you consider selling it for $70? This would save me some money and still give you a reasonable profit considering your cost. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to try to get a better price. Since Bob is willing to pay up to $80, I'll try to meet him in the middle. My next offer will be $85, but I can negotiate further if needed. 

Counteroffer: $85"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I was thinking more along the lines of meeting in the middle between my initial offer and your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still need to make a reasonable profit. How about we settle at $85? It's still a great deal for you, and it works for me too."", ""product_price"": 85}"
