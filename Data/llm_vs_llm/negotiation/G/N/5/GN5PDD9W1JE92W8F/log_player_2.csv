"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm willing to make a deal with you. Let's start with a price that I think is fair. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Looking at Alice's offer, I need to evaluate if accepting her price of $100 makes sense.

Since the product is only worth $80 to me, I shouldn't pay more than that. Alice is offering it for $100, which exceeds my maximum value.

I have two reasonable options:
1) Reject and make a counteroffer to Alice
2) Buy from John at $80

Since John is willing to sell at exactly my maximum value ($80), and Alice's initial offer is above that, I should either negotiate with Alice for a better price or just go with John's guaranteed offer.

Let me reject Alice's offer so I can make a counteroffer. If negotiations don't progress favorably, I can always buy from John.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your product, I need to be mindful of my budget. I know I can get this same product from John for $80, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a better price. Would you consider selling it for $70? This would save me some money and still give you a reasonable profit considering your cost."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I was thinking more along the lines of meeting in the middle between my initial offer and your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still need to make a reasonable profit. How about we settle at $85? It's still a great deal for you, and it works for me too. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has countered with an offer of $85, which is still above my maximum value of $80. In this situation, I need to consider my options carefully:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $85 - This would mean paying $5 more than the product is worth to me
2. Reject and make another counteroffer - This could potentially get me a better price
3. Buy from John at $80 - This aligns exactly with my maximum value

Since John is offering the product at exactly $80 (which is the maximum value to me), and Alice's price is still above that, the rational choice is to go with John's offer. Even though I'd prefer to do business with Alice, I shouldn't pay more than the product is worth to me.
