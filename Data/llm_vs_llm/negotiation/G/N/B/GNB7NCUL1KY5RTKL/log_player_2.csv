"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's clear you won't get a reasonable deal starting from there. John offers a much better price, even if there's a chance you could negotiate Alice down a bit."
