Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is quite high. Let's start the negotiation at $400000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $400,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000."

I'll make another counteroffer in the next round. Although Bob has increased his offer, $500,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and I believe the product is worth more. I'll try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $850000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $600000. If you can match this price, I think we might have a deal. I can't go much higher than that.

I'll make another counteroffer in the next round. Although Bob has increased his offer to $600,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Since Bob mentioned he can't go much higher than $600,000, I'll try to make a more significant concession to see if we can meet in the middle, while still being mindful of my bottom line."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

Given that Bob's latest offer of $650,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and we're running out of rounds, I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This ensures I get a fair price for the product, and I don't risk going below my minimum acceptable price in the remaining rounds."
