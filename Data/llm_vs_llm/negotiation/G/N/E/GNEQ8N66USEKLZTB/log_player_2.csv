"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this unique and valuable item. I believe it could be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm starting the offer at $25000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering the product for $25,000, which exceeds the maximum value of $15,000 that the product is worth to me. Since John is offering the same product for $15,000, which is equal to my maximum valuation, there's no reason to pay Alice $10,000 more.

I could reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, but since I already have a guaranteed option to buy from John at my maximum valuation, the most reasonable decision is to buy from John.
