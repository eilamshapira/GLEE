Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make my first offer to Bob.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","I'll consider my options:

1. Accept Bob's offer of $105. This gives me $5 more than my minimum ($100).
2. Reject and counter. I can try to get more than $105.
3. Sell to John for $100. This is my guaranteed fallback option.

Since Bob's offer of $105 is better than my fallback option with John ($100), but I believe I can get a slightly better price since the product is worth $120 to Bob, I'll reject and counter.
