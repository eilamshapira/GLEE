"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but $120 is outside my budget. How about we start our negotiations at $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. However, $60 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to go down to $100 for this product. Let me know if that works for you!",100.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to stick closer to my initial price. How about we settle at $95? This is a good compromise, and I believe you'll find the product well worth it at this price.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still can't go that high. Would you consider selling the product for $70?",70.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is still below what I can accept. Let's meet in the middle at $85. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at this value.",85.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I need to maintain a bit more value. How about we settle at $82? This is very close to your last offer and still within a reasonable range for me.",82.0,Alice,5,
