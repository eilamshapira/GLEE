Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to choose a price that balances maximizing my revenue while having a reasonable chance of Bob accepting my offer.

Since the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price (John), I don't want to risk selling below that amount. However, I want to try to get more from Bob if possible.

I'll offer Bob a price that's higher than my minimum acceptable value, but still potentially attractive enough that he might accept it.
