"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $11500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and capabilities.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $11500 is quite steep for this product. Given the market conditions and product specifications, I would be willing to pay $9000, which I believe is a fair price that would work well for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your proposal, $9000 is too low considering the product's value. I can reduce my initial price to $10500, which is a significant reduction and represents a good value for this product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, I'm still finding $10500 to be on the higher side. I can increase my offer to $9500, which would give you a healthy profit margin while being more reasonable for my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer. To show my willingness to work with you, I can come down to $10000. This is a very competitive price considering the product's value, and it represents a significant discount from my initial offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
