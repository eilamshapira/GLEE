Send your offer to Bob.","{
    ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and capabilities."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $11500 is quite steep for this product. Given the market conditions and product specifications, I would be willing to pay $9000, which I believe is a fair price that would work well for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. $9,000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and I know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob. There's still room for negotiation.

{
    ""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your proposal, $9,000 is too low considering the product's value. I can reduce my initial price to $10,500, which is a significant reduction and represents a good value for this product."",
    ""product_price"": 10500
}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, I'm still finding $10500 to be on the higher side. I can increase my offer to $9500, which would give you a healthy profit margin while being more reasonable for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make another counteroffer. Bob has increased his offer by $500, showing willingness to negotiate. Since he moved up from $9,000 to $9,500, and knowing the product is worth $12,000 to him, there's still room for a better deal.

{
    ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer. To show my willingness to work with you, I can come down to $10,000. This is a very competitive price considering the product's value, and it represents a significant discount from my initial offer."",
