"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product at a special price of $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I believe it represents great value for what you're getting. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000
3. John is offering the same product for $1,000,000

The logical choice is to buy from John since:
- Alice's price ($1,200,000) is above my maximum value ($1,000,000)
- John's price ($1,000,000) matches my maximum value
- I would lose $200,000 by accepting Alice's offer compared to John's offer
