"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Looking at the options:

1. Alice's offer is $180
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John for $120

Since Alice's offer ($180) is higher than both the maximum I'm willing to pay ($120) and John's price ($120), the best decision is to buy from John instead.
