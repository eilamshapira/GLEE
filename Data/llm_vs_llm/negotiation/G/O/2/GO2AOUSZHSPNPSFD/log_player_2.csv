{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll offer a price that is close to my target budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice rejected my previous offer of $8,000 and came back with a price of $13,500, I'll try to meet her halfway. I'll increase my offer, but still keep it below my target budget of $10,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $12,500 is still above my target budget of $10,000. However, I can see that she's slowly coming down in price. I'll reject her offer again, but I'll also start thinking about the possibility of buying from John if the negotiations don't go in my favor soon.

For now, I'll try to make another counteroffer to see if I can get Alice to lower the price further.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice is slowly coming down in price, I'll try to meet her halfway again. My previous offer was $9,000, and her current offer is $12,500. I'll increase my offer, but still keep it below $10,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $12,000 is still above my target budget of $10,000. At this point, I'm starting to think that buying from John for $10,000 might be the better option. However, I'll give Alice one more chance to come down in price.

If I make another counteroffer, it will be very close to my maximum budget. If Alice rejects it, I'll likely buy from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice is still above my target budget, I'll make a counteroffer that is very close to my maximum budget of $10,000. I'll offer $9,800, which is a slight increase from my previous offer of $9,500. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll likely buy from John.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $11,500 is still above my target budget of $10,000, and it's actually higher than her previous offer of $12,000 was lower than this in round 7, but in round 7 it was $12,000. It seems like the negotiations are not going in my favor.

At this point, I think it's clear that buying from John for $10,000 is the better option. I've given Alice multiple chances to come down in price, and she's not willing to meet me at a reasonable price.
