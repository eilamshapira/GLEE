"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $10,000 compared to my alternatives.

The product is worth at most $8,000 to me, so paying $10,000 would actually leave me worse off by $2,000. This makes accepting Alice's current offer a poor choice.

My alternatives are:
- Make a counteroffer to Alice (which she may or may not accept)
- Buy from John immediately for $8,000

Since John's price equals exactly what the product is worth to me, I wouldn't save any money by buying from him. However, trying to negotiate with Alice might get me a better price, though it also risks wasting time if we can't reach an agreement.

Given that Alice's offer is above my maximum value, and I have a guaranteed option at my maximum value, the most rational choice is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $7,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer of $9,000.

The product is worth at most $8,000 to me, so paying $9,000 would still leave me worse off by $1,000. Alice has reduced her price, but it's still above my maximum value.

My alternatives are:
- Make another counteroffer to Alice
- Buy from John for $8,000

Since John's price of $8,000 exactly matches what the product is worth to me, I wouldn't lose any value by buying from him. Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by dropping her price, but her current offer is still not beneficial to me.

Given that Alice's offer is still above my maximum value, and I have a guaranteed option that matches my maximum value, the rational choice is:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
