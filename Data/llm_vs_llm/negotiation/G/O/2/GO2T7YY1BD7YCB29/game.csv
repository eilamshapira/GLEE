"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1800000 is well above my budget and market expectations for this product. I'm aware of similar products available in the market for much less. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600000, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions. I'm open to further discussion if this doesn't meet your expectations.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600000 is significantly below the product's true value and my minimum acceptable price. This product has unique features and benefits that distinguish it from similar products on the market. While I understand budget considerations, I can come down to $1500000, which represents a $300000 reduction from my initial offer. This is a substantial discount for a product of this caliber. I'm willing to continue our negotiation, but please note that I have other interested buyers willing to pay close to my asking price.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
