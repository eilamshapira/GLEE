Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. After careful consideration of its market value and unique benefits, I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1800000 is well above my budget and market expectations for this product. I'm aware of similar products available in the market for much less. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600000, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions. I'm open to further discussion if this doesn't meet your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600,000 is significantly below the product's true value and my minimum acceptable price. This product has unique features and benefits that distinguish it from similar products on the market. While I understand budget considerations, I can come down to $1,500,000, which represents a $300,000 reduction from my initial offer. This is a substantial discount for a product of this caliber. I'm willing to continue our negotiation, but please note that I have other interested buyers willing to pay close to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
