"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. After careful consideration of its market value and unique benefits, I'm offering it to you for $1800000. This product represents a significant opportunity, and I'm confident it will provide substantial value to you. I'm open to discussing this offer if you have any questions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll reject Alice's offer of $1,800,000 because it's significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,000,000 and even higher than John's guaranteed price of $1,000,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better deal from Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer and John's price, giving room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to John's offer.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,800,000 is well above my budget and market expectations for this product. I'm aware of similar products available in the market for much less. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600,000, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions. I'm open to further discussion if this doesn't meet your expectations."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600000 is significantly below the product's true value and my minimum acceptable price. This product has unique features and benefits that distinguish it from similar products on the market. While I understand budget considerations, I can come down to $1500000, which represents a $300000 reduction from my initial offer. This is a substantial discount for a product of this caliber. I'm willing to continue our negotiation, but please note that I have other interested buyers willing to pay close to my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,500,000 is still above both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000). Since Alice seems to be anchoring her price quite high and mentions other interested buyers, suggesting she may not be willing to drop the price significantly, it might be more efficient to simply buy from John rather than continue negotiating.
