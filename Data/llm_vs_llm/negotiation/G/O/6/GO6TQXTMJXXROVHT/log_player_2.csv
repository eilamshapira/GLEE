"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $18000. It's a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Based on the information provided:

1. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $18,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $15,000

Since Alice's offer ($18,000) exceeds both the value of the product to me ($15,000) and John's alternative offer ($15,000), the rational decision is to buy from John.
