"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's offer is for $12,000, which is both higher than the product's worth to me ($8,000) and higher than John's offer ($8,000), the rational decision would be to buy from John instead.
