"Hi Alice, $25000 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but $12000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to lower my price to $20000. Let me know if this works for you.",20000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $25000 was too high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $18000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and I believe it represents a fair value for the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's try $15000 - that's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we could come to an agreement. I accept your offer of $15000 for the product. Let's proceed with the transaction.",,Alice,4,AcceptOffer
