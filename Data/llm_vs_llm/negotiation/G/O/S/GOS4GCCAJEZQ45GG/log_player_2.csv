"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $120 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $115
3. John is willing to sell it for $120
4. If I reject Alice's offer, I'll buy from John for $120

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, I should compare the two prices:
- Alice's offer: $115
- John's price: $120

Alice's offer is $5 cheaper than John's price, so I should accept Alice's offer to save money.
