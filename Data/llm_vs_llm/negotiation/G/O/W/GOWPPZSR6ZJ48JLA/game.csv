"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be out of your budget, but $90 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'll lower my price, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for the product.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $140 is still more than I can spend. I've done some market research, and similar products are available for much less. I can increase my offer to $100, which I believe is more reasonable.",100.0,Bob,4,
