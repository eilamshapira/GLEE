"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $150 is above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $90 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll proceed to the next round to send a counteroffer, hoping to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be out of your budget, but $90 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'll lower my price, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for the product."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $140 is still more than I can spend. I've done some market research, and similar products are available for much less. I can increase my offer to $100, which I believe is more reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I accept Bob's offer of $100. Although I was initially hoping for a higher price, Bob's market research and willingness to increase his offer to $100 make it a reasonable deal. Additionally, selling to Bob for $100 is equivalent to selling to John for $100, so I might as well close the deal with Bob."
