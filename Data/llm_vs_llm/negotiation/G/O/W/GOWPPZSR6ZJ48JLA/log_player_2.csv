"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $150 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $120 and also higher than John's price. It would be reasonable to make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price before considering John's option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $150 is above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions."", ""product_price"": 90}

I'm starting with a lower offer of $90 to leave room for negotiation. This is significantly below my maximum of $120 and also below John's price, which gives me leverage in the negotiation while still being a reasonable starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be out of your budget, but $90 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'll lower my price, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice only reduced her price by $10, which is still well above both my maximum budget of $120 and John's price. Since we still have several rounds for negotiation and Alice has shown willingness to reduce the price (albeit slightly), it's worth making another counteroffer before considering John's option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $140 is still more than I can spend. I've done some market research, and similar products are available for much less. I can increase my offer to $100, which I believe is more reasonable."", ""product_price"": 100}

I'm incrementally increasing my offer by $10 to show good faith in negotiation, while still staying well below John's price of $120. This gives Alice room to continue negotiating while maintaining my position that her price is too high. If Alice doesn't come down significantly in the next round, I might consider switching to John's offer."
