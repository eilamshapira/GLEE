"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in our product. This is a premium product with exceptional value. I'm offering it to you for $3000000. This price reflects the quality and unique benefits that come with it. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $3,000,000, which is significantly above the $800,000 maximum value it has to me. John is offering the same product for $800,000, which is exactly my maximum value.

Since Alice's offer is nearly 4 times what the product is worth to me, and there's an immediately available alternative at my maximum acceptable price, the rational decision is clear.
