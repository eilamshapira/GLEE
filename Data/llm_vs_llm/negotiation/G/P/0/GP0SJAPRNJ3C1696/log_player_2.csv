"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my exclusive product for $1000000. Let me know if youâ€™d like to proceed with the purchase; if not, I'll be moving forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Based on the information provided, let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to you
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $1,000,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $800,000

Since Alice's offer ($1,000,000) exceeds the maximum value the product is worth to you ($800,000), and John is offering exactly the maximum value, the financially prudent choice is to buy from John.
