"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $110. It's a great value and I think you'll really appreciate it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $80 to me (maximum I'm willing to pay)
2. Alice is offering it for $110
3. John is willing to sell it for $80

Alice's offer ($110) is above my maximum value ($80), and it's also higher than John's price ($80). There's no reason to accept Alice's offer when I can get the same product from John for a lower price that matches my maximum value.
