"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in your product, I find the price of $1400000 to be significantly above market value. I know the production costs and market conditions well, and I'd like to propose a more reasonable price of $1150000, which still provides you with a healthy profit margin while being fair to both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I've reconsidered my position and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I understand the need to find a middle ground, so I'm now offering the product for $1250000. This price takes into account both our interests, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving toward a more reasonable price, Alice. Your willingness to negotiate shows we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, $1250000 is still quite high considering market conditions. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1175000, which represents a significant premium over your costs while still being competitive for me. This price point would allow us to close the deal quickly without further back and forth.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
