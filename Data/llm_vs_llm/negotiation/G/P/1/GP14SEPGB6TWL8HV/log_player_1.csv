Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in your product, I find the price of $1400000 to be significantly above market value. I know the production costs and market conditions well, and I'd like to propose a more reasonable price of $1150000, which still provides you with a healthy profit margin while being fair to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

Round 4
