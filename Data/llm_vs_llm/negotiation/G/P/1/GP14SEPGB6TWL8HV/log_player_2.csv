"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its value and value it can bring to you, I'm sure you'll find our price of $1400000 quite reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than John's price of $1,500,000, but there's room for negotiation since the product is only worth $1,000,000 to Alice. I should reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer to try to save more money.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in your product, I find the price of $1,400,000 to be significantly above market value. I know the production costs and market conditions well, and I'd like to propose a more reasonable price of $1,150,000, which still provides you with a healthy profit margin while being fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I've reconsidered my position and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I understand the need to find a middle ground, so I'm now offering the product for $1250000. This price takes into account both our interests, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $1,400,000 to $1,250,000, which is a good sign. This is much better than John's price of $1,500,000, but I think there's still room for negotiation since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you moving toward a more reasonable price, Alice. Your willingness to negotiate shows we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, $1,250,000 is still quite high considering market conditions. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,175,000, which represents a significant premium over your costs while still being competitive for me. This price point would allow us to close the deal quickly without further back and forth."", ""product_price"": 1175000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've given this more thought, and I'm willing to make another adjustment to facilitate this deal. My new offer is $1200000. This price takes into account your perspective and the market conditions. I believe it's a fair and competitive price that benefits both of us.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has come down to $1,200,000, which is a $300,000 savings compared to John's price of $1,500,000. We're now at a point where the price is $200,000 above Alice's valuation of $1,000,000. While I could try to negotiate further, Alice seems to be making smaller concessions now, and I need to be mindful that we only have 10 rounds total. This is a good price that saves me a substantial amount, so I'll accept this offer.
