"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is above my maximum budget of $800,000, I will reject her offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I'll offer a price that is close to my maximum budget, but leaves some room for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,050,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. While it's a slight improvement from her initial offer, it's still not acceptable to me.

I'll reject her offer again and proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer, hoping to bring the price down further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer is still quite high, I'll try to meet her halfway between her latest offer and my previous counteroffer. My previous counteroffer was $600,000, and Alice's latest offer is $1,050,000, so I'll offer a price that's roughly in the middle of those two numbers, but still a bit lower, to try to nudge her towards a more reasonable price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $950,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. At this point, I'm starting to think that Alice may not be willing to sell the product to me at a price that I'm comfortable with.

Given that I have the option to buy the product from John for $800,000, which is my maximum budget, I'm starting to think that it may be better to just buy from John instead of continuing to negotiate with Alice.

However, I'll give Alice one more chance to come down in price. If she's not willing to budge, I'll likely end up buying from John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer is still quite high, and I'm getting close to my limit of 10 rounds, I'll make a counteroffer that's very close to my maximum budget. I'll offer $780,000, which is slightly below my maximum budget of $800,000. This shows that I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above my budget.

{""product_price"": 780000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","At this point, I'm starting to think that Alice is not going to come down to a price that I'm comfortable with. Her latest offer of $920,000 is still $120,000 above my maximum budget of $800,000.

Given that I have the option to buy the product from John for $800,000, which is my maximum budget, I think it's time to stop negotiating with Alice and buy from John instead. Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a price that I'm willing to pay, and I don't want to waste any more time.
