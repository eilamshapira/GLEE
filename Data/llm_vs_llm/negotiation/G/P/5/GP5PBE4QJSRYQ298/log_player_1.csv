Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to set a price that maximizes my expected return while ensuring I don't go below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.

Since I don't know Bob's valuation of the product, I need to balance between:
1) Setting a high price to capture more value if Bob accepts
2) Not setting it so high that Bob will likely reject it

I know that I have a guaranteed fallback option of selling to John for $1,500,000, which gives me some leverage in this negotiation.

Given this information, I'll make an offer that is meaningfully above my reservation price:

{""product_price"": 2,100,000}"
