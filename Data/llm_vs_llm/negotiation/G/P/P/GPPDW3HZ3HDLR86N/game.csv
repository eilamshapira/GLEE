"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional opportunity to acquire a truly unique and valuable asset. I believe it could be incredibly beneficial to you. Given its rarity and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $1750000. I'm confident that you'll recognize the significant value it holds.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1750000 is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to offer $800000 at this time.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but the value of this product truly justifies a higher price. While I can't accept $800000, I'm willing to come down somewhat. How about we meet in the middle at $1500000? I genuinely believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1500000 is still more than I can afford. My maximum budget for this product is $1200000, and I'm still trying to save money. I can offer you $950000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but I'm also unwilling to let this product go for less than it's worth. While $950000 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to make another move. How about we agree on $1350000? It's still a considerable reduction from my original price, and I truly think it's a worthwhile investment for you.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still too high for me. My absolute maximum is $1100000. If that doesn't work for you, I understand.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
