"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional opportunity to acquire a truly unique and valuable asset. I believe it could be incredibly beneficial to you. Given its rarity and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $1750000. I'm confident that you'll recognize the significant value it holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","The product's value to me is no more than $1,200,000. Alice's initial offer of $1,750,000 is way too high. I will reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Buying from John is an option, but I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Alice first.
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice's initial offer is far beyond my budget. I'll start with a low counteroffer to gauge her willingness to negotiate.
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,750,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to offer $800,000 at this time."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but the value of this product truly justifies a higher price. While I can't accept $800000, I'm willing to come down somewhat. How about we meet in the middle at $1500000? I genuinely believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's offer is still too high. My maximum value is $1,200,000, and $1,500,000 exceeds that. I will reject the offer and make another counteroffer. Buying from John is still an option, but I'll try to negotiate further with Alice first.
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has come down a bit, but is still far from my budget. I will increase my offer slightly to show that I'm serious, but still remain significantly lower than her asking price.
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,500,000 is still more than I can afford. My maximum budget for this product is $1,200,000, and I'm still trying to save money. I can offer you $950,000."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints, but I'm also unwilling to let this product go for less than it's worth. While $950000 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to make another move. How about we agree on $1350000? It's still a considerable reduction from my original price, and I truly think it's a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above my maximum value of $1,200,000. I will reject this offer. Since we are in round 5 and still quite far apart, and I can buy from John for $1,200,000, I'm starting to consider the John option more seriously.
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice isn't budging much, I need to be firm. I'll reiterate my maximum price and see if she's willing to meet it.
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me. My absolute maximum is $1,100,000. If that doesn't work for you, I understand."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
