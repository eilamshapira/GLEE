"Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire a truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2000000. I believe this reflects its worth and the significant benefits it offers.  I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm confident you'll recognize its value.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $500000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $500000 is far below the product's actual value and my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1800000. This is a substantial reduction, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1800000 is still outside my comfort zone. Given the potential for negotiations, I'm willing to offer $1200000. I'm eager to finalize this deal, but it needs to be within my budget.  What are your thoughts on this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
