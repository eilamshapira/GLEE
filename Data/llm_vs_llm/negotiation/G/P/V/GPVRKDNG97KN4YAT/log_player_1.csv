Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. Since I know the product is worth at least $8,000 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, I should offer Bob a higher price. This way, if Bob accepts, I make more profit, and if he rejects, I still get my minimum acceptable price from John.

I'll set a significantly higher price, as I can always fall back on John's offer.
