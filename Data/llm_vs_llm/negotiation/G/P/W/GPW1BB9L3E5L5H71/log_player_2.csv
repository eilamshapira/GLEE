"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the unique value and potential of this product, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a premium opportunity for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I see that Alice is offering the product for $900,000, which is actually $100,000 more than the product is worth to me (my maximum value is $800,000). Alice's offer would give me negative value.

Since John is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $800,000, which matches my maximum value, it makes more sense to buy from John rather than accept Alice's above-maximum offer or engage in further negotiation that might not lead to a better price.
