Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $8,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $8,000
3. Since I have nothing to lose, I can try to get more from Bob
4. If Bob rejects, I still get $8,000 from John
5. Therefore, I should offer a price higher than $8,000 to maximize my potential profit
