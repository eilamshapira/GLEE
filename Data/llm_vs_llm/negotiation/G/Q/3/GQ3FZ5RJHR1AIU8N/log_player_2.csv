You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

 Alice's offer is higher than our maximum budget and what John is offering. We should make a counteroffer significantly lower to start negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

We're starting with a strong counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and our maximum budget. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice is negotiating, but we're still too high. We're getting closer to John's price, but there's still room to push for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

We're splitting the difference between our last offer and her current offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate but also maintains our position of seeking a significant discount."
