"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must say that $7000 is a bit lower than I was expecting. Considering the product's exceptional quality and potential benefits, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $10500. I believe this price is more reasonable, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",10500.0,Alice,3,
