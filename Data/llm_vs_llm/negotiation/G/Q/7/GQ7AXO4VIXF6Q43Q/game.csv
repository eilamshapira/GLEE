"Hi Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you. It's a high-quality item that I'm selling for $150. I believe this is a fair price given its value and quality. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $100 is the absolute minimum I could accept as that's what I can sell it for elsewhere. However, given the quality and value of this product, I could come down to $130, which I think is a fair compromise. Would that work for you?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $130 is still a bit high for me. Could you go down to $110? I think that would be a good deal for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
