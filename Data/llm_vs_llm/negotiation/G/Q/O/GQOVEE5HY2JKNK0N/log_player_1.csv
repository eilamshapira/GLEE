Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my strategy carefully here. The product is worth $1,200,000 to me, and I can always sell it to John for that amount. Bob values it at $1,000,000, so any price above that would be rejected. 

Given that I have a guaranteed buyer at my minimum acceptable price, I should start with an offer that gives me some room to negotiate while still being potentially acceptable to Bob.

{""product_price"": $1,000,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly below the guaranteed $1,200,000 I can get from John, and it's also well below the product's value to me. There's no reason for me to accept this offer when I have a much better alternative. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $950,000}"
