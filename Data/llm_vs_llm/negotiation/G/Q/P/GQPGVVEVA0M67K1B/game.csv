"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. Given its quality and utility, I'm offering it to you for $130. This price is fair considering the product's value in the market.",130.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice, but I believe the price is a bit high for me. I'm looking to spend no more than $110 for the product instead?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $110 is too low considering the value this product offers. I understand you're looking for a good deal, so I can come down to $125, which is still a fair price given this product is worth significantly more in the market. This represents a $5 discount from my initial offer.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. I understand where you're coming from, but I think $125 is still a bit high. What if I offer $115 instead? I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
