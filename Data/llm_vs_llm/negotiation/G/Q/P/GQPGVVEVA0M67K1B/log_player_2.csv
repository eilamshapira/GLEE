Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $110 is too low considering the value this product offers. I understand you're looking for a good deal, so I can come down to $125, which is still a fair price given this product is worth significantly more in the market. This represents a $5 discount from my initial offer.

# Your message to Alice:
Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. I understand where you're coming from, but I think $125 is still a bit high. What if I offer $115 instead? I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us."
