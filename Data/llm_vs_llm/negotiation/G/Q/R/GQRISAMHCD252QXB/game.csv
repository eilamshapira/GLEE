"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit higher than I was expecting. How about I offer you $60 instead?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us.  While $60 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $200. This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $200 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $70?",70.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. It seems we're still a ways off. To be honest, $70 is less than I'd like to sell it for. I'm willing to drop my price to $180, but that's my final offer.",180.0,Alice,5,
