"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product at $20000. This is a special offer reflecting its high quality and unique features. If you're interested in securing it at this price, please let me know. Otherwise, I'll be proceeding with another buyer at $10000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $20,000
3. John is willing to sell it for $8,000
4. Alice mentions having another buyer at $10,000, but this doesn't affect my decision since I have John's guaranteed offer

Since:
- Alice's price ($20,000) is significantly higher than my maximum value ($8,000)
- John's offer ($8,000) matches my maximum value
- I can definitely get the product from John at a reasonable price

The logical choice is to buy from John.
