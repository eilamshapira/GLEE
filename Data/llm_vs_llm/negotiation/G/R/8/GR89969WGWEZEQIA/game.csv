"Bob, I'm excited to begin this negotiation with you. Given the immense value this product will bring to your operations, I'm confident we can reach an agreement. To start, I'm offering you the product for $1150000.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in doing business with me. While your initial price of $1150000 is below what John is offering, I'm looking for a more competitive deal. Given that this product has a market value around $1000000, I'd like to counter with an offer of $950000. This gives you a substantial profit while allowing me to justify not going with other vendors. I look forward to reaching an agreement that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price. However, given the unique benefits this product provides, I believe it's worth more than the general market value you mentioned. Let's meet in the middle a bit. I'll come down to $1100000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I understand the product has value, but I need to ensure I'm making a financially sound decision. While your offer of $1100000 is moving in the right direction, I'm looking for a price closer to $1000000. Let me meet you part way at $1025000. This represents a fair price point that's significantly above your costs while giving me enough savings compared to John's option to justify the time we're spending on this negotiation. Does this work for you?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! $1025000 is tempting, but I still believe the value justifies a bit more. How about we settle at $1075000? This is my best offer for now, and I think it's a fair compromise that recognizes the product's true potential.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. We're definitely getting closer to an agreement. Your offer of $1075000 shows good faith, and I recognize you've come down significantly from your initial position. I can meet you at $1050000, which I believe represents a fair compromise. This gives you a very healthy profit margin while allowing me to realize meaningful savings compared to John's price. I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price and begin what I expect will be a mutually beneficial business relationship.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
