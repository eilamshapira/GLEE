"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to begin this negotiation with you. Given the immense value this product will bring to your operations, I'm confident we can reach an agreement. To start, I'm offering you the product for $1150000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice is offering the product for $1,150,000.
The product is worth up to $1,200,000 to me.
I could buy from John for $1,200,000 anytime.
Alice's cost is $800,000, so there's significant room for negotiation.

This first offer of $1,150,000 is $50,000 less than John's price, but I believe we can negotiate for a better deal since Alice has a $350,000 margin. I should make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in doing business with me. While your initial price of $1,150,000 is below what John is offering, I'm looking for a more competitive deal. Given that this product has a market value around $1,000,000, I'd like to counter with an offer of $950,000. This gives you a substantial profit while allowing me to justify not going with other vendors. I look forward to reaching an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price. However, given the unique benefits this product provides, I believe it's worth more than the general market value you mentioned. Let's meet in the middle a bit. I'll come down to $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her price from $1,150,000 to $1,100,000, which is a $50,000 reduction. This is progress, but there's still substantial room for negotiation since her cost is $800,000. The current offer is $100,000 less than John's price of $1,200,000, which is better but not optimal.

I should continue negotiating to try to reach a more favorable price. Alice has shown willingness to move, so I'll make another counteroffer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I understand the product has value, but I need to ensure I'm making a financially sound decision. While your offer of $1,100,000 is moving in the right direction, I'm looking for a price closer to $1,000,000. Let me meet you part way at $1,025,000. This represents a fair price point that's significantly above your costs while giving me enough savings compared to John's option to justify the time we're spending on this negotiation. Does this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer! $1025000 is tempting, but I still believe the value justifies a bit more. How about we settle at $1075000? This is my best offer for now, and I think it's a fair compromise that recognizes the product's true potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her price again, from $1,100,000 to $1,075,000. We're making steady progress in this negotiation. Let me evaluate this offer:

- Alice's new price of $1,075,000 is $125,000 less than John's alternative ($1,200,000)
- We've moved from Alice's initial offer of $1,150,000 down by $75,000
- Alice's cost is $800,000, so she still has a $275,000 profit margin
- We're in round 5 of 10 possible rounds

While this offer is increasingly attractive, I still see room for further negotiation. Since we've made consistent progress and have rounds remaining, I'll make one more counter to try to get a better price.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. We're definitely getting closer to an agreement. Your offer of $1,075,000 shows good faith, and I recognize you've come down significantly from your initial position. I can meet you at $1,050,000, which I believe represents a fair compromise. This gives you a very healthy profit margin while allowing me to realize meaningful savings compared to John's price. I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price and begin what I expect will be a mutually beneficial business relationship."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
