"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, given my budget and other market options available to me, I can only justify purchasing at a lower price. I'm prepared to offer $9000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is below my minimum threshold of $10,000, and I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, I will choose to sell the product to John.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
