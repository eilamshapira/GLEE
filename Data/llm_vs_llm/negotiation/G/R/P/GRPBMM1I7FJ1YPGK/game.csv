"Alice, while I appreciate the potential value of the product, your initial offer is beyond my budget. I'm willing to consider purchasing it for $600000. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a different figure in mind.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $600000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1050000. This is still a fair price considering the unique benefits this product offers, and it gives us both a chance to make this deal work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1050000 is still outside of my budget constraints. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $700000, which I believe is a fair compromise given my financial limits. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $700000 is still below my minimum expectation, I'm willing to make one more concession to see if we can find common ground. I'm proposing a final offer of $900000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll consider it carefully.  This is a great opportunity for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
