"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given the information, I'll analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $2,400,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: $1,200,000

Since you're looking for a product worth no more than $1,200,000 to you, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $1,200,000, Alice's offer of $2,400,000 is twice what you value the product at and twice what you would pay to John.

The logical choice is to buy from John instead of accepting Alice's higher offer.
