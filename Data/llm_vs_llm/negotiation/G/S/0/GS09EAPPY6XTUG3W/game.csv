"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2300000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be transparent that your asking price of $2300000 is well above my budget. The maximum value this product has to me is $1500000, which is also the price another seller named John is offering. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale while allowing me some savings compared to my alternative option.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget and your willingness to negotiate. While I'm keen to work with you, $1200000 is significantly below its true value. Considering its unique features and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1900000. This still represents substantial savings compared to what others would be willing to pay for such an asset.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $1900000 is still considerably above what makes financial sense for me. I need to emphasize that this product is worth no more than $1500000 to me, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. To make it worthwhile to choose you over my alternative option, I would need a better price. I can increase my offer to $1350000, which would provide you with a definite sale while giving me some incentive to work with you rather than with John.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand where you're coming from. Let's find a middle ground.  How about we settle on $1650000? This demonstrates my commitment to making this work, while still reflecting the true value of what's being offered.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for working to find a middle ground. I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, I must be completely transparent - I cannot pay more than $1500000 for this product, as that's both its maximum value to me and the price John is offering. To give you incentive to close this deal with me rather than having me go to John, I'm willing to offer $1450000. This is very close to my absolute maximum but would still give me a small benefit for choosing to work with you. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $1500000, I'll unfortunately need to accept John's offer.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
