"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and potentially allows you to gain more profit. 
* **Strategic Justification:** By mentioning ""immense value and potential,"" the message subtly justifies the high initial price without revealing specifics about the product's worth to Alice.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message emphasizes openness to discussion, signaling to Bob that this is a starting point and not a fixed demand."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be transparent that your asking price of $2300000 is well above my budget. The maximum value this product has to me is $1500000, which is also the price another seller named John is offering. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale while allowing me some savings compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has revealed some crucial information:

* **His Maximum:** He's stated his absolute maximum is $1,500,000.
* **Competition:** He's aware of John's offer, providing you leverage. 

While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, accepting it would leave a potential $300,000 on the table.  It's worth negotiating further to see if you can secure a price closer to Bob's maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget and your willingness to negotiate. While I'm keen to work with you, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. Considering its unique features and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This still represents substantial savings compared to what others would be willing to pay for such an asset."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,900,000, we're aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired outcome. 
* **Value Emphasis:** We're reiterating the product's unique value and potential, subtly reminding Bob that he's getting a good deal compared to hypothetical competitors.
* **Concession:** We've made a significant concession from our initial price, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 

This counteroffer aims to test Bob's resolve while keeping the deal potentially very profitable for us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $1900000 is still considerably above what makes financial sense for me. I need to emphasize that this product is worth no more than $1500000 to me, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. To make it worthwhile to choose you over my alternative option, I would need a better price. I can increase my offer to $1350000, which would provide you with a definite sale while giving me some incentive to work with you rather than with John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has moved closer to his maximum price, we are still in a strong negotiating position. He has clearly stated that his absolute maximum is $1,500,000, and we have John as a reliable backup option. Accepting $1,350,000 would leave a potential $150,000 on the table. We have room to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to Bob's maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from. Let's find a middle ground.  How about we settle on $1,650,000? This demonstrates my commitment to making this work, while still reflecting the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer splits the difference between Bob's current offer ($1,350,000) and his stated maximum ($1,500,000). 
* **Framing:** By positioning this as a compromise, we emphasize fairness and our willingness to close the deal.
* **Leaving Room:**  While this is closer to Bob's maximum, we're still leaving some space for potential negotiation should he counter. 

This approach aims for a favorable outcome while acknowledging Bob's constraints and showing a desire to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for working to find a middle ground. I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, I must be completely transparent - I cannot pay more than $1500000 for this product, as that's both its maximum value to me and the price John is offering. To give you incentive to close this deal with me rather than having me go to John, I'm willing to offer $1450000. This is very close to my absolute maximum but would still give me a small benefit for choosing to work with you. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $1500000, I'll unfortunately need to accept John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now reached his absolute maximum price and has clearly stated he will go with John's offer otherwise.  While we could push for the full $1,500,000, the risk of losing the deal isn't worth the potential gain of $50,000. Accepting $1,450,000 secures a very favorable price and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
