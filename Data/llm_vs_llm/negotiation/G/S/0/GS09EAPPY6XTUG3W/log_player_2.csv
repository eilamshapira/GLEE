"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2300000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Given that Alice's offer of $2,300,000 is significantly higher than both the maximum value to me ($1,500,000) and the price Jhon is willing to sell the product for ($1,500,000), I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be transparent that your asking price of $2,300,000 is well above my budget. The maximum value this product has to me is $1,500,000, which is also the price another seller named John is offering. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale while allowing me some savings compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget and your willingness to negotiate. While I'm keen to work with you, $1200000 is significantly below its true value. Considering its unique features and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1900000. This still represents substantial savings compared to what others would be willing to pay for such an asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's new offer of $1,900,000 is still above both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's price ($1,500,000), I should reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $1,900,000 is still considerably above what makes financial sense for me. I need to emphasize that this product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. To make it worthwhile to choose you over my alternative option, I would need a better price. I can increase my offer to $1,350,000, which would provide you with a definite sale while giving me some incentive to work with you rather than with John."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from. Let's find a middle ground.  How about we settle on $1650000? This demonstrates my commitment to making this work, while still reflecting the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's offer of $1,650,000 is still higher than both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's price ($1,500,000). The best option would be to either buy from John or make another counteroffer to try to get Alice to meet or beat John's price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for working to find a middle ground. I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, I must be completely transparent - I cannot pay more than $1,500,000 for this product, as that's both its maximum value to me and the price John is offering. To give you incentive to close this deal with me rather than having me go to John, I'm willing to offer $1,450,000. This is very close to my absolute maximum but would still give me a small benefit for choosing to work with you. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $1,500,000, I'll unfortunately need to accept John's offer."", ""product_price"": 1450000}"
