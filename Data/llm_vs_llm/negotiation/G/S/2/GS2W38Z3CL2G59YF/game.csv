"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $170 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $100. Let me know if that's something you'd be open to.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $100 is a bit too low for me. I'd be willing to sell it to you for $160. Let me know if that's something you'd be open to.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, I'm still a bit short of being comfortable with $160. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle between my previous offer and your current offer. I'd like to propose $120. Let me know if that's something you'd be open to.",120.0,Bob,4,
