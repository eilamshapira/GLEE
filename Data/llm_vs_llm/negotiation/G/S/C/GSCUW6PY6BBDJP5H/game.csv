"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $145. This is a fair price considering the product's worth.",145.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $145 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $110 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. Given the product's quality and value, I can offer it to you for $135. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents good value for the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $135 is still a bit high for me. Could you go down to $120? I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you moving up in your offer, but since I know this product has significant value, I can come down to $130. This is a fair price that gives you $20 in savings from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $130 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $125? That's a fair compromise, I believe.",125.0,Bob,6,
