"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $145. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 145}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $145 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and it's even below John's guaranteed offer. Bob has room to increase his price since the product is worth $150 to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $110 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. Given the product's quality and value, I can offer it to you for $135. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents good value for the product."", ""product_price"": 135}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $135 is still a bit high for me. Could you go down to $120? I think that would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer. Since Bob moved up from $110 to $120, and I know the product is worth $150 to him, there's still room for negotiation to reach a better price. Both Bob's current offer and John's guaranteed offer are at $120, so there's no risk in continuing negotiation for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you moving up in your offer, but since I know this product has significant value, I can come down to $130. This is a fair price that gives you $20 in savings from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $130 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $125? That's a fair compromise, I believe. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $125. This is a reasonable compromise as it's $5 better than John's guaranteed offer of $120, and we've been going back and forth for several rounds. While the product is worth $150 to Bob, he's been gradually increasing his offers, and there's a risk he might walk away if we continue pushing for more, which would leave me with only John's $120 offer."
