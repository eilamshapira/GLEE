"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The rational choice is to buy from John for $1,000,000 because:
1. Alice's offer ($1,500,000) is higher than my maximum valuation ($1,000,000)
2. Alice's offer is also higher than John's fixed price ($1,000,000)
3. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, she is unlikely to accept any offer below that amount
4. John's price matches my maximum valuation and is the best guaranteed option"
