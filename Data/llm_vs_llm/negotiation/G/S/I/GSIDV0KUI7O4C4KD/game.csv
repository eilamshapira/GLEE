"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I understand would be quite valuable for your business. Given its market value and the benefits it will bring to your operations, I'm offering it at $1300000. This represents a fair price considering the $1500000 value you'll receive, giving you an immediate $200000 in value upon purchase. I look forward to your response.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value proposition, $1300000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay at this point. I'm willing to offer $1100000 for the product. This reflects a significant saving for you while still providing you with a healthy profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1100000 is moving in the right direction, I need to consider that this product has significant value both to you and in the market. I can come down to $1225000, which still provides you with $275000 in immediate value upon purchase. This represents a fair middle ground between our positions, and I believe it's a win-win price point for both of us. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1225000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1150000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both parties.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your increased offer. We're making progress in our negotiation. After careful consideration, I can come down to $1200000. This price point represents a substantial value for you - a $300000 gain on your investment immediately. It's also closer to your offer while still reflecting the true value of this product. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both. I'm looking forward to closing this deal with you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1200000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still hoping to find a price that's closer to my budget.  To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to offer $1175000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
