"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value; however, your asking price is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $6000 to make this deal happen.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that my initial price may have been a bit steep, but I'm willing to negotiate. However, $6000 is still below my comfort zone. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's discuss a price that reflects the product's true value.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $7000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial price. However, $7000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $10000? I think this price reflects the product's value and is a reasonable compromise.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for moving closer to my range. While $10000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. To make this work, I could go up to $7500. That's a significant jump from my last offer and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your latest offer and the effort you're putting into making this deal happen. However, $7500 is still a bit short of my expectations. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'll meet you in the middle between my last offer and your latest proposal. Let's consider $8750 as a potential price point. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",8750.0,Alice,7,
