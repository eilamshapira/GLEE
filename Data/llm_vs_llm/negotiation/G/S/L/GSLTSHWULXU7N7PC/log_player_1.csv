"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value; however, your asking price is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $6000 to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target price. $6,000 is too low for me, and I believe the product is worth more. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob before considering selling to John for $12,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that my initial price may have been a bit steep, but I'm willing to negotiate. However, $6,000 is still below my comfort zone. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's discuss a price that reflects the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $7000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

$7,000 is still below my target price, and I believe I can get a better offer from Bob. I'll make another counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us. Selling to John for $12,000 is still an option, but I'd like to explore the possibility of a deal with Bob a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial price. However, $7,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $10,000? I think this price reflects the product's value and is a reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for moving closer to my range. While $10000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. To make this work, I could go up to $7500. That's a significant jump from my last offer and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

$7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to sell the product for that amount. I've come down significantly from my initial offer, and I expect Bob to meet me closer to my target price. Since we're halfway through the negotiation rounds, I'll make another counteroffer, but I'll also start considering selling to John for $12,000 more seriously if Bob doesn't budge."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your latest offer and the effort you're putting into making this deal happen. However, $7,500 is still a bit short of my expectations. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'll meet you in the middle between my last offer and your latest proposal. Let's consider $8,750 as a potential price point. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 8750}"
