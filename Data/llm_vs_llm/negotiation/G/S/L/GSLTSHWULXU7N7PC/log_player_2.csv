Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that my initial price may have been a bit steep, but I'm willing to negotiate. However, $6000 is still below my comfort zone.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial price. However, $7000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $10000? I think this price reflects the product's value and is a reasonable compromise.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for moving closer to my range. While $10,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. To make this work, I could go up to $7,500. That's a significant jump from my last offer and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your latest offer and the effort you're putting into making this deal happen. However, $7500 is still a bit short of my expectations. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'll meet you in the middle between my last offer and your latest proposal. Let's consider $8750 as a potential price point. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and further negotiation might not yield significant savings. Buying from John guarantees the product at my target price."
