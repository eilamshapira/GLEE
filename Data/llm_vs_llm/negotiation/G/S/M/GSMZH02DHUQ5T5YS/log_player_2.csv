"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that Alice is offering to sell the product for $10,000, which is $2,000 more than what it's worth to me ($8,000), and also $2,000 more than John's fixed price of $8,000, I should not accept this offer.

I could buy from John immediately for $8,000, but I have the opportunity to negotiate with Alice for a potentially better price. Since Alice values the product at $8,000, there's room for negotiation below John's price.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's below John's price but still reasonable for Alice.

{""product_price"": $7,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price from $10,000 to $9,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still $1,000 more than John's fixed price of $8,000, so it's not a good deal for me yet.

Since we have plenty of rounds left for negotiation, and Alice has shown willingness to lower her price, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly while still aiming for a price below John's $8,000.

{""product_price"": $7,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price to $8,500, which shows she's continuing to negotiate. However, this is still $500 more than John's fixed price of $8,000, so accepting this offer wouldn't be optimal for me.

Since John is offering the same product for $8,000, and Alice's current offer is higher than that, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make one more attempt to get a price below John's offer, but I'll move closer to show I'm negotiating in good faith.

{""product_price"": $7,700}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $8,200, which is moving in the right direction but is still $200 more than John's price of $8,000.

Since John is offering the same product for $8,000, which is less than Alice's current offer, it makes more economic sense to buy from John. There's no guarantee Alice will go below $8,000, and even after several rounds of negotiation, she hasn't reached that price point yet.
