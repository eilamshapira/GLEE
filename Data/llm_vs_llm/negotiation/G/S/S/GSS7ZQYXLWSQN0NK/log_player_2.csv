"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer is exactly at my maximum budget of $1,200,000 and buying from John would cost the same, there's no financial advantage to rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John. However, I might consider rejecting the offer to see if Alice would be willing to negotiate a lower price. But given the information, accepting the offer seems like the most straightforward choice since it meets my budget exactly and I don't have any indication that Alice would lower the price.
