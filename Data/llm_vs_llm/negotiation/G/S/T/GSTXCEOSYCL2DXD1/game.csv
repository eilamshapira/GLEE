"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $180 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to consider this price?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I apologize, but I cannot accept $60 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to be flexible. Given the quality and value of the product, I can offer it to you for $150. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. However, $150 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
