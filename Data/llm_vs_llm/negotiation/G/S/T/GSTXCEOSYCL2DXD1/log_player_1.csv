"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product to offer you today. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $180 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will reject Bob's offer of $60 as it is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. I apologize, but I cannot accept $60 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to be flexible. Given the quality and value of the product, I can offer it to you for $150. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. However, $150 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I will accept Bob's offer of $105. This is a reasonable price that exceeds my minimum acceptable price of $100, and it's better than my guaranteed option of selling to John for $100. While I might have been able to negotiate for a bit more, there's always the risk of losing the deal entirely, and $105 represents a fair compromise."
