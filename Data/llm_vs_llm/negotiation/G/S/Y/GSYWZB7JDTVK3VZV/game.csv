"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider selling it for $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $85 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we settle at $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"Thanks, Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, I'm really trying to stick to my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $88?",88.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I see where you're coming from with your budget. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $90? It's just a little bit more than your offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.",90.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're close to finding a deal. Let's meet halfway. How about $89? This way, we both make a small compromise, but I believe it's a fair price for the value you're getting.",89.0,Alice,5,
