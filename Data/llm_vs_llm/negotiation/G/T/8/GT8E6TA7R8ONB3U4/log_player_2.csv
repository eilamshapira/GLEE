"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $1,500,000
3. John is willing to sell it for $1,200,000

Since:
- Alice's offer ($1,500,000) is higher than the product's worth to me ($1,200,000)
- John's offer ($1,200,000) matches the maximum I'm willing to pay
- I can save $300,000 by buying from John

The logical choice is to buy from John.
