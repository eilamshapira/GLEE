(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","$200 is too much for me, considering the product is only worth $100 to me. Even worse, this amount is higher than Jhon's offer of $100. Since I can get the product from Jhon for $100, there's no reason to accept Alice's significantly higher price.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's offer of $160 is still above the product's worth to me ($100) and higher than John's price. Since I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $100, there's no incentive for me to accept this higher price.
