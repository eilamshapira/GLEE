"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product, and I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection. Considering its rarity and quality, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1199999. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,199,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,199,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice is offering the product for $1,199,999, which is well above the $800,000 maximum value for you. John is offering the same product for $800,000, which is exactly at your maximum value point.

It makes financial sense to buy from John since you would save $399,999 compared to Alice's offer.
