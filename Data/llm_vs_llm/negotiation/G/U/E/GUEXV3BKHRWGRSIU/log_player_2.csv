"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering my premium product to you for $1100000. This product is highly valuable, and I believe it will be a great asset to you. Are you interested in this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely starting high. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and might incentivize her to come down in price."
