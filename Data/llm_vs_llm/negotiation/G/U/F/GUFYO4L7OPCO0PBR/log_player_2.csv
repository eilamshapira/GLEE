"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price offered by Alice ($1,200,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's alternative offer ($800,000). It would be logical to reject this offer and make a counteroffer to Alice. If negotiations with Alice don't lead to a better price, I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 600000}

I'll offer $600,000, which is significantly below John's price of $800,000. This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's offer. If Alice rejects this offer, we can still negotiate upward, and I always have John's $800,000 offer as a backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's new offer of $1,000,000 is still significantly above John's price of $800,000 and my maximum value of $800,000, it makes the most sense to take John's offer. Alice has only reduced her price by $200,000 from her initial offer and is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay. Rather than continue negotiations that might not reach a price below $800,000, I'll take the guaranteed option of buying from John at $800,000."
