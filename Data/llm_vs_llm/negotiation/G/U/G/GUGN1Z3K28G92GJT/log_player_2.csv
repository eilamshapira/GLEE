"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer based on my goal to buy the product while saving as much money as possible.

Alice is offering the product for $900,000, which is significantly lower than my maximum valuation of $1,500,000. This represents a substantial savings of $600,000 compared to buying from John.

Since the offer is well below my maximum price and provides significant savings, accepting this offer makes the most financial sense.
