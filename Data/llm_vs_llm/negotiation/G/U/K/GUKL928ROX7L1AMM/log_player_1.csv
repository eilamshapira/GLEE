Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a price to offer to Bob that maximizes my expected profit.

Since I know the product is worth at least $120 to me (and I can definitely sell it to John for $120 if Bob rejects), I'll need to set a price higher than $120.

If I set the price too high, Bob might reject the offer, and I'll end up with $120 from John. If I set it too low (but still above $120), I might be leaving money on the table.

Without knowing Bob's exact valuation, I'll choose a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still potentially reasonable for a buyer:

{""product_price"": 180}"
