"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $60. Let me know what you think!",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $60 is significantly below what I can accept. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $115?  This gives you a good price, and still allows me to get a fair value for it.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I can go up to $70. Let's see if we can meet in the middle somewhere. What do you say?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $70 is still too low.  Let's try $95.  That's a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $95 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to keep it under $80. How about we settle at $75? That way, we're both making a compromise.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $75 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's meet halfway and get this deal done.",85.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $85. I'm really trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $80? That's the highest I can go, and it's a round number that might work for both of us.",80.0,Bob,8,
