"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,200,000
2. Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000, which is above my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $1,200,000, which matches my maximum value
4. If I accept Alice's offer, I would be paying $300,000 more than my maximum value
5. The rational choice is to buy from John at $1,200,000
