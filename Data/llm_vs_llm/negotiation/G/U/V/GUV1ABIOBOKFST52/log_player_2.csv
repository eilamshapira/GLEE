"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer of $12,000 is above the $10,000 value of the product to me, and also above the $10,000 price that John is offering, I should not accept this offer. I can either immediately buy from John or try to negotiate with Alice for a better price.

Given that I can buy from John at any point, I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above the $10,000 price that John is offering. Since I can buy the product from John for $10,000 at any time, there's no reason to accept a higher price from Alice.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.
