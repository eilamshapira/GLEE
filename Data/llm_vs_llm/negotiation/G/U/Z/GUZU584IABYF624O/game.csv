"Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering my budget, I'd be willing to purchase the product for $500000. Let me know if that works for you.",500000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $500000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $2000000. What are your thoughts on this?",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're quite far apart on the price. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my offer to $1800000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us. What do you say?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle. However, my budget constraints remain a priority. How about we agree on $750000 for the product?",750000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your budget constraints, $750000 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down further to $1650000, which is very close to my bottom line. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a workable solution. Given your budget constraints and my need to maintain a certain value, I'm proposing a final offer of $1600000. This is the lowest I can go while still feeling that the deal is fair. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
