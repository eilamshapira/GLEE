Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a high initial offer to leave room for potential negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer ($720,000) is below my minimum acceptable value ($800,000) and even below John's guaranteed offer ($800,000), I will reject this offer. However, since I always have John's offer as a backup, I'll try one more round of negotiation with Bob to see if we can reach a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still keep it well above my minimum value to maintain room for negotiation while ensuring profitability.
