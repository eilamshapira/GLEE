"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's price ($1,200,000), and this price is at my maximum limit, I should try to negotiate with Alice for a better price. If I can't get a better deal, I can always fall back to either Alice's or John's offer later.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a significantly lower offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be unreasonable. I'll offer about 60% of the maximum price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a significantly better offer from Alice, as it's $250,000 less than both her initial offer and John's price. While I could try to negotiate further, this is already a substantial savings, and there's a risk that Alice might increase her price if I continue negotiating. Since my goal is to save money while securing the product, I should accept this favorable offer.
