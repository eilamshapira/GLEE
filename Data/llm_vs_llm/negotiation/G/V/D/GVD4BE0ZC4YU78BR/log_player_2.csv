"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its unique features and market value, I'm offering it at $2300000. This is a competitive price considering the product's quality and potential returns. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","The offer from Alice is $2,300,000, which is much higher than my maximum willingness to pay of $800,000.

Therefore, I should reject the offer and buy from John.
