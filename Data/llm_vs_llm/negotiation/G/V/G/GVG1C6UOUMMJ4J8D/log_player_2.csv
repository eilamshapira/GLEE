"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Looking at the situation:

Alice's offer is $1,200,000, which is exactly the same price that John is offering and exactly the maximum the product is worth to me. If I accept this offer, I would pay the full value and get no consumer surplus.

Since John's price is also $1,200,000, buying from him doesn't give me any advantage over Alice's current offer.

However, by rejecting Alice's offer, I can make a counteroffer that's lower than $1,200,000. If Alice accepts my counteroffer, I would save money. If Alice rejects and makes a new higher counteroffer, I can still fall back to either accepting her new offer or buying from John.

Since there's potential upside and no downside to making a counteroffer, I'll reject this offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, giving room for negotiation while still being potentially acceptable.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has now offered $900,000, which is $300,000 less than both her original offer and John's price. This is a significant improvement and represents a 25% discount from the maximum value to me.

Since Alice has already come down significantly from her initial offer, this shows she's willing to negotiate and might be motivated to sell. The $900,000 price gives me good consumer surplus.

I could reject and try to counter even lower, but Alice has already made a substantial concession, and there's a risk she might walk away or increase her price if I push too hard. Given that I can save $300,000 compared to buying from John, I'll accept this offer.
