Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I certainly can't sell the product for less then $1,200,000.

{""product_price"": 1600000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1600000}

I've reconsidered and I'm willing to lower the price to $1,600,000. This is a fair price given the value and quality of the product. I believe it's an offer that benefits both of us."
