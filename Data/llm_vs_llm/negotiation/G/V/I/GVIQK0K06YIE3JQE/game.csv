,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is too high for me. While I'm genuinely interested in the product, I believe a more reasonable price would be $850000. This would still provide you with a good profit margin while being more affordable for me. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900000. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. To show I'm serious about making this deal work, I'm willing to increase my offer to $870000. This represents a fair middle ground and would still give you a solid profit margin. What do you say?",870000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $870000 isn't quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference and go with $890000.  This gives us both a good deal and keeps the negotiation moving forward.",890000.0,Alice,5,

"Thanks for continuing to work with me on this, Alice. I see you've come down $10000, and I appreciate that. To keep us moving toward an agreement, I can increase my offer to $880000. This seems like a fair compromise that would work well for both of us. What are your thoughts?",880000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close. However,  $880000 still isn't quite right for me. I'm willing to go to $885000 as a final offer. This would give us both a fair outcome, and I'm hopeful we can close this deal.  What do you say?",885000.0,Alice,7,
