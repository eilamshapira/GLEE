"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $950,000
2. The product is worth $800,000 to Alice
3. I can buy it from John for $1,000,000
4. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me
5. We have 10 rounds to negotiate

Since Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is already lower than John's price ($1,000,000), but still significantly above Alice's value ($800,000), I should reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price. There's plenty of negotiation rounds left, and I can always fall back to John's offer if needed.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice values the product at $800,000 and offered $950,000, I should make a reasonable counteroffer that shows I'm serious but also leaves room for negotiation. I'll propose a price closer to the middle ground between her cost and her initial offer.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is too high for me. While I'm genuinely interested in the product, I believe a more reasonable price would be $850,000. This would still provide you with a good profit margin while being more affordable for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900000. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let's analyze the situation:

1. Alice has moved down from $950,000 to $900,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. The $50,000 reduction indicates she might be willing to go lower
3. The current price is still $100,000 above her value of $800,000
4. We still have 7 more rounds of negotiation possible
5. John's price of $1,000,000 remains as a backup

Alice has shown flexibility by reducing her price, but there's still room for negotiation. Since we have several rounds left and the current price is significantly above Alice's value, I should continue negotiating for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $50,000 from her initial offer, I'll also show some flexibility by increasing my previous offer. This shows good faith in the negotiation while still trying to get a better deal.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. To show I'm serious about making this deal work, I'm willing to increase my offer to $870,000. This represents a fair middle ground and would still give you a solid profit margin. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 870000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $870000 isn't quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference and go with $890000.  This gives us both a good deal and keeps the negotiation moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let's analyze the current situation:

1. The negotiation has progressed well:
   - Alice started at $950,000
   - Then $900,000
   - Now $890,000
2. Alice's movement suggests she's willing to negotiate but in smaller increments now
3. We're $90,000 below John's price
4. We still have 5 rounds left
5. The current price is still $90,000 above Alice's value ($800,000)

While Alice is showing continued flexibility, the decrements are getting smaller ($10,000 this time vs. $50,000 earlier). However, since we still have 5 rounds left and there's still a significant gap between the offer and Alice's value, it's worth trying one more counter.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down by $10,000, I'll also show continued flexibility by moving up a similar amount from my last offer, maintaining the momentum of the negotiation while still seeking a better price.

{""message"": ""Thanks for continuing to work with me on this, Alice. I see you've come down $10,000, and I appreciate that. To keep us moving toward an agreement, I can increase my offer to $880,000. This seems like a fair compromise that would work well for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 880000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're close. However,  $880000 still isn't quite right for me. I'm willing to go to $885000 as a final offer. This would give us both a fair outcome, and I'm hopeful we can close this deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let's analyze the current situation:

1. The negotiation progression:
   - $950,000 → $900,000 → $890,000 → $885,000
2. Alice's movements are getting very small ($5,000 now)
3. She's framing this as her ""final offer""
4. The price is $115,000 below John's price
5. While still $85,000 above her value, the rate of decrease suggests we might not get much lower
6. We have 3 rounds left, but Alice seems to be reaching her limit

Given that:
- Alice has labeled this her ""final offer""
- The decrements have become very small
- The price is significantly better than John's
- There's risk of Alice walking away if we push too hard
- The total movement from her initial offer has been substantial ($65,000)

It seems prudent to accept this offer now rather than risk losing the progress we've made.
