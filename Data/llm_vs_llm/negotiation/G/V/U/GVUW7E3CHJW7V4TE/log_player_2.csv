"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $110. This is a fair price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice. $110 is too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 
We'll start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $90 is too low considering the product's value, I can come down to $105. This is a good compromise given the quality and market value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate. Let's see if we can get a bit closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for considering my previous offer, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $97.50?"",
""product_price"": 97.50
}
```

We are proposing a compromise that meets Alice halfway. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to our target."
