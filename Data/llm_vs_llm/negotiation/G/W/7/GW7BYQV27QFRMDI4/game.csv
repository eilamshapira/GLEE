,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a price of $70, which I think is a fair deal for both of us.",70.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're interested in the product. However, $70 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I can see that we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet your budget. I'd like to offer the product to you for $85. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value.",85.0,Alice,7,
