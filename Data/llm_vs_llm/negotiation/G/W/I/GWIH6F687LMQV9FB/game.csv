"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $13000 is significantly above my budget. Given that I can get a similar product elsewhere for $8000, I would need a much more competitive price. I would be willing to offer $7000 for the product. This would still give you a reasonable profit while being more aligned with market prices.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must consider the product's value and the offers I have from other potential buyers. Given this, I am willing to make a concession and lower the price, but $7000 is still below my expectations. I can offer you the product for $11500, which is the lowest price I am comfortable with at this time.",11500.0,Alice,3,
