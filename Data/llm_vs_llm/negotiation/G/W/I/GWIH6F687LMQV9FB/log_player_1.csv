Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. After careful consideration, I've set a competitive price for it. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $13000 is significantly above my budget. Given that I can get a similar product elsewhere for $8000, I would need a much more competitive price. I would be willing to offer $7000 for the product. This would still give you a reasonable profit while being more aligned with market prices. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must consider the product's value and the offers I have from other potential buyers.

I can offer you the product for $11,500, which is the lowest price I am comfortable with at this time."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
