Given that I can get a similar product elsewhere for $8,000, I would need a much more competitive price. I would be willing to offer $7,000 for the product. This would still give you a reasonable profit while being more aligned with market prices."", ""product_price"": 7000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must consider the product's value and the offers I have from other potential buyers. Given this, I am willing to make a concession and lower the price, but $7000 is still below my expectations. I can offer you the product for $11500, which is the lowest price I am comfortable with at this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.
