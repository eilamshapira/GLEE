"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. This is a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $800,000
2. Alice's offer is $1,000,000, which is $200,000 more than my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $800,000, which matches my maximum value
4. While I could try negotiating with Alice by making a counteroffer, there's no guarantee she'll go below $800,000, especially since the product is worth $1,200,000 to her

Given that:
1. Alice's current offer is above my maximum value
2. John's offer is exactly at my maximum value
3. There's a risk of prolonged negotiation with Alice without guarantee of a better price

The most rational decision is to buy from John, as this guarantees I get the product at my maximum acceptable price without further negotiation risk.
