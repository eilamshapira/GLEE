"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I certainly understand that $17,000 might be a bit high for you, but $10,000 is below the value I see in the product. How about we meet halfway?

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15500}

Bob, I understand that $17,000 might be a bit high for you, but I believe the value of the product is well above $10,000. Let's meet halfway at $15,500. This way, we both can walk away from the deal feeling good about it. What do you think?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I see that we have different perspectives on the value of the product. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to buy the product for $15,000. Therefore, I will sell it to him.

I hope we can do business again in the future."
