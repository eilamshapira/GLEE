"Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","The offer of $17,000 is above the $12,000 the product is worth to me, and it's also above John's price of $12,000. It doesn't make sense to accept this offer when I can get the same product from John for $5,000 less.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since John is selling the product for $12,000 and the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, I should offer Alice a price that makes sense for both of us. Alice values the product at $15,000, so any price above that would be profitable for her.

I'll offer a price below John's price to try to get a better deal:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above the $12,000 that John is offering and above what the product is worth to me. Since I can get the same product from John for $12,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's higher price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I need to be more strategic with my counteroffer. Alice values the product at $15,000, so she won't accept anything below that amount. However, I have the option to buy from John at $12,000, which sets my maximum price. I'll make one more attempt at a better price than John's offer.
