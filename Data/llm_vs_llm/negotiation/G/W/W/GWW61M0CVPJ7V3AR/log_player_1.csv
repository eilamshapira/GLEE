"Round 1

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll reject Bob's offer since it's below even my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000) and also below John's guaranteed offer. Bob's low offer of $1,000,000 suggests he's trying to negotiate aggressively, but I still have plenty of rounds left to negotiate.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer, but still maintain a strong position since I have John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 as a backup.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob has increased his offer to $1,250,000, which is better than John's guaranteed $1,200,000. While there might still be room for negotiation, with only 4 rounds remaining and the risk of Bob walking away, I'll accept this offer as it provides a reasonable profit above my minimum acceptable value.
