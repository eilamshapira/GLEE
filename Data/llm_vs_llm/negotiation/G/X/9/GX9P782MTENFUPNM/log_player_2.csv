"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this situation.

Alice has offered the product for $100. This is well below my maximum value of $150, which means it's a good deal for me.

I have the option to buy from John at $150, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay. Since Alice's offer of $100 is $50 less than John's price, I would save $50 by accepting Alice's offer.

I could reject and make a counteroffer, but since Alice's initial offer is already quite reasonable (below my maximum value), there's limited benefit in potentially jeopardizing the deal for a small additional discount.
