"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm open to negotiations, but I'll start with a price of $120. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer of $120 is higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80), it doesn't make sense to accept it. While I could make a counteroffer, I already know that John is selling the same product for $80, which is equal to my maximum value. There's no guarantee that negotiating with Alice will result in a better price than John's offer.

Therefore, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
