Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think would be perfect for you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it to you for $145. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 145}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $145 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider selling it to me for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $130 is relatively low considering the product is worth $150 to him, and significantly lower than my initial offer, I'll reject and make a counteroffer. We still have room for negotiation between $130 and $145, and I can always fall back on John's $120 offer if needed."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $130 is lower than what I can accept. However, I can be a bit flexible on the price. Given the product's quality and value, I can offer it to you for $140. This is a $5 reduction from my initial offer, which I believe is quite reasonable."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the updated offer, Alice. I'm still aiming to save some money. How about $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $135. This is a reasonable compromise as it's well above my minimum acceptable price of $120 and represents a fair middle ground between our initial positions. While it's less than my desired price, it's better than selling to John for $120, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether."
