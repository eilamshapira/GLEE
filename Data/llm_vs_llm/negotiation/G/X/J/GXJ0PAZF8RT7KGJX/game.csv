"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $60 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is significantly below the product's value. While I want to work with you, I cannot go below $110 as I have other potential buyers willing to pay more. This is already a reduction from my initial offer.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I still think $110 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
