"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $120."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $60 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. The current offer of $60 is too low as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is significantly below the product's value. While I want to work with you, I cannot go below $110 as I have other potential buyers willing to pay more. This is already a reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I still think $110 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $100. Bob's maximum offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and since John is willing to pay $100, that's the better option for me."
