"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to analyze this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering the product for $11,000, which exceeds its worth to me ($8,000). This means I would be paying $3,000 more than the product's value to me, which doesn't make economic sense.

I also have the option to buy from John for $8,000, which exactly matches the maximum value of the product to me. While this would be a fair price, I should first try negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a better deal.

Since this is just round 1 of 10 possible rounds, I have plenty of opportunity to negotiate. I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but still gives me room to negotiate.

{""product_price"": $6,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price from $11,000 to $9,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, the current offer of $9,000 is still above what John is offering ($8,000) and above the maximum value the product has to me.

Given that John's price exactly matches my maximum valuation, and Alice's offer is still above that, I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer. We still have several rounds of negotiation available.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $7,200}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price again to $8,500, which is getting closer to John's price of $8,000. However, since John's price is still lower and matches my maximum valuation, the rational choice is to buy from John unless Alice can beat that price.
