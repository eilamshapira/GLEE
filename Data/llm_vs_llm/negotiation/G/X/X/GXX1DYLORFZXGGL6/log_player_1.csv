Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $95. It's a great value and I think you'll be very happy with it. Are you interested?"", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I think $95 is a bit steep for me. Based on my research, I'd be comfortable paying $85 for this product. This still gives you a profit while working within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, as I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can potentially sell the product for more than $85. I won't sell to John yet, as I want to try to get a better price from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but I think we can find a middle ground. How about we settle for $90? This way, we both give a little and get a fair deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
