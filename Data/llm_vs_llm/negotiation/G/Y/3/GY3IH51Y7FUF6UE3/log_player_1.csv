Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its value and significance, I'm offering it to you at a price of:"", ""product_price"": 1450000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. Considering the product's value, I'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Considering Bob's counteroffer, my options are:

*   **Accept:** Sell for $1,250,000 (Profit: $50,000)
*   **Reject and Counter:** Aim for a higher price.
*   **Sell to John:** Sell for $1,200,000 (Profit: $0)

I believe I can get a better price. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed with a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, I believe the value is higher. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about:"", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me closer to the middle. However, I still believe there's room for a better price. I'd like to propose another counteroffer, slightly higher than my previous one. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Okay, let's analyze the situation again. Bob is now offering $1,300,000.

*   **Accept:** Sell for $1,300,000 (Profit: $100,000)
*   **Reject and Counter:** Aim for a higher price. Risk of losing the deal.
*   **Sell to John:** Sell for $1,200,000 (Profit: $0)

My initial offer was $1,450,000 and his counteroffer was $1,250,000. My counteroffer was $1,400,000 and his new counteroffer is $1,300,000. The negotiation is taking longer than expected. The risk of losing the deal and selling to John for the minimum price is becoming higher. I think it is time to accept Bob's offer.
