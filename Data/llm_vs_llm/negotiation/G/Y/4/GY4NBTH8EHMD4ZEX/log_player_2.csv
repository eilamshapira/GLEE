"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $11,700, I need to decide if it's worth accepting or if I should negotiate further.

The product is worth up to $12,000 to me, and Alice's cost is $10,000. Her offer of $11,700 is below my maximum price, saving me $300 compared to buying from John at $12,000.

While I could try to negotiate a better price with Alice (since there's $1,700 of potential surplus between her cost and her current offer), I'll accept this offer since it already provides me with some savings and avoids the risk of a negotiation breakdown.
