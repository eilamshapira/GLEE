Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $15,000."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I think $15000 is too high for this product. I can get the same product from John for that price. I'd be willing to pay $10000, which would be a better deal for me while still giving you a fair profit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
