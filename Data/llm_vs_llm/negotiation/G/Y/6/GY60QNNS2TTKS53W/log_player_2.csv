"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer here. 

Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is exactly the maximum amount I'm willing to pay. This is also exactly the same price as John's offer.

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($15,000), and this price is at my maximum value threshold, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer immediately. I should try to negotiate a better price with Alice first.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I think $15,000 is too high for this product. I can get the same product from John for that price. I'd be willing to pay $10,000, which would be a better deal for me while still giving you a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
