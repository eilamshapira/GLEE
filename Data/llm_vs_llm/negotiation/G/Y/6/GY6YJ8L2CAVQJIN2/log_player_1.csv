Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price to offer Bob:

Bob values the product at $15,000, which is his maximum willingness to pay. If he rejects my offer, I can still sell to John for $12,000. To maximize my profit while ensuring a reasonable chance of acceptance, I should offer a price that leaves some surplus for Bob but is well above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.

I'll offer $14,000, which:
1. Gives me $2,000 more than my fallback option with John
2. Leaves $1,000 in surplus for Bob ($15,000 - $14,000)
3. Makes it rational for Bob to accept
