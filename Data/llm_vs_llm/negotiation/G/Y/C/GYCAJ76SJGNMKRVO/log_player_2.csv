"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a quality product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it for $300, which is a fair market price for this item. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's offer of $300 is far above the maximum value of $100 that the product is worth to me. Since John is willing to sell me the same product for $100, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay, there's no reason to accept Alice's current high offer or even negotiate further.
