"Alice,  $1500000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. To be fair to both of us, how about we settle at $1400000? This way, you get an incredible product, and I secure a deal closer to its worth. Let me know if we can make this happen.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1400000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
