You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","The offer from Alice is $150, which is much higher than the $80 that the product is worth to me. It also exceeds John's offer of $80.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since John is willing to sell the product for $80, and that's the maximum amount I'm willing to pay for this product, I'll make a more reasonable counteroffer to Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $130 is still higher than the $80 that John is offering and more than the product is worth to me. Since I have a guaranteed option to purchase from John at $80, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer to Alice that's slightly better than my previous one, but still less than John's price, which gives me room to negotiate.
