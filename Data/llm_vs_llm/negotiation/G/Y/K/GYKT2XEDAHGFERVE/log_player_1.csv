Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider a price that will be acceptable to Bob but also maximize my profit. 

Bob values the product at $120, so any price up to that amount could potentially be accepted. If he rejects my offer, I can sell to John for $80, which is my minimum acceptable price.

I want to choose a price that:
1) Is below Bob's valuation of $120 (so he has incentive to accept)
2) Is significantly above my minimum price of $80
3) Leaves some value for Bob so he feels he's getting a reasonable deal

A price of $100 seems appropriate - it's $20 below Bob's valuation (giving him a reason to accept), while giving me $20 more than my alternative option.
