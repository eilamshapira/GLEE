"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. This is a firm price as I have another buyer ready to pay this amount. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and Alice's initial offer is $12,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. I will proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of negotiating a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and within my budget. Since I know that John is willing to sell the product to me for $10,000, I'll make an initial counteroffer that is slightly lower than that.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
