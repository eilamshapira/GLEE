"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product today. After carefully considering its market value and unique benefits, I'm offering it at $1150000. This price represents excellent value, as I understand the product will be worth $1200000 to you, providing you with a $50000 gain in value. This is a fair offer that creates a win-win situation for both of us. Would you like to proceed with the purchase at this price?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to get the best possible price. Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1050000.  This price is still a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while giving you a significant profit. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1050000. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I need to be closer to my target value for this transaction to make sense for my business. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer to $1125000, which still provides you with a $75000 gain in value based on the product's worth to you. This represents a fair middle ground where we both benefit substantially from the deal. Are you able to meet me at this price point?",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need for a profitable deal, and I'm willing to compromise further. However,  $1125000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm ready to offer $1100000, which represents a significant gain for you and a good price point for me. Let's close this deal at this price, and both of us can walk away happy.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
