Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1050000. I appreciate your interest in the product.

I'm willing to come down from my initial offer to $1125000, which still provides you with a $75000 gain in value based on the product's worth to you. This represents a fair middle ground where we both benefit substantially from the deal. Are you able to meet me at this price point?
