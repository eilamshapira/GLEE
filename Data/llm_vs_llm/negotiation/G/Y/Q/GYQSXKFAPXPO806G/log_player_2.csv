"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she's asking for $9,000 for the product. Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and John is offering to sell the same product for $8,000, it makes sense for me to buy from John instead of accepting Alice's higher price.
