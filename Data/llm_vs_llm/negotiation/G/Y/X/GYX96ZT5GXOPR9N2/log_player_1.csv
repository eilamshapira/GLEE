Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe this product is exciting, but $20000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious purchase if we can settle at $10000. Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. My counteroffer will be $17,500. This price still reflects the product's value and gives Bob a chance to reconsider his budget. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to propose $17,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?""}"
