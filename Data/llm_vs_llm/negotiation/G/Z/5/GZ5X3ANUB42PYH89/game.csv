"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly exceptional product. It represents a unique asset with unparalleled potential. My initial offer is $2500000.",2500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2.5 million is significantly above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and requirements, I would like to make a counteroffer of $900000. This is a fair price that reflects the current market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is far below the intrinsic value and potential returns this product offers. While I appreciate your interest, I can't accept that. However, I'm willing to come down a bit. Let's meet closer to the middle. My counteroffer is $2300000.",2300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving down in price, but $2.3 million is still significantly above what I can justify for this product. I understand you value it highly, but I need to be realistic about my budget and the market. I can increase my offer to $1050000, which represents a substantial commitment from my side.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. I acknowledge your budget constraints, but I also have a minimum acceptable price. I am willing to lower my offer to $2100000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it reflects a willingness to negotiate in good faith.",2100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I need to be completely transparent with you. I have a firm maximum budget of $1200000 for this product, which is in line with market alternatives. I can offer you $1150000, which is very close to my absolute maximum. If we can't come to an agreement near this price point, I will unfortunately need to pursue other options.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
