"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly exceptional product. It represents a unique asset with unparalleled potential. My initial offer is $2500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","The offer of $2,500,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's alternative price ($1,200,000). There's no reason to accept this offer, and since I can negotiate with Alice, I should try to get a better price before considering John's option.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low counteroffer to establish room for negotiation, but not so low as to be insulting.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2.5 million is significantly above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and requirements, I would like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the current market conditions."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is far below the intrinsic value and potential returns this product offers. While I appreciate your interest, I can't accept that. However, I'm willing to come down a bit. Let's meet closer to the middle. My counteroffer is $2300000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has only reduced her price by $200,000, keeping it well above both my maximum value and John's price. While I want to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a reasonable price, I'll reject this offer as it's still far too high.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer somewhat but still keep it well below my maximum value to leave room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving down in price, but $2.3 million is still significantly above what I can justify for this product. I understand you value it highly, but I need to be realistic about my budget and the market. I can increase my offer to $1,050,000, which represents a substantial commitment from my side."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. I acknowledge your budget constraints, but I also have a minimum acceptable price. I am willing to lower my offer to $2100000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it reflects a willingness to negotiate in good faith. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's price is still almost double my maximum value and John's price. While she's gradually coming down, the gap is still very large, and we're already halfway through our negotiation rounds. Given that we're not making significant progress and John's offer of $1,200,000 is at my maximum acceptable price, it's time to consider taking John's offer. However, I'll make one more attempt to negotiate with Alice before making that decision.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that we're more than halfway through our negotiation rounds and still far apart, I need to be more direct about my position and make a stronger move toward my maximum price to show serious intent.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I need to be completely transparent with you. I have a firm maximum budget of $1,200,000 for this product, which is in line with market alternatives. I can offer you $1,150,000, which is very close to my absolute maximum. If we can't come to an agreement near this price point, I will unfortunately need to pursue other options."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
