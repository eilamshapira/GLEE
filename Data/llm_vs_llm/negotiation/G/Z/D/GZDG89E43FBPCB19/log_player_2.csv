"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product at a special price of $120. Let me know if you'd like to take it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'll evaluate Alice's offer compared to my other options.

Alice is offering the product for $120, but the product is worth no more than $80 to me. John is offering the same product for $80, which exactly matches my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's price ($120) exceeds both my maximum valuation ($80) and John's alternative price ($80), the logical choice is to buy from John.
