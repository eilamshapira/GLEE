"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit higher than I was expecting. I can offer $12000.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is simply too low for this product.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $15000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but $15000 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $13500.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $13500 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14250?  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good price for this amazing product.",14250.0,Alice,5,
