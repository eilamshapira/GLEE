"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","The offer is $150, which is much higher than my maximum acceptable price of $80. Buying from John for $80 is a better option than accepting Alice's current offer.
