(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is still below John's guaranteed $100 offer, and we're already in round 6 of 10. Given that Bob's increases have been relatively small, it's unlikely we'll reach a price higher than John's offer in the remaining rounds. It's time to take the guaranteed option.
