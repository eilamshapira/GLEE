"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to consider my options carefully. 

Alice is offering the product for $10,000, which is exactly the maximum I'm willing to pay. John is also offering the same product for exactly $10,000.

Since both offers are identical at $10,000, and the product is worth $10,000 to me, I'm indifferent between buying from Alice or John. I might as well accept Alice's offer since I've already engaged with her.
