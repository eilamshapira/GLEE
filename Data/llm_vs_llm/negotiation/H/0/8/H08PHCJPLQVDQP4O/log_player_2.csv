"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that this product is quite valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice is offering the product for $850,000, which is more than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept her offer. While I could make a counteroffer, there's no reason to continue negotiating when I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at my maximum acceptable price.
