"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is less than John's price of $1,200,000, but still seems high considering Alice's product is worth $1,000,000 to her, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer. There's room for negotiation to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's above Alice's cost ($1,000,000) but significantly below her initial offer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has lowered her price from $1,150,000 to $1,125,000, showing she's willing to negotiate. However, there might still be room for a better deal since her cost is $1,000,000. I'll reject this offer and try one more counter.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still try to get a good deal, aiming for a middle ground between my last offer ($1,050,000) and Alice's latest offer ($1,125,000).

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $1,150,000 to $1,100,000, which is a reasonable price. It's $100,000 better than John's price, and given that we've gone through several rounds of negotiation, this seems like a fair deal that gives both parties a reasonable margin. I'll accept this offer.
