"Hello Bob, I have a quality product that I'm offering for sale. Given its features and value, I'm setting the price at $200. This is a fair market price for a product of this caliber. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I've done some market research, and I can find similar products for much less. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. This is a fair price considering the market conditions.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is significantly below the product's value. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to ensure I'm not selling at a loss. The product is worth at least $150 in the current market. However, I can come down to $170 to meet you partway. This is still a very competitive price for the quality you're getting.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $170 is still much higher than what I can justify spending. I should be transparent - I can get the same product elsewhere for $100, and that's really the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $90, which would allow you to make the sale today and me to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I must clarify that my product has unique features and quality that differentiate it from what you might find elsewhere for $100. While I appreciate your continued interest, I need to be realistic about its value. Since you mentioned you can pay up to $100, and considering that I have another buyer willing to pay $120, I can offer it to you at $140 - still providing you better value than what's available in the market. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents my best price at this point.",140.0,Alice,5,
