"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'm evaluating Alice's offer of $1,200,000 for the product. 

This price is exactly equal to the maximum I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000) and identical to what John is offering. Since both options cost the same, there's no advantage to buying from John immediately.

However, if I reject Alice's offer, I can make a counteroffer at a lower price, which gives me a chance to save money. There's no downside to trying to negotiate since I can always fall back on John's $1,200,000 offer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that gives me room to negotiate but is still reasonable.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has now offered the product at $1,000,000, which is $200,000 less than both her initial offer and John's price. This is a significant improvement and represents substantial savings compared to my maximum budget.

Since this price is well below my maximum willingness to pay ($1,200,000), and I might not get a better offer if I continue negotiating, I'll accept this offer.
