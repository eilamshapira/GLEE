"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given the situation:

*   **Your Valuation:** $1,200,000 (maximum you'd pay)
*   **Alice's Cost:** $800,000
*   **Alice's Offer:** $1,100,000
*   **John's Offer:** $1,200,000

Since Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum valuation of $1,200,000, and you can potentially negotiate a lower price in subsequent rounds, but not sure, it is better to consider the trade with Alice. Buying from John is a bad option because John's offer is higher than Alice's offer, and you can also negotiate to possibly get a better price.
You should choose to Reject Alice's Offer and proceed to the next round.

**Decision: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, I want to start with a reasonable counteroffer. Given that Alice's cost is $800,000 and her initial offer was $1,100,000, I'll aim to get the price down significantly, but not so low that she immediately rejects it. I'll propose a price somewhere in between.

**Counteroffer:**

```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Okay, let's analyze the situation in Round 3:

*   **Your Valuation:** $1,200,000
*   **Alice's Offer:** $1,075,000
*   **John's Offer:** $1,200,000

Alice has lowered her price from her initial offer, and it's still within my budget. Since the price is now lower than the first offer, and significantly better than John's offer, I'll consider if this is the best deal I can get. I still have several rounds left for negotiation. My goal is to save as much money as possible. Since it is still worth to negotiate with Alice, I'll reject the offer.

**Decision: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, Alice rejected my previous offer, and she's lowered her price. Now, I'll make a slightly more aggressive counteroffer, but still aiming for a price Alice might accept. I want to be closer to what Alice bought the product for, and I will aim for a price less than $1,000,000.

**Counteroffer:**

```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let's assess the situation in Round 5:

*   **Your Valuation:** $1,200,000
*   **Alice's Offer:** $1,025,000
*   **John's Offer:** $1,200,000

Alice has lowered her price further. Now is the time to evaluate how much more I want to push the negotiations. If I reject again, I am not sure if Alice will provide me with a better offer. Since I have rejected two offers before, I can offer Alice another counter offer.

**Decision: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, I've rejected Alice's offers a couple of times now. I'm going to try a more moderate approach this round, to avoid pushing her away entirely. I'll aim for a price that is a good deal for me, but hopefully still acceptable to her.

**Counteroffer:**

```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```"
