"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12500. This is a great price, as I'm confident you'll see the significant value it holds. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to evaluate this offer carefully:

- The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
- Alice is offering it for $12,500
- John (alternative seller) is willing to sell it for $12,000

Since Alice's offer ($12,500) exceeds both the product's value to me ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000), it makes financial sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John.
