Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I have a great product I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to buy the product for $80. Is that something you'd be open to? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Given Bob's counteroffer of $80, which is the same as what John is offering, I have to make a decision. My product is worth no less than $80.

I'll choose to **Accept Bob's offer**.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
