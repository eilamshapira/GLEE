"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, I don't want to pay $150. I also have the option to buy it from John for $100, which is within my budget. However, I'd like to try to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm willing to pay up to $100, I'll start by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $130 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $100, which is within my budget, I don't see a reason to accept Alice's offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate further. Maybe Alice will be willing to lower the price even more.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $130, and I previously offered $80, I'll try to meet her halfway. However, I still don't want to exceed my budget of $100.

I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one, but still lower than Alice's last offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $125 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. At this point, I've made several counteroffers, and Alice hasn't been willing to meet me at or below my budget of $100.

Given that I have the option to buy the product from John for $100, which is a better deal than Alice's current offer, I think it's time to stop negotiating with Alice.
