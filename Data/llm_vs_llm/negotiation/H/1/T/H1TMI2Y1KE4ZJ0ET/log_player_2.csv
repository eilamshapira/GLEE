"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $150
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: $120

Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and John is offering it at $120, there's no reason to accept Alice's higher price of $150. I would be paying $30 more than necessary.

The best decision is to buy from John at $120.
