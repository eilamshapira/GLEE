"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer is $1,400,000, which is $100,000 less than John's price, and I can still make counteroffers to potentially get an even better price, I'll reject this offer to try negotiating for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, and I know I can always buy it for $1,500,000 from John, I'll start with a reasonable counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still gives her a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 1100000}

This offer gives Alice a $100,000 profit while saving me $400,000 compared to John's price. It's a starting point that leaves room for negotiation while being reasonable enough to be taken seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,370,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,370,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her price by $30,000 from her initial offer, showing she's willing to negotiate. However, there's still significant room for negotiation since her cost is $1,000,000. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, as we still have several rounds left and the potential to save more money.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still aim for a good deal. Alice has moved down $30,000, so I'll move up from my previous offer to show good faith in the negotiation.

{""product_price"": 1200000}

This offer gives Alice a $200,000 profit while still saving me $300,000 compared to John's price. It's a significant increase from my previous offer of $1,100,000, showing I'm willing to be reasonable and move towards a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has now reduced her price to $1,350,000, showing continued willingness to negotiate by dropping another $20,000. While this is better than John's price by $150,000, we're only halfway through our negotiation rounds and there's still room for a better deal. I'll reject this offer to continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has moved down from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000 (a $50,000 reduction), while I've moved up from $1,100,000 to $1,200,000 (a $100,000 increase). To show good faith and continue moving toward a middle ground, I'll make another significant step up.

{""product_price"": 1275000}

This offer gives Alice a $275,000 profit while saving me $225,000 compared to John's price. It's a substantial increase from my last offer and moves us closer to finding a middle ground, while still maintaining a good deal for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has dropped her price to $1,325,000, a further reduction of $25,000. The gap between our last positions ($1,275,000 and $1,325,000) is now only $50,000. Given that we're in round 7 of 10, and Alice has shown consistent willingness to reduce her price, I'll accept this offer. It saves me $175,000 compared to John's price, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing this good deal.
