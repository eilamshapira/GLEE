Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 119}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $90 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($80), but lower than what I initially offered ($119), I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

My counteroffer will be $110.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new offer is: {""product_price"": 110}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer of $95 is still lower than what I'm aiming for, but it's getting closer. Since I know the product is worth $120 to Bob, I'll try to get a better price.

I'll reject Bob's offer of $95 and make a new counteroffer. My new offer will be $105.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new offer is: {""product_price"": 105}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer of $100 is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept, and it's higher than my minimum price of $80. Considering that Bob's offer is still lower than what the product is worth to him ($120), I might be able to get a slightly better price. However, the risk of losing the sale and having to sell to John for $80 is also a consideration.

I'll reject Bob's offer of $100 and make a new counteroffer, trying to split the difference between my previous offer and Bob's current offer. My new offer will be $102.50.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new offer is: {""product_price"": 102.50}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.
