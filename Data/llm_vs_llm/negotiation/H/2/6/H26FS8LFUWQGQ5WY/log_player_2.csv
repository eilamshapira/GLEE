"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to make a decision based on the options available.

I'm looking for a product that is worth no more than $8,000 to me.

Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which exceeds my maximum valuation.

John is offering the same product for $8,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, I should buy from John.
