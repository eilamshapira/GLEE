"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit below what I know Bob is willing to pay, but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This should give me room to negotiate and hopefully close the deal at a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, but I'm not ready to settle for John's offer yet. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but still leaving room for a profitable deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still a bit lower than I would like, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Given the limited rounds and the chance to sell to John, I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to secure a sale."
