"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a very unique and valuable product. I'm confident it's worth at least $15000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to the right buyer. I'm open to discussing a fair price. My initial offer is $20000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The product is only worth $8,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $20,000. That's way too high. Buying from John for $8,000 is a much better option than paying $20,000 to Alice.
