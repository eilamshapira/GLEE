"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $100 is the absolute minimum I could accept, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, given the quality and value of this product, I can reduce my price to $130, which I believe is quite reasonable. Would that work for you?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the new offer, but $130 is still a bit high for me. Since you mentioned $100 as your absolute minimum, I'll meet you at that price. How about we settle on $100? It seems like a fair deal for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
