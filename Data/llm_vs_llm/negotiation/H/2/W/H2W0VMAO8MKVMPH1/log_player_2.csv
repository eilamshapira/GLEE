Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $100 is the absolute minimum I could accept, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, given the quality and value of this product, I can reduce my price to $130, which I believe is quite reasonable. Would that work for you?
