Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. Since I know:
1. The product is worth at least $10,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $10,000
3. Bob's valuation is unknown but could be higher

I should offer a price significantly above $10,000 to maximize my potential profit. If Bob rejects, I lose nothing since I can still sell to John. I'll set a notably higher price to test Bob's willingness to pay.
