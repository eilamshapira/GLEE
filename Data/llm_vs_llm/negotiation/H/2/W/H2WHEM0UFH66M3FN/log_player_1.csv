"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer, considering the product is worth $150 to Bob and no less than $100 to me. This gives room for negotiation while potentially maximizing my profit.

{""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","I'll reject Bob's offer of $110 since it's too close to my minimum acceptable price of $100, and we still have 8 rounds left for negotiation. There's room to get a better price from Bob, considering the product is worth $150 to him.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial $140, but still maintain a good margin considering Bob's first counteroffer and the product's value to him.

{""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob has increased his offer by $5, showing some willingness to negotiate upward. However, with 6 rounds remaining and the product being worth $150 to him, I believe there's still room for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll reduce my asking price further, but still maintain a good position for negotiation. Bob has shown willingness to increase his price, so I'll try to meet somewhere in the middle.

{""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob has increased his offer again to $120, which is a reasonable price. While we could continue negotiating, there's also a risk that Bob might get frustrated and walk away. With $120 being significantly better than John's $100 offer, and considering we've already gone through 6 rounds, I'll accept this offer.
