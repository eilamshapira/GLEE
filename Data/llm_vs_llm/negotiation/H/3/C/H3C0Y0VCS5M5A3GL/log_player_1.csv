"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product and I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a high offer.

Round 2

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and also lower than the minimum amount I'm willing to accept ($1,500,000), I will reject Bob's offer. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safer option, but I still want to try to negotiate a better price with Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $750,000, which is lower than my target, I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my initial offer, but still keep it high to maximize my earnings.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $1,000,000, I'll try to find a middle ground between his offer and the price I'm aiming for. Considering John's offer of $1,500,000 is still on the table, I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still higher.

At this point, I'm starting to think that Bob might not be willing to pay more than $1,200,000, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with John.
