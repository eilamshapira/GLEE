"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you think $140 is too high, but I'm afraid $70 is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, so I'll meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. Let's try $105.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $105 is still a bit high for me. I can offer $85 for the product.",85.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. Since you've increased your offer to $85, I'm willing to decrease mine slightly. Let's try $100. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value.",100.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price. I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I still think the product is worth a bit more. Let's try $95. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and close the deal.",95.0,Alice,7,
