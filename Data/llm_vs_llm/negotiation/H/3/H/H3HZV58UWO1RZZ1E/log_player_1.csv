Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Considering its rarity and quality, I'm asking for $25,000."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $25000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10000. Would you consider $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
