Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $5,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value of $15,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $15,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I am willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer is $18,000.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's new offer of $7,000 is still lower than the minimum value of $15,000 that the product is worth to me. Since I have the option to sell it to John for $15,000, which is more than twice Bob's offer, I will not accept Bob's offer.

At this point, I will reject Bob's offer again and consider making another counteroffer, but I will also keep in mind the option to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob does not improve significantly.

My decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I will make a new counteroffer: {""product_price"": 17000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $8,500 is still lower than the minimum value of $15,000 that the product is worth to me, but it's getting closer to a reasonable range. However, it's still significantly lower than my previous counteroffer of $17,000 and the current counteroffer I have in mind.

Considering the gap between Bob's offer and my desired price, and the fact that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, I will reject Bob's offer again.

My decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I will make a new counteroffer: {""product_price"": 16000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 16000}"
