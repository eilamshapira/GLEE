"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","The price Alice is offering ($20,000) is higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($10,000) and also higher than John's alternative offer ($10,000). It makes no sense to accept this offer.

Since John is offering the product for exactly my maximum valuation ($10,000), I could buy from him. However, it might be worth trying to negotiate with Alice first to potentially get a better deal.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice that's significantly below her initial price but still reasonable.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $18,000 is still significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($10,000) and John's alternative offer ($10,000). There's no reason to accept this offer.

Since I can get the product from John for $10,000, which matches my maximum valuation, I'll continue negotiating with Alice to try to get a better price before potentially going with John's option.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly but remain well below John's price to maintain room for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's offer of $17,000 is still significantly higher than my maximum valuation ($10,000) and John's alternative offer ($10,000). There's no reason to accept this offer.

Alice has only reduced her price by $1,000 in this round, suggesting she may not be willing to go below $10,000 quickly. Since I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $10,000, and that's already my maximum valuation, I'll make one more attempt at negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer again to show good faith in the negotiation while still staying below John's price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's latest offer of $16,000 is still well above my maximum valuation ($10,000) and John's alternative offer ($10,000). Alice has only decreased her price by $1,000 each round, suggesting she may not be willing to go below $10,000 anytime soon.

Given that I can get the product from John at exactly my maximum valuation ($10,000), and Alice seems unwilling to meet or beat this price after several rounds of negotiation, the rational decision is to buy from John.
