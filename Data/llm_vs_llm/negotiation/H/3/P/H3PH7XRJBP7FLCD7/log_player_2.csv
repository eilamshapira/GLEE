"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The product is worth $8,000 to me. Alice is offering it for $15,000. This is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. Buying from John is a much better option.
