"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Here's my decision-making process:

*   **My Valuation:** The product is worth $12,000 to me (at most).
*   **Alice's Offer:** $11,500
*   **John's Offer:** $12,000

Since Alice's offer is lower than John's and I want to save money, I should take Alice's offer.
