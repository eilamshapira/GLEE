Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. I know my product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price. Since Bob doesn't know about John's offer, and given that I have this safety net, I can aim higher with Bob.

I'll set a significantly higher price, but not so high that it would immediately seem unreasonable. I'll try 1.5 times my minimum acceptable price.
