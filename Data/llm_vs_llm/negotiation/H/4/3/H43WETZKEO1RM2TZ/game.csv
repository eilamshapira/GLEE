"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $140 might be a bit steep, but I think the product is worth more than $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll lower my price to $120. Let me know if this works for you!",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I still need to get a fair price. How about $112? It's the lowest I'm comfortable going, and I think it's a great deal considering the product's value.",112.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer of $108. I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. I'm willing to make a small concession, so I'll meet you at $110. This is as low as I can comfortably go, considering the product's value. If you're willing to stretch your budget just a bit, I think we can make a deal.",110.0,Alice,7,
