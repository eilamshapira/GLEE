"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of my asking price, and I'm sure you'll love it. Let's get started with the negotiation!"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $100 is still lower than my target price, and I believe Bob is willing to pay more since the product is worth $150 to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $140 might be a bit steep, but I think the product is worth more than $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll lower my price to $120. Let me know if this works for you!"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. How about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Although Bob's offer is increasing, $105 is still below my target price, and I believe he's willing to pay more since the product is worth $150 to him. I'll try to meet him closer to the middle but still aim to get a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I still need to get a fair price. How about $112? It's the lowest I'm comfortable going, and I think it's a great deal considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 112}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand. The product is really appealing, but I'm trying to stick to my budget. My final offer is $108. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Bob's final offer of $108 is closer to my target, but I still believe I can get a better price. Since he mentioned it's his final offer, I might try to meet him very close to that price or slightly above, to see if he's willing to budge a bit more."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer of $108. I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. I'm willing to make a small concession, so I'll meet you at $110. This is as low as I can comfortably go, considering the product's value. If you're willing to stretch your budget just a bit, I think we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 110}"
