"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I understand the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1500000, which is still below the value I place on the product. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1500000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your new offer. How about $1350000? I think this is a reasonable compromise.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, but $1350000 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $1400000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $1400000 is getting closer to my target, but I still need to bring it down a bit. I'm willing to offer $1375000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I hope this can be a mutually beneficial price.",1375000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer to an agreement.  While $1375000 is getting closer, I need to stay above $1400000. How about we split the difference and go with $1387500? I think this is a fair compromise that reflects both our needs.",1387500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your creative suggestion to split the difference. However, I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $1380000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer and very close to your suggested compromise. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1380000.0,Bob,8,
