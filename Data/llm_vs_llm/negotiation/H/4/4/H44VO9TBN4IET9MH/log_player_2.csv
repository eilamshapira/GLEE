"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $15000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","After reviewing Alice's offer, I need to make a decision based on my goal to buy the product while saving as much money as possible.

Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is $7,000 more than the product is worth to me (which is no more than $8,000).

John is offering to sell the same product for $8,000, which is within my maximum value for the product.

Since my goal is to save money and I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at a much lower price, the logical choice is to go with John's offer.
