"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm really interested in the product though. Would you be willing to come down to $12000? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm glad you're interested. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $14000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to work with me.",14000.0,Bob,4,
