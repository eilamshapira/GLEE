Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm really interested in the product though. Would you be willing to come down to $12000? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will make a counteroffer to Bob. My new offer is: 
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm glad you're interested. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $14000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to work with me.

Since Bob's offer of $14,000 is lower than John's offer of $15,000, I will choose to sell the product to John for the higher price."
