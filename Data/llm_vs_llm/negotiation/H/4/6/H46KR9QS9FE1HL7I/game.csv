"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $1150000 is a bit high for me. Given the market conditions, I think $1050000 would be a more reasonable price. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more aligned with my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
