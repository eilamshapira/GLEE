"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product.  I know you'll recognize its true value.  How about we start the conversation at $1150000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer is $1,150,000
2. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice
3. My maximum value is $1,200,000
4. I can buy from John for $1,200,000 at any time
5. I have 10 rounds to negotiate

Alice's initial offer of $1,150,000 is lower than John's price ($1,200,000), but there's still room for negotiation since I know her cost is $1,000,000. It would be wise to try negotiating for a better price since we have plenty of rounds left and Alice might be willing to go lower.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but leaves room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, I'll start with an offer that's above her cost but significantly below her asking price.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. Given the market conditions, I think $1,050,000 would be a more reasonable price. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more aligned with my budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm confident this product is worth more than your valuation.  How about we meet in the middle at $1100000?  This feels like a fair price that acknowledges its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

1. Alice has moved down from $1,150,000 to $1,100,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. The $1,100,000 price is:
   - $100,000 above her cost ($1,000,000)
   - $100,000 below my initial maximum ($1,200,000)
   - $50,000 above my previous counteroffer ($1,050,000)

This is actually a pretty reasonable offer. While we could continue negotiating, there's risk in pushing too hard:
1. We might waste rounds and end up with a worse deal
2. Alice might become less flexible
3. The current offer already saves me $100,000 compared to John's price

Given that this is a fair middle ground and represents significant savings from my maximum price, I'll accept this offer.
