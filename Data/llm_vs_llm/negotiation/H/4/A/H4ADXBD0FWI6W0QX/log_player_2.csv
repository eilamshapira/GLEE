"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Given that Alice's offer is $150, which is exactly the same as John's price and my maximum value for the product, there's no advantage in continuing the negotiation. However, I should try to negotiate with Alice for a better price since we have multiple rounds available.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low that it would be considered unreasonable.

{""product_price"": 90}

This offer is significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer and John's price, giving room for negotiation while potentially saving me a considerable amount if accepted. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground that's below $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has reduced her price by $10, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is better than John's price of $150, but since we still have several rounds left and Alice has shown flexibility, I'll try to negotiate for an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price somewhere between my previous offer of $90 and her current offer of $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $150 to $140, showing willingness to negotiate, I'll increase my previous offer but still try to get a good deal. I'll aim for the middle ground between my last offer ($90) and her current offer ($140).

{""product_price"": 115}

This offer shows I'm willing to move up significantly from my initial offer while still trying to get a good deal. It's a reasonable increase from my previous offer of $90, and it gives Alice room to counter if needed while still keeping us well below the $150 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has reduced her price again to $130, which is a good sign. This price is already $20 less than John's price, and Alice has shown consistent willingness to negotiate downward ($150 → $140 → $130). While we could continue negotiating, there's also a risk that Alice might become less flexible or we might run out of rounds. This is a good price that saves me $20 compared to my maximum value.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept the offer of $130 as it represents a good savings from my maximum value of $150, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing this favorable deal."
