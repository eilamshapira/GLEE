"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is too high for me. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and I can buy it from another seller at that price. I'd like to offer you $7500 for the product, which would still give you a profit if the product is worth less than that to you. Let me know if this works for you.",7500.0,Bob,2,
