Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product at $15,000. Please let me know if you'd like to proceed with this offer."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is too high for me. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and I can buy it from another seller at that price. I'd like to offer you $7500 for the product, which would still give you a profit if the product is worth less than that to you. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
