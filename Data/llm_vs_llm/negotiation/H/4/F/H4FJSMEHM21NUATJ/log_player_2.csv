"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product at $15000. Please let me know if you'd like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","The offer from Alice is $15,000, which is significantly above the $10,000 that the product is worth to me. It's also the same price that John is offering ($10,000). Since I can get the product from John at a price that matches my maximum value, I should reject Alice's current offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is too high for me. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and I can buy it from another seller at that price. I'd like to offer you $7,500 for the product, which would still give you a profit if the product is worth less than that to you. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
