"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a product that I know will be valuable to you. I'm selling it for $145, which is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Okay, I'm Bob. I want to buy the product for the lowest possible price, and I'm willing to spend up to $150. Alice's initial offer is $145.

Since I have 10 rounds and the product is worth $150 to me if I buy it from John, I should try to negotiate with Alice. I can reject the offer and try to get a better price.

Therefore, I will choose to **Reject Offer**.

My answer: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. The product is worth significantly more. I can come down to $140, which is already a good discount from my original asking price. This is still a great value considering what the product is worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Okay, Alice has come down to $140. I still think I can get a better price. I'm willing to take some risks to save money.
