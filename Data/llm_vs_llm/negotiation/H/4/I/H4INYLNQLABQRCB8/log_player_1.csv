Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he's not, we can negotiate down from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $900,000.  I'll try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,200,000. This is still a significant discount from my original offer, but it's a fair starting point for further negotiation."
