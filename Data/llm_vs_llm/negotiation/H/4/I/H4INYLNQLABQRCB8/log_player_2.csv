"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to consider my options carefully. 

Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000, which is actually $300,000 higher than my maximum valuation of $1,200,000. I would be losing money if I accepted this offer.

I know I can buy from John for $1,200,000 at any time, which matches my maximum valuation. However, I should try to negotiate with Alice first to see if I can get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that gives me room to negotiate while still being potentially attractive to Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has now offered the product for $1,200,000, which is exactly the same price as John's offer and matches my maximum valuation.

Since Alice has come down significantly from her initial $1,500,000 offer to match John's price, and I can't get better than my maximum valuation of $1,200,000, this is a reasonable deal to accept.

While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice could increase her price again, and John's alternative remains at $1,200,000. Given this is already at my maximum acceptable price, I'll accept Alice's current offer.
