"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $50. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for this price?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $50 is far too low for this product. Given its quality and value, I cannot go below $175. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would you be willing to reconsider at this price?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand that you can't go as low as $50, but $175 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $112.50? This is the highest I'm comfortable going.",112.5,Bob,4,
