Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it for $200. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $50. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $50 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and significantly lower than my initial offer, I should reject it. The fact that I have John willing to pay $150 gives me a strong negotiating position. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but if we can't reach an agreement above $150, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $50 is far too low for this product. Given its quality and value, I cannot go below $175. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would you be willing to reconsider at this price?"", ""product_price"": 175}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand that you can't go as low as $50, but $175 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $112.50? This is the highest I'm comfortable going. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's maximum offer ($112.50) is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer of $150, and the product is worth no less than $150 to me, it makes the most economic sense to sell to John. Bob has indicated this is his highest offer, so continuing negotiations would likely be futile, and I would be losing money by accepting his offer."
