"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $1200000 is lower than my initial asking price, I am willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle, at $1600000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering we're trying to meet in the middle, I'd like to propose a price of $1400000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
