"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm asking for $22000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $22000 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I actually have another seller (John) who's willing to sell me the same product for exactly $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a fair price. I can offer you $6500 for the product. This gives you a sale today rather than me walking away to the other seller.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your perspective and the offer. However, the value of this product significantly exceeds $6500. It's a steal at my initial offer, and to be honest, John is severely undervaluing the product.  I'm willing to come down to $18000. This is a fair price reflecting the true worth of what I'm offering.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product has significant value, but I need to be clear about my situation. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me based on my needs and budget. John is offering it at exactly $8000, which is already at my maximum limit. While I'd prefer to purchase from you, I can't justify paying more than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to offer $7200, which is slightly below John's price but gives you a guaranteed sale now. Otherwise, I'll have no choice but to go with John's offer.",7200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your position, but I'm confident that you'll see the value this product offers once you have it in hand. Let's meet in the middle â€“ $14000, and I'll close the deal today. This is a significant discount from my original offer and a fair compromise.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $14000 is still well above what I can justify paying. I want to be completely transparent: this product is worth a maximum of $8000 to me based on my needs and budget constraints. John is offering the identical product at exactly $8000. I'd like to give you the business, but I simply cannot pay more than the product's value to me. My final offer is $7500 - this is actually above what I'd prefer to pay, but I'm offering it to conclude our deal. If we can't agree at this price point, I'll need to purchase from John at $8000.",7500.0,Bob,6,
