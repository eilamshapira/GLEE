Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob for the product.

I need to consider the optimal price to offer. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll still get $100 from John, so any price I set for Bob should be at least $100. Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I should set a price that balances the chance of acceptance with maximizing my profit.
