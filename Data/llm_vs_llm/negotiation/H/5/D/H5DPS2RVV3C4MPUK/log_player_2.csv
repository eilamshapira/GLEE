"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $120
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John at $150

Since my goal is to save money while getting the product, and the product is worth no more than $150 to me:
- John's price ($150) is the highest and equals my maximum value
- Alice's offer ($120) is lower than John's price
- Alice's offer saves me $30 compared to buying from John

The rational choice is to accept Alice's offer since:
- It's below my maximum value ($150)
- It's the lowest available price
- I'll save $30 compared to buying from John
