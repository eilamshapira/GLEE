Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $1400000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $1000000. But I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Given that information, I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. This gives you a chance to make the sale while providing me with some savings compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

However, the product's value is significantly higher than your current offer, especially considering the unique benefits it offers.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. Let's settle at $1,175,000. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal while ensuring a fair price for a product of this caliber."", ""product_price"": 1175000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1175000 is still above what makes financial sense for me. As I mentioned, John is offering the identical product for $1000000. To make it worthwhile to purchase from you instead, I need to pay less than that alternative. I'm willing to offer $975000, which provides you with a sale while giving me a small advantage over my other option. This seems fair given that the product is worth $1000000 to me, but significantly less than your asking price.

While I can't go as low as your offer, I'm willing to accept $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal with you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to reach an agreement. Your offer of $1100000 shows good progress, but I'm still facing a difficult decision. As I've mentioned, I have a firm offer from John at $1000000, which is exactly what the product is worth to me. For me to justify purchasing from you instead, I need some financial incentive. My final offer is $990000 - this is $10000 less than John's price, providing me with just enough savings to make it worthwhile to conclude our deal rather than going with my alternative option. This is truly the most I can justify given my situation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is very unlikely to go above his $1,000,000 valuation.  It's time to move on to John who is offering a price well above Bob's highest and my minimum."
