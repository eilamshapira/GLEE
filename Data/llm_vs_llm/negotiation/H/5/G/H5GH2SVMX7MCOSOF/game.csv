"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I can actually get the same item from another seller for $120. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $90 for the product, which gives you a quick sale and saves me the trouble of going elsewhere. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must say that $90 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. I understand that you mentioned you can get it elsewhere for $120, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $130, which is still a competitive price. Let me know if this works for you.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $130 is still more than the $120 I can pay to the other seller. Since I'd prefer to work with you, I'm willing to offer $105 for the product. This gives you a slightly better price than my alternative while still being a good deal for me. Does that work for you?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. Considering your offer of $105 and my previous price of $130, I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you the product for $125, which is still a good deal for both of us. Additionally, I'll throw in a small bonus - I'll cover the shipping costs, so you won't have to pay anything extra. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $125 and offering to cover shipping. That's definitely getting closer. However, I still need to keep my budget in mind. The other seller is offering $120, and that's really my ceiling for this purchase. To make it worth your while and close the deal now, I can offer you $115. This is $5 less than my alternative, and I'd prefer to purchase from you if we can agree on this price. What do you say?",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $115. I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget to purchase from me. Considering we're very close to a deal, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I can offer you the product for $120, which matches the price you mentioned the other seller is offering. This way, you'll get the product from me, and I'll get a fair price for it. Let's close the deal at $120, and I'll still cover the shipping costs as previously mentioned.",120.0,Alice,7,
