Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I can actually get the same item from another seller for $120. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $90 for the product, which gives you a quick sale and saves me the trouble of going elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must say that $90 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $130 is still more than the $120 I can pay to the other seller. Since I'd prefer to work with you, I'm willing to offer $105 for the product. This gives you a slightly better price than my alternative while still being a good deal for me. Does that work for you?

Considering your offer of $105 and my previous price of $130, I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you the product for $125, which is still a good deal for both of us. Additionally, I'll throw in a small bonus - I'll cover the shipping costs, so you won't have to pay anything extra.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $125 and offering to cover shipping. That's definitely getting closer. However, I still need to keep my budget in mind. The other seller is offering $120, and that's really my ceiling for this purchase. To make it worth your while and close the deal now, I can offer you $115. This is $5 less than my alternative, and I'd prefer to purchase from you if we can agree on this price. What do you say?
