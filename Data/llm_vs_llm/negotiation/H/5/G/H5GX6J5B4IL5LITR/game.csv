"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $8200 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to propose a price of $9200, which I believe is still a great deal for you.",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. $8700 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'd like to propose a price of $9000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,5,
