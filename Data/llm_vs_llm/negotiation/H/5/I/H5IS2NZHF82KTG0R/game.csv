"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $15000, but I'm giving you priority. I can reduce my initial price to $16000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's worth.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but $16000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $11000 to meet you halfway.",11000.0,Bob,4,
