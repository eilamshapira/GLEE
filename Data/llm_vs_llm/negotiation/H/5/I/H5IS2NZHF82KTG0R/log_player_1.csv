"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $17,500. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I was looking for a better deal. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $10,000 is too low, as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Since I still have several rounds of negotiation available and I always have John's offer as a backup, I'll try to negotiate with Bob for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $15,000, but I'm giving you priority. I can reduce my initial price to $16,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but $16000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $11000 to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll take John's offer of $15,000. Bob's latest offer of $11,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and given that the product is only worth $12,000 to Bob, it's unlikely he'll increase his offer above $15,000. John's offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, so it's the most rational choice."
