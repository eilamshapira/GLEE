Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay. Considering the options:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer:** This gives me a $50 profit, which is far less than what I want.
*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round:** This gives me a chance to get a better price.
*   **(3) Sell the product to John:** This guarantees a $150 profit.

I know the product is worth at least $150 to me. I have to consider the possibility of getting a better offer from Bob and the risk of ending up with nothing.

I will **Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 220}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Considering the options:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer:** This gives me a $60 profit, still less than what I want.
*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round:** I can try to get a better price, but risk further negotiation failures
*   **(3) Sell the product to John:** This guarantees a $150 profit.

I still have a good option, since the product is worth at least $150. I am going to take this option:
