"Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price of $250 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $80, and also much higher than John's offer. It's better to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. If negotiations with Alice don't work out, I can always buy from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 50}

I'll offer $50, which is well below John's price of $80. This gives room for negotiation while ensuring I stay below my maximum value. If Alice rejects this offer, we can continue negotiating, or I still have the option to buy from John at $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $220. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $220
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $220 is still significantly higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). While Alice has reduced the price from her initial offer of $250, it's still not close to an acceptable range. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. If Alice continues to offer prices well above $80, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 60}

I'll slightly increase my previous offer to $60. This shows some willingness to negotiate while still staying well below my maximum value of $80 and John's price. If Alice rejects this offer too, I can either continue negotiating or take John's offer at $80."
