"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking to get a good deal, so I'm starting with a price of $150. Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product but I'm only willing to go as high as $90.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be a bit high, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to come down to $120. Let me know if that works for you.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $120 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
