Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking to get a good deal, so I'm starting with a price of $150. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product but I'm only willing to go as high as $90.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to meet him at a price that's closer to my initial offer. Since Bob is interested in the product and willing to pay $90, I'll try to find a middle ground. My next offer will be $120. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be a bit high, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to come down to $120. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 120}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $120 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob is willing to pay $105, which is higher than the $100 that John is offering, and also closer to my initial price, I think it's a fair deal. I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $105."
