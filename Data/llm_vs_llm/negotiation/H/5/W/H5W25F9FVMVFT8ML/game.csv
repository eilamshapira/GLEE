"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I'm looking for a better deal. Would you be willing to sell it for a lower price? I am willing to pay $100 for the product",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $100 is a bit too low for the quality I'm offering. I can come down to $110, which I think is a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice. However, I'm still looking for a better deal. Would you consider selling it for $90? This is a price that would work better for my budget.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. I've considered your offer of $90, but I'm afraid I can't go that low. The lowest I can go is $100, which is already a significant discount from my initial price. This product is worth at least $100 given its quality and features. Does that work for you?",100.0,Alice,5,
