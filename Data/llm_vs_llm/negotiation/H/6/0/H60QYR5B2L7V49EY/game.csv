"Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire a unique product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2000000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the returns you can expect. Let me know what you think.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $2000000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000.  I believe this is a fair price considering market alternatives and the potential risks involved in such an investment.  I look forward to hearing your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, this product represents significant value, and $800000 is considerably below its true worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This revised price reflects my desire to reach an agreement while acknowledging the product's inherent value. I believe this offer balances both our interests.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  However, $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I can increase my offer to $1100000. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  If this price works, I'm ready to move forward quickly.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
