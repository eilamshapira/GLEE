Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $2000000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000.  I believe this is a fair price considering market alternatives and the potential risks involved in such an investment.  I look forward to hearing your thoughts.
