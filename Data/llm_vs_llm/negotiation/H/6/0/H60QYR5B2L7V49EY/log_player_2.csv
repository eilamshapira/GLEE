Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, this product represents significant value, and $800000 is considerably below its true worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This revised price reflects my desire to reach an agreement while acknowledging the product's inherent value. I believe this offer balances both our interests.
