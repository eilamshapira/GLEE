"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must say that $8000 is a bit lower than what I'm willing to accept. Considering the product's exceptional quality and rarity, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $11500.

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. Considering we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price, I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $11000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this amount.",11000.0,Alice,5,
