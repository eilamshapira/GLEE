"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to make a decision on Alice's offer of $20,000 for the product.

Analysis:
- The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
- Alice is offering it for $20,000, which is $5,000 more than my maximum value
- John is offering to sell the same product for $15,000
- If I accept Alice's offer, I'd be paying $5,000 more than the product is worth to me
- If I reject and make a counteroffer, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a price below $15,000
- John's guaranteed offer matches exactly the maximum I'm willing to pay

Since Alice's offer exceeds my maximum valuation and John's price exactly matches my maximum valuation, the rational choice is to buy from John.
