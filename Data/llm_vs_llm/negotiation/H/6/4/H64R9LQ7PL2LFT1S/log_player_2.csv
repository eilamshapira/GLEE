"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000). It would be unwise to accept this offer. I'll reject and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price from Alice, knowing I always have the option to buy from John at $12,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 10000}

I'll offer $10,000 to Alice. This is a reasonable counteroffer because:

1. It's below my maximum value of $12,000
2. It's below John's price of $12,000
3. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, this offer would still result in a loss for her, so she might counter with a higher price
4. It gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to buying from John"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll continue to reject as this offer ($14,000) is still higher than both:
1. My maximum value ($12,000)
2. John's guaranteed price ($12,000)

There's no reason to accept a price higher than what I can get from John. I'll make another counteroffer to see if Alice will come down to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 11000}

I'll increase my offer to $11,000. This is strategic because:

1. It's still below my maximum value of $12,000
2. It's still below John's price of $12,000
3. It shows movement from my previous offer of $10,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate
4. It's closer to Alice's cost ($12,000), which might make it more appealing to her
5. If Alice rejects this, I can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John because:

1. Alice's current offer ($13,000) is still above John's price ($12,000)
2. Even though Alice is showing movement downward in price, she's still above her cost ($12,000)
3. John's price ($12,000) is equal to my maximum value
4. Continuing to negotiate with Alice might not yield a better price than John's
5. There's no guarantee Alice will go below $12,000 since that's her cost

It's most rational to take John's guaranteed offer of $12,000 rather than continue negotiating or accept a higher price from Alice."
