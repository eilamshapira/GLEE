Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique value, I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1100000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Considering Bob's counteroffer and my own valuation, I need to make a strategic decision. Selling to John yields $1,000,000. Bob's offer is higher.

Therefore:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
