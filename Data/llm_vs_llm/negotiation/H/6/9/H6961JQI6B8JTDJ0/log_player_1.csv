"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I need to offer a price to Bob for my product. The product is worth at least $12,000 to me, and I know Bob values it at $15,000. I'll start with a price that's closer to Bob's valuation but leaves some room for negotiation if needed.

{""product_price"": $14,500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $13,000 is above my minimum threshold of $12,000, but I believe I can get more since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Selling to John for $12,000 wouldn't be optimal at this point.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that comes down from my initial price but still leaves me with a good profit, moving closer to what might be acceptable to Bob.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob has only increased his offer by $500 to $12,500, which is still quite low compared to the product's value to him. While this is above my minimum threshold, I think I can still negotiate for a better price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll continue the negotiation by coming down further from my previous offer, but still aiming for a price that's better than Bob's current offer of $12,500.

{""product_price"": $13,500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob has now decreased his offer to $12,000, which is just at my minimum threshold and equal to John's standing offer. At this point, there's no advantage to accepting Bob's offer over selling to John, and Bob seems to be negotiating in a way that suggests he might not go much higher. However, I'll make one more attempt with a final counteroffer before considering selling to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob has decreased his offer to $12,000, which is equal to John's offer, I need to make it clear that I'm looking for a better price while also being reasonable. I'll make a more modest counteroffer to try to reach an agreement.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob has now increased his offer to $12,750, which is $750 above my minimum threshold and John's standing offer. Given that we only have a few rounds left and Bob has shown willingness to increase his price, I'll accept this offer rather than risk losing the deal.
