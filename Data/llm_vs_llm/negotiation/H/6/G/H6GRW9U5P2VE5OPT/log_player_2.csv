"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze this situation:

- My maximum value for the product is $1,200,000
- Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000
- John (alternative seller) is offering the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer saves me $200,000 compared to John's offer. Since Alice's price is below my maximum value and lower than the alternative, it makes financial sense to accept her offer.
