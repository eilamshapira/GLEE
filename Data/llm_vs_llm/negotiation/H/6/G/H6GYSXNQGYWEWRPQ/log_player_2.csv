Alice's offer is higher than John's price. It makes sense to negotiate and see if you can get a better deal from Alice before defaulting to John."

``` 

This is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than both Alice's offer and John's price, leaving room for counteroffers but also potentially enticing Alice if she values a quick sale."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

While Alice came down in price, it's still more expensive than John's offer. We can try to negotiate further before resorting to John."

This counteroffer aims to split the difference between her previous offer ($18,000) and our last counteroffer ($10,000). It keeps us below John's price while still demonstrating a willingness to negotiate."

Alice is coming down, but slowly. We're getting close to John's price, so it's time to push a bit more firmly."

We're increasing our offer slightly to show movement, but we're still aiming to stay well below her last offer and closer to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower and we're now only $1000 away from John's guaranteed price. It's time to cut our losses and buy from John to avoid potentially overpaying."
