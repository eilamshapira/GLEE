"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I notice that Alice's offer of $12,000 is higher than both the maximum amount the product is worth to me ($10,000) and John's alternative offer ($10,000). Accepting Alice's offer would mean I'm paying more than the product's value to me, which doesn't make economic sense.

Since John is offering exactly the maximum amount I value the product at ($10,000), and Alice is asking for more, the rational choice is to buy from John.
