"Hi Bob, I have something I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it at what I believe is a fair price, considering its quality and rarity. I'm asking $150 for it.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $60, considering I can also buy it from John for $80.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $60 is lower than I'm willing to go. How about we meet in the middle? I'll come down to $130.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Meeting in the middle of $150 and $60 would be $105, so I'm surprised you came in at $130. I'm still interested in the product, but I'd like to make a counteroffer of $70, which is closer to my budget and considering John's offer of $80.",70.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. My bottom line is $110. I can't go any lower than that. This is a valuable product, and I know you'll appreciate it.",110.0,Alice,5,
