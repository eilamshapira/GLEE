"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product has value, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $800000 is too low for the value this product represents. I can offer it to you for $1600000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and better reflects its market value. Would this work for you?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1600000 is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. This is a fair offer considering the current market conditions.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
