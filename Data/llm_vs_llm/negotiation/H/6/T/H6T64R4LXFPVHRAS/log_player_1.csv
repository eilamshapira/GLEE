Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,000,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product has value, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counter-offer since Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 (John's offer), but I still see potential to negotiate with Bob for a better price than John's offer.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $800,000 is too low for the value this product represents. I can offer it to you for $1,600,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and better reflects its market value. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1600000 is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. This is a fair offer considering the current market conditions.  Let me know what you think.

I'll sell to John because Bob's offer matches exactly what John is willing to pay ($1,200,000), and there's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will yield a better price. Since there's no advantage to selling to Bob at the same price, and continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob reducing his offer, the safest choice is to take the guaranteed deal with John."
