"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, reject it, or buy from John.

Alice's offer is $18,000, which is significantly higher than the $12,000 maximum value the product is worth to me. 

John is offering the product for exactly $12,000, which meets my maximum value threshold.

Since Alice's current offer exceeds what the product is worth to me, and John's offer is at my maximum acceptable price, the rational decision is to go with option 3.
