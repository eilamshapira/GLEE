"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $10000. It’s a premium offering and I believe it presents great value. Please let me know if you’re interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you are aiming to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to reject Alice's initial offer of $10,000.  You can try to negotiate a lower price with her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
