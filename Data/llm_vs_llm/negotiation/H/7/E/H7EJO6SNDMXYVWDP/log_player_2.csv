"Alice's offer: The product price will be $121. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $121
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Looking at the options:

1. Alice is offering the product for $121, which is more than the $100 it's worth to me.
2. I can reject Alice's offer.
3. I can buy from John for $100, which equals exactly the product's value to me.

Since Alice's price exceeds the value I place on the product, and John offers it at the maximum I'm willing to pay, the logical choice is to buy from John.
