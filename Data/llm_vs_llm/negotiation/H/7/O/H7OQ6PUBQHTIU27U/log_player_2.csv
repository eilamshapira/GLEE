"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than my maximum budget of $1,200,000, I am willing to consider it. However, I also believe that Alice's minimum price of $1,000,000 gives me some room to negotiate. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable considering her minimum price. I'll offer $1,050,000, which is halfway between Alice's minimum price and her initial offer.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,075,000 is still higher than I would like to pay, but it's getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with. Since Alice rejected my previous counteroffer, I believe she is willing to negotiate further. I'll reject her offer again and make another counteroffer, trying to meet in the middle.
