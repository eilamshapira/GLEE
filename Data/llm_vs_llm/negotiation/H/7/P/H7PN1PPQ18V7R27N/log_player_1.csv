Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","I'll reject Bob's offer since it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and make a counteroffer. Bob's low offer of $100 suggests we're far apart, but there might still be room for negotiation.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still maintain a price well above my minimum to leave room for negotiation.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer of $110 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and his small increase from $100 to $110 suggests he might not be willing to reach my minimum price. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, and we seem to be making little progress, I'll take the sure deal with John.
