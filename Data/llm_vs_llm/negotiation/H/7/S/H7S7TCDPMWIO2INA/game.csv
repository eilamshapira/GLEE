"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, I've been researching similar products on the market and believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. Given the current market conditions, I'm prepared to offer $12800 for the product.

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're working within budget constraints, my initial offer already represented a considerable discount from the product's true market value. I've reassessed and can offer you the product for $13800, which strikes a better balance between your budget concerns and the premium quality you'll be receiving. This price reflects the exceptional value and unique features this product offers compared to similar items on the market. Would this work for you?",13800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for lowering your offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While $13800 is better, I've been comparing with other options on the market and feel that $13200 would be a fair price that works for both of us. This still provides you with a good profit margin above your costs while meeting my budget requirements. I'm ready to finalize the purchase at this price point and avoid further negotiation time for both of us. What do you say?",13200.0,Bob,4,
