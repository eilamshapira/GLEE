"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well today. I'm excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity to purchase our premium product. Having thoroughly assessed its market value and unique features, I'm offering it to you for $14500. This represents excellent value for a product of this caliber, and I believe it will be a worthwhile investment for you. Would you like to proceed with this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll analyze this situation:

- The product is worth up to $15,000 to me
- Alice's current offer is $14,500
- I can buy from John for $15,000 anytime
- Alice's cost is $12,000, so there's room for negotiation

Alice's initial offer of $14,500 is only $500 less than my maximum valuation and John's price. I should try to negotiate a better deal since there's a $2,500 gap between Alice's cost and her initial offer.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, I've been researching similar products on the market and believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. Given the current market conditions, I'm prepared to offer $12,800 for the product. This represents a fair value that still provides you with a reasonable profit margin while allowing me to stay within my budget constraints. I look forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 12800}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're working within budget constraints, my initial offer already represented a considerable discount from the product's true market value. I've reassessed and can offer you the product for $13800, which strikes a better balance between your budget concerns and the premium quality you'll be receiving. This price reflects the exceptional value and unique features this product offers compared to similar items on the market. Would this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll continue to negotiate since Alice has already reduced her price significantly from $14,500 to $13,800. There's still room for negotiation since her cost is $12,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for lowering your offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While $13,800 is better, I've been comparing with other options on the market and feel that $13,200 would be a fair price that works for both of us. This still provides you with a good profit margin above your costs while meeting my budget requirements. I'm ready to finalize the purchase at this price point and avoid further negotiation time for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13200}"
