"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you the product we discussed. How about we settle on a price of $1300000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to consider all my options carefully:

1. Alice is offering the product for $1,300,000
2. The product is worth at most $1,000,000 to me
3. I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000 guaranteed

Since Alice's offer ($1,300,000) is higher than both the product's value to me and John's price, it makes most sense to buy from John.
