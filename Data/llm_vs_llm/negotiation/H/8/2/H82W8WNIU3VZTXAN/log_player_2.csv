"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice's offer is $200, which is significantly higher than my maximum value, it wouldn't be rational to accept her offer. John is offering the product for $100, which matches my maximum value.
