"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 300}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $40. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $40
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","$40 is far too low, as it's well below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Since I have the guaranteed option to sell to John for $150, I won't accept any offer below that amount. I'll reject Bob's very low offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was very low at $40, I'll significantly lower my initial offer of $300, but still maintain a price well above my minimum of $150 to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 250}"
