"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","The current offer is $95, and my maximum willingness to pay is $100. Buying from John costs $100. I should try to negotiate a lower price, but if I reject this offer, I risk Alice not agreeing to a lower price and potentially losing the deal. Since the offer is below my maximum willingness to pay and less than buying from John, I should accept it.
