Send your offer to Bob.,"I want to make a reasonable offer to Bob that maximizes my profit while being attractive enough that he might accept.

Since I know my product is worth at least $10,000 to me (and I have John as a guaranteed buyer at that price), I'll set my price higher than that threshold. Without knowing Bob's valuation, I'll choose a price that represents a significant but not unreasonable markup.
