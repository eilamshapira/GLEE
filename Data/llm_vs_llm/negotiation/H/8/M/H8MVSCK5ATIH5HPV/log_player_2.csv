Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 4, I offered $750,000, and Alice rejected it. Now, she's come back with an offer of $900,000. To try to meet in the middle, I'll increase my offer again, but I'll also keep in mind that I don't want to go too far above my maximum budget of $800,000. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to see if Alice will meet me closer to my target price.
