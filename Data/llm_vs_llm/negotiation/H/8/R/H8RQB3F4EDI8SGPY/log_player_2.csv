"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. Given how much you value this product, I'm offering it to you for $8000. I believe it's a fair price, reflecting its true worth to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since the product is worth $8,000 to me and Alice is offering it for $8,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay, I don't see any benefit in rejecting the offer or buying from John for the same price.
