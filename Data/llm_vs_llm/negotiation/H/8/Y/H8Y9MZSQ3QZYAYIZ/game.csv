"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is more than the product is worth to me. I can get the same product from John for $15000. But I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. I'm willing to offer $12000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response and for the offer. I appreciate you being upfront about your budget. While $12000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to find a middle ground. How about we settle on $16000?  This price reflects the true value of the product while offering you a significant discount compared to your alternative option.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16000 is still more than I can justify spending, especially since I can purchase the same product from John for $15000. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer $13500, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale today.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I respect that. Let's make this simple: I'm willing to come down to $14500. This is my final offer, as it's a significant reduction and a fair price considering the value this product offers. What do you say?",14500.0,Alice,5,
