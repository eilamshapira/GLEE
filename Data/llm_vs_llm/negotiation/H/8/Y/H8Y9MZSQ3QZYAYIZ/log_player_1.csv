Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is more than the product is worth to me. I can get the same product from John for $15000. But I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. I'm willing to offer $12000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

While $12,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to find a middle ground. How about we settle on $16,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product while offering you a significant discount compared to your alternative option."", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16000 is still more than I can justify spending, especially since I can purchase the same product from John for $15000. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer $13500, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500.
