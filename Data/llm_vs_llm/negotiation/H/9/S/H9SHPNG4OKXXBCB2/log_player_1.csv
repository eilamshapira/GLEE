Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 120} 

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This strategy allows for:

* **Potential for higher profit:** If Bob values the product highly, he might accept this initial high price. 
* **Room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's space to negotiate downwards and potentially still get a better price than John's offer."
