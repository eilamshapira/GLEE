"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Based on the information provided, I need to decide between Alice's offer and buying from John.

Alice's offer: $1,200,000
John's offer: $1,200,000
My maximum value for the product: $1,200,000

Both Alice and John are offering the product at exactly my maximum valuation of $1,200,000. Since both offers are identical in price, and my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, I have no financial advantage in choosing one over the other.

Given there's no price difference, I'll accept Alice's offer since she's the primary seller in this interaction.
