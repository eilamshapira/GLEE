"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. The product sounds interesting, but $150 is more than I was planning to spend. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $120, but I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider $100 for the product?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, Bob! While $100 is lower than I can go, I'd be happy to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $125 for the product? Let me know!",125.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. However, I can purchase this same product from another seller for $120, so I can't justify paying more than that. To make it worth buying from you instead, I'd like to offer you $110 for the product. This gives us both a good deal - I save a bit compared to my other option, and you make a sale. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,4,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your position. I understand you're looking to save a bit, but $110 is still lower than I can accept. How about we agree on $120 for the product? I think that strikes a fair balance for both of us. Let me know!",120.0,Alice,5,
