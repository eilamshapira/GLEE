Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'm offering a price of $1.2 million because:
1. I know my minimum acceptable price is $800,000
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $800,000
3. Setting a higher initial price gives room for potential negotiation while still maintaining a good profit margin
4. If Bob's valuation of the product is high, this price could be acceptable to him"
