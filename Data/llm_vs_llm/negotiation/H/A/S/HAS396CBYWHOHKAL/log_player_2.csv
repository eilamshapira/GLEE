"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $1,000,000, I should not pay Alice's price of $1,200,000 which exceeds my maximum valuation. Alice's current offer ($1,200,000) is higher than John's guaranteed price ($1,000,000), so the rational choice is to buy from John.
