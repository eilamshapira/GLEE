"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1499999. I believe this price properly reflects the exceptional value and quality of the product. I look forward to hearing a positive response from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,499,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,499,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I notice that Alice is offering the product for $1,499,999, which is just $1 less than what John is offering ($1,500,000). 

While technically Alice's offer saves me $1, this is an extremely small savings compared to the total amount. Alice is clearly trying to offer just barely below my maximum willingness to pay, knowing I have an alternative at $1,500,000.

Since the product is worth only $800,000 to Alice, there should be room for a much better deal that would benefit both of us. Alice's current offer is trying to capture almost all of the potential surplus from this transaction.

I'll reject this offer to signal that I expect a more reasonable price.
