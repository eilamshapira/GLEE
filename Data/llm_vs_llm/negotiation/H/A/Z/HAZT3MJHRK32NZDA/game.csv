"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $115 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $90 as it's below my cost basis. However, I can reduce my initial offer to $110. This is still a good value considering the product's worth, and it represents a meaningful discount from my first offer.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for reducing your price to $110. I appreciate the discount, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $95. I believe this is a reasonable compromise between our two positions, and I'm willing to meet you closer to your target price.",95.0,Bob,4,
