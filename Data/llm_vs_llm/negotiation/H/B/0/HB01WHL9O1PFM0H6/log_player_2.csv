I'm still going to reject Alice's offer. $160 is still too much for me.  I'll try one more counteroffer before buying from John."

Alice is getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with her offer. I'm going to buy the product from John.  It's more than I wanted to pay, but it's still within my budget."
