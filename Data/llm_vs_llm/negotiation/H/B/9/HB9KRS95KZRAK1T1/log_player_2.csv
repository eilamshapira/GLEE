"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll evaluate this offer from Alice.

- Alice is offering the product for $1,100,000
- The product is worth up to $1,200,000 to me
- John offers the same product for $1,200,000
- Alice's cost is $800,000, so she has room to negotiate

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is already $100,000 better than John's price, but there's likely room to negotiate for an even better price since Alice has a $300,000 margin between her cost and her offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that acknowledges Alice's need for profit while trying to get a better price for myself.

{""product_price"": $900,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I see that Alice has lowered her offer from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is already $150,000 better than John's price, but I think there's still room for negotiation since Alice's cost is $800,000.

While Alice rejected my previous offer of $900,000 (which would have given her $100,000 profit), she might be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer to show willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good price.

{""product_price"": $950,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has now reduced her price to $1,000,000, which is $200,000 better than John's price. This represents good progress in our negotiation.

Looking at the situation:
- Alice's cost: $800,000
- Alice's current offer: $1,000,000 (giving her a $200,000 profit)
- My last offer: $950,000
- John's fixed price: $1,200,000

Alice has come down $100,000 from her initial offer, and we're getting closer. $1,000,000 is a reasonable price that gives Alice a good profit while saving me a significant amount compared to John's price.
