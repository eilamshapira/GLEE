"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $250. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Looking at Alice's offer of $250, I need to consider my options carefully. The product is only worth up to $80 to me, so Alice's price of $250 is far above my maximum value. I could try to negotiate with Alice by rejecting this offer, but I already know I can get the exact same product from John for $80, which is my maximum value threshold.

Given that John's price matches my maximum value, and Alice's initial offer is more than three times that amount, the most rational decision is to:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
