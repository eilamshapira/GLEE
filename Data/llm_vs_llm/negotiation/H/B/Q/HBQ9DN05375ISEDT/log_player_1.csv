"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I know the product is worth at least $10,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer as a backup, I'll start with a high initial offer to test Bob's willingness to pay.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the same as John's guaranteed offer ($10,000), and it's only round 2, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I still have 8 more rounds to potentially get a better deal, and worst case, I can always sell to John for $10,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still maintain a high price to leave room for negotiation, aiming to get more than the $10,000 guaranteed from John.

{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob has increased his offer to $11,000, which is $1,000 more than John's guaranteed offer, I will accept this offer. It's a better deal than John's offer, and there's no guarantee that Bob will increase his price further if we continue negotiating.
