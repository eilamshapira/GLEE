"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $1500000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me, which is what another seller (John) is currently offering. I'd like to propose $650000 for your product. This would allow you to make a sale today while giving me some savings compared to my alternative option.",650000.0,Bob,2,
