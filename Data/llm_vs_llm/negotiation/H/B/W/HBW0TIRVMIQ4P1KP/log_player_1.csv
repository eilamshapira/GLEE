"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you my product, which I believe you will find valuable. I can sell it to you for $1,500,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $1500000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me, which is what another seller (John) is currently offering. I'd like to propose $650000 for your product. This would allow you to make a sale today while giving me some savings compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
