"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you my product, which I believe you will find valuable. I can sell it to you for $1500000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Based on the given information, Alice is offering the product at $1,500,000, which is significantly above both my maximum value of $800,000 and even above Alice's own valuation of $1,200,000. This price is not reasonable for me.

Since John is offering the product at exactly $800,000 (which is my maximum valuation), I could buy from him. However, I should first try to negotiate with Alice to potentially get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, which is what another seller (John) is currently offering. I'd like to propose $650,000 for your product. This would allow you to make a sale today while giving me some savings compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
