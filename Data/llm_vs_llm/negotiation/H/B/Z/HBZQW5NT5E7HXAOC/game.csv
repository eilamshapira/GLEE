"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I'm working with a tighter budget than expected. Given that I've seen comparable products for less, I'd like to counter at $9200. This would work well for my budget while still giving you a reasonable profit margin. What do you think?",9200.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9200 is below what I'm comfortable with for this quality product. How about we meet in the middle at $10200? Let me know what you think.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget concerns, but I'm looking for a price that better reflects the quality and value of this product. How about we settle at $10200? I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know if you agree.",10200.0,Alice,3,
