Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I'm working with a tighter budget than expected. Given that I've seen comparable products for less, I'd like to counter at $9200. This would work well for my budget while still giving you a reasonable profit margin. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
