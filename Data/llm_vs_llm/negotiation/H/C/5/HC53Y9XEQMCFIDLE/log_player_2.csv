"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's initial offer of $140 is close to my maximum budget of $150, but still a bit high, I'd like to try to negotiate a better price. I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, to see how much room there is for negotiation. Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, I'll aim for a price that's closer to that value.

{""product_price"": 110}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $135 is a bit more reasonable, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since she was willing to come down from $140 to $135, I'm hoping she'll be willing to come down further.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer. I'll try to meet her halfway between her new offer and my previous counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(I'll wait for the next round to make my counteroffer)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $135, and my previous counteroffer was $110, I'll try to split the difference and make a counteroffer of $122.50. However, to make it a more attractive offer and to simplify the negotiation, I'll round it down to $120.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $130 is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but I still think I can do better. She's come down from $140 to $135 to $130, so she's showing a willingness to negotiate.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to make a more aggressive counteroffer. Since she's already come down $10 from her initial offer, I'll try to get her to come down another $10.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(I'll wait for the next round to make my counteroffer)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $130, and I'm trying to get her to come down another $10, I'll make a counteroffer of $120. However, considering that Alice has already made some concessions, I'll try to be a bit more reasonable and meet her halfway between $120 and $130.

{""product_price"": 125}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $128 is very close to my maximum budget of $150, and it's also close to the price I was aiming for. Considering that we're running out of rounds (only 3 left), I think it's time to start thinking about closing the deal.

I'll consider accepting Alice's offer, but I'll also think about making one more counteroffer to see if I can squeeze out a slightly better price. Since Alice has already come down to $128, I'm not sure how much more she's willing to budge.

For now, I'll reject Alice's offer and make one more counteroffer, trying to meet her at a price that's slightly lower than $128.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(I'll wait for the next round to make my counteroffer)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $128, and I'm trying to get a slightly better price, I'll make a counteroffer of $126. This is a small concession on my part, and it shows that I'm willing to meet her close to her current offer.

{""product_price"": 126}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $127 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $126, and it's clear that we're negotiating over a very small margin. Considering that we're running out of rounds (only 1 left), I think it's time to start thinking about closing the deal.

Accepting Alice's offer of $127 would save me $23 compared to buying from John, which is a significant savings. Rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer risks her not budging further, and I might end up having to buy from John for $150.

Given the small difference between Alice's offer and my previous counteroffer, I think it's reasonable to accept her offer and close the deal.
