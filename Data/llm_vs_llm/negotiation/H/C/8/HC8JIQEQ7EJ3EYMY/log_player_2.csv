"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an exceptional product available. I'm offering it to you for $15000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $15,000 is way above my maximum value of $8,000. Since I can buy the same product from John for $8,000, I wouldn't accept any price higher than that. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is significantly above my budget. I actually have another option to purchase this product for $8,000 from another seller. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable price. Would you consider accepting $6,500 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 6500}"
