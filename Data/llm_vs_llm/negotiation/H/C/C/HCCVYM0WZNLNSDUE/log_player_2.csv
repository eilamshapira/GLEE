"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is only worth $80 to me and I can buy it from John for $80, I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice that's below my maximum value but still gives her some profit compared to her $150 cost.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price is still well above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). There's no reason to accept this offer when I can either try to negotiate further or buy from John for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has moved down from $170 to $140, showing some flexibility, I'll increase my previous offer slightly but still keep it well below my maximum value of $80.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's price ($130) is still significantly higher than John's price ($80) and above my maximum value ($80), it's best to buy from John. Alice seems unlikely to drop her price below $80 given her previous offers, and since that's my maximum value and John's price, there's no reason to continue negotiating."
