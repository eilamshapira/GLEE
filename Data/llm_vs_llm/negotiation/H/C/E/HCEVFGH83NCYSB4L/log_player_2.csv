"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product at a special price of $15000. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $15,000
2. John is willing to sell it for $15,000
3. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($15,000), and this is exactly my maximum valuation, I'm indifferent between buying from either of them. However, since Alice has already made the offer and we're already in communication, it makes more sense to accept her offer rather than going through the process of finding John.
