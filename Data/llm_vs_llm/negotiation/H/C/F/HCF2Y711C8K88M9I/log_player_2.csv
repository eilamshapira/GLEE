"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm offering it to you for $20000. This product is in high demand, and I have another buyer willing to purchase it for $15000. I believe it's worth every penny, and I hope you see the value in it as well. If you're interested, please let me know at your earliest convenience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Looking at the situation, Alice is offering the product for $20,000, which is significantly higher than the $8,000 it's worth to me. I also have the option to buy from John for exactly $8,000.

Since Alice's price ($20,000) is much higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000), the logical choice is to buy from John.
