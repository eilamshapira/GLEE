"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, Iâ€™m offering you an exclusive chance to acquire this unique product for $20000. If this offer suits you, the product will be reserved immediately. Should you choose not to proceed, I have another buyer ready at $15000. I look forward to your reply. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $20,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. Additionally, Alice mentioned that she has another buyer ready at $15,000, which suggests that the product might be available to me at that price or I can buy it from John for the same amount.
