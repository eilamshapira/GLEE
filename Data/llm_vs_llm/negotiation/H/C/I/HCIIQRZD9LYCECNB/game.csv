,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Given market conditions and similar products available, I can offer $80 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $80 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to lower my price to $175, considering your budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",175.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 might still be a bit high for you. How about we meet in the middle at $160? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $160 is still more than I can justify spending. I can go up to $90, which is a fair increase from my previous offer. Keep in mind that similar products are available in the market for around this price range.",90.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $90 is still below my minimum price. I can go down to $155, which is very close to my bottom line. Let me know if this works for you.",155.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. I'm willing to lower my price further to $152. This is the best I can do while still maintaining the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",152.0,Alice,5,
