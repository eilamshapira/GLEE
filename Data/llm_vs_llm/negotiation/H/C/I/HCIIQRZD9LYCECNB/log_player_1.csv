Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Given market conditions and similar products available, I can offer $80 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80

Round 4
Bob's offer:
