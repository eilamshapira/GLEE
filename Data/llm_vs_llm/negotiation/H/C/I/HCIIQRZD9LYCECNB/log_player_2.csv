"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
2. John is offering the same product for $100
3. Alice's offer of $200 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price

The logical decision is to reject Alice's offer. I can either try to negotiate with Alice for a better price or buy from John if the negotiations don't go well.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my target price but still leaves some room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Given market conditions and similar products available, I can offer $80 for the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $175 might still be a bit high for you. How about we meet in the middle at $160? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since:
1. Alice's new offer of $160 is still significantly higher than my maximum value ($100)
2. It's also higher than John's fixed price ($100)
3. We still have several rounds for negotiation, but if Alice won't come down enough, I can always buy from John

The rational choice is to reject this offer and continue negotiating, as there's no reason to pay $160 when I have a guaranteed option at $100.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer, slightly increasing my previous offer but still keeping it within my acceptable range.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $160 is still more than I can justify spending. I can go up to $90, which is a fair increase from my previous offer. Keep in mind that similar products are available in the market for around this price range."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. I'm willing to lower my price further to $152. This is the best I can do while still maintaining the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you can work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that:
1. Alice's new offer ($152) is still well above my maximum value ($100)
2. It's also still higher than John's guaranteed price ($100)
3. Alice seems to be making only small concessions
4. We're now halfway through our negotiation rounds
5. I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $100

At this point, it's clear that Alice is unlikely to come down to a price below John's offer of $100. Since I can get the same product from John for $100, which is already my maximum value for the product, it makes the most sense to end the negotiation with Alice and take John's offer.
