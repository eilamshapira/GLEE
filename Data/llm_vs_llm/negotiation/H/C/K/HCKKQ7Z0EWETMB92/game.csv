"Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2500000.

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2500000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. Given my research and understanding of the product's market value, I'd be willing to offer $1200000 for it. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while also being a fair and reasonable price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, given the product's exceptional quality and market position, I cannot accept $1200000. I'm willing to adjust my initial price and offer the product for $2000000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while better reflecting the product's true value.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2000000 remains too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1500000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering my budget and the product's value. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
