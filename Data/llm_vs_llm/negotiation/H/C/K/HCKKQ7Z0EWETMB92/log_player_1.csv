"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,500,000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential value. Would you be interested in making this investment?"", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2500000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. Given my research and understanding of the product's market value, I'd be willing to offer $1200000 for it. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while also being a fair and reasonable price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll continue negotiating as $1,200,000 is closer to my target, but I believe we can reach a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, given the product's exceptional quality and market position, I cannot accept $1,200,000. I'm willing to adjust my initial price and offer the product for $2,000,000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while better reflecting the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2000000 remains too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1500000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering my budget and the product's value. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,500,000. This is a reasonable compromise that provides a good profit margin above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and there's always the risk that continuing to negotiate might lead to a less favorable outcome or Bob walking away from the deal entirely."
