"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2500000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential value. Would you be interested in making this investment? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. Given my research and understanding of the product's market value, I'd be willing to offer $1,200,000 for it. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while also being a fair and reasonable price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, given the product's exceptional quality and market position, I cannot accept $1200000. I'm willing to adjust my initial price and offer the product for $2000000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while better reflecting the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is still asking too much. I'm willing to negotiate further, but $2,000,000 is still outside of my acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,000,000 remains too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering my budget and the product's value. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
