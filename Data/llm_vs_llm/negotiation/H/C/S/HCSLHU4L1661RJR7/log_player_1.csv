Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what price to offer Bob. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and if he rejects my offer, I'm guaranteed $800,000 from John.

I want to maximize my earnings while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Since Bob knows I have another buyer at $800,000, he would understand that I won't accept less than that amount. However, I also need to offer him some value compared to the product's worth to him.

A reasonable approach would be to offer the product at a price that gives Bob some of the surplus value while maximizing my earnings. I'll propose a price of $950,000, which gives Bob $50,000 in value (5% of the product's worth to him) while giving me $150,000 more than my alternative option.
