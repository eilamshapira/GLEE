"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, reject it, or buy from John.

Alice is offering the product for $950,000, while John is selling it for $1,000,000.

The product is worth up to $1,000,000 to me, so both options would be acceptable. However, Alice's offer is $50,000 cheaper than John's price.

My goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, so I should accept Alice's offer of $950,000.
