Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what price to offer to Bob for the product. The product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price if Bob declines.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I should offer a price that's higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I want to maximize my profit while still giving Bob a reasonable offer that he might accept.
