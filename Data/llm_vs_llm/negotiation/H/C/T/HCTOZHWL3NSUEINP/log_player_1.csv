Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider the value of the product to both Bob and myself. The product is worth $12,000 to Bob and at least $8,000 to me. I know I can always sell it to John for $8,000, so that's my BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement).

I should start with a price that's reasonably high but not so high that Bob immediately rejects it. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, I could offer him a price that allows him to capture some of that value while still giving me a good profit above my $8,000 minimum.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll adjust my counteroffer to be more attractive to Bob while still trying to maximize my profit. Since Bob offered $9,000 and my minimum is $8,000 with John as a backup, I'll come down from my initial offer but still aim for a good margin.
