"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 seems a bit high for this product. Given the current market conditions, I would be willing to pay $130 for it. This would still give you a reasonable profit margin while being a fair price for me. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $130. I understand that you think $150 is a bit high, but I still believe the product is worth more than $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $140. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that you're willing to pay up to $150. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $140. You're making a fair point, but I think we can find a price that works even better for both of us. I can offer $135 - this is a good middle ground that gives you a solid profit margin while providing me with some savings. Would this work for you?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $135. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. After considering your offer, I'm willing to make a small concession. I can sell the product to you for $137.50, which is a compromise between your offer and my previous counteroffer. This price reflects the product's value and takes into account your budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",137.5,Alice,5,
