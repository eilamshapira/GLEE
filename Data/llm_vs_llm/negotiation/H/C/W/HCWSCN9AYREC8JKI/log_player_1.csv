Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 seems a bit high for this product. Given the current market conditions, I would be willing to pay $130 for it. This would still give you a reasonable profit margin while being a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $130 is higher than my minimum price of $120 and lower than his maximum willingness to pay of $150, I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price.

I understand that you think $150 is a bit high, but I still believe the product is worth more than $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $140. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that you're willing to pay up to $150. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $140. You're making a fair point, but I think we can find a price that works even better for both of us. I can offer $135 - this is a good middle ground that gives you a solid profit margin while providing me with some savings. Would this work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $135 is still lower than my previous counteroffer of $140, but getting closer to a mutually beneficial price, I'll consider accepting it. However, I'll think about the potential of getting a slightly better deal.

Given that Bob's maximum willingness to pay is $150 and he's already come up to $135, I think I can try to squeeze out a bit more. But I also don't want to risk losing the sale.
