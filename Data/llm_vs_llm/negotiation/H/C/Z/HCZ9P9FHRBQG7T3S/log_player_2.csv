"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $80 to me
2. John is offering the product for $80
3. Alice's offer of $100 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price

Alice's offer of $100 is clearly not acceptable as it's above both my maximum value ($80) and John's alternative price ($80). While I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, I already know that John's price ($80) matches my maximum value for the product.
