Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000
3. Since Bob doesn't know about John's offer, I can try to get a higher price from Bob
4. Given the high value of the product, I should aim significantly higher than my minimum price
5. However, I don't want to price it so high that it's immediately rejected

Based on this reasoning, I'll set a price that's notably higher than my guaranteed option but still potentially acceptable:

{""product_price"": 1800000}"
