"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Based on the information provided, I'll evaluate my options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $1,800,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: $800,000

Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $800,000, Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation and my alternative option. The rational choice is to buy from John and save $1,000,000.
