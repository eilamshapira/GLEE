"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000}

I'll start with a relatively high offer of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down while still maintaining a good profit margin above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000, he might counter with a lower offer, but I have the security of John's $10,000 offer as a backup."
