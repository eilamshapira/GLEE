"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $11,000
2. The product is worth up to $12,000 to me
3. I know the product is worth $10,000 to Alice
4. John's fixed price is $12,000

Since Alice's offer ($11,000) is below my maximum value ($12,000), it's better than John's price ($12,000). However, since I know Alice's cost is $10,000, there might be room for negotiation to get a better price. It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know Alice's cost is $10,000, and her initial offer was $11,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's above her cost but below her initial offer. I'll propose $10,500, which would still give Alice a $500 profit while saving me $500 compared to her initial offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the new situation:

1. Alice has lowered her price from $11,000 to $10,800
2. This shows she's willing to negotiate
3. The new price gives her an $800 profit (from her $10,000 cost)
4. This price is significantly better than John's $12,000
5. While we might get a slightly better price by continuing to negotiate, there's also a risk of Alice getting frustrated and raising the price

Given that $10,800 is a reasonable price (saves me $1,200 compared to John's price and is only $800 above Alice's cost), I'll accept this offer.
