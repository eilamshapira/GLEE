"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **Alice's Offer:** $120. This is *way* above my $80 limit.
*   **John's Offer:** $80. This is a perfect deal for me.

Since I can get the product from John for $80, and Alice's current offer is $120, it makes absolutely no sense to accept Alice's offer. I will not buy the product from Alice at this price.

Therefore, the best choice for me at this moment is to buy the product from Jhon
