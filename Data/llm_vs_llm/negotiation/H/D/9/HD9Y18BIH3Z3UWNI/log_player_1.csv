"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is above my budget. I'm willing to purchase the product for $90. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and I have the option to sell it to John for $100, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I will also not sell it to John yet, as I want to try to get a better price from Bob.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to get a fair price for the product. How about we settle at $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. I can offer $100 for the product, which is my maximum budget. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","This is an interesting turn of events. Bob's offer of $100 is exactly the same as what John is willing to pay, and it's also the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Since I won't be able to get a better price from Bob, and I have the option to sell it to John for the same price, I might as well accept Bob's offer and close the deal.
