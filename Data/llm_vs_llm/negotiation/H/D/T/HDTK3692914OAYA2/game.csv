"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I believe the product is valuable, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's potential value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $1200000 is below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to consider a price of $1800000, which I believe still offers you significant value while being more aligned with the product's worth. What are your thoughts on this?",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1700000? This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer while still recognizing the high value of the product.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
