Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I believe the product is valuable, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's potential value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $1,200,000 is below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,800,000, which I believe still offers you significant value while being more aligned with the product's worth. What are your thoughts on this?""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,700,000? This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer while still recognizing the high value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
