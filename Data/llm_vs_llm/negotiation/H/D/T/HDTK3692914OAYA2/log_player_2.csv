Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still shows that I'm interested in the product.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I believe the product is valuable, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's potential value to me."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
