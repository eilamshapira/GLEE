Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being open to negotiation.  I'm interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $700000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $700,000 is lower than what John is willing to pay ($800,000), and it's also lower than the minimum value of the product to me ($800,000), I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better price.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.
