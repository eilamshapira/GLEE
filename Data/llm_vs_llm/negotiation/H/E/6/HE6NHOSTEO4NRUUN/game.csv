"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1800000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion. Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand that the product has exceptional value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Let me know if we can discuss this further.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your perspective, $500000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To move forward, I could consider a price of $1500000. This reflects the product's unique qualities while acknowledging your interest.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to consider a lower price. However, $1500000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $750000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that. However, the gap between our positions remains substantial. I'm willing to make a further concession, but I need you to meet me closer to the product's real value. Would you consider $1300000?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1300000 is still out of my reach. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, but I need you to consider a more reasonable price. I'd like to propose a price of $900000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. If we can't agree on this, I may need to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome. However, $900000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1100000. This is a substantial compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and make a substantial concession. I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you close to your final offer. However, I can only stretch my budget to $1000000. I'd like to propose this price as a final offer from my side. If we can agree on this, I'm ready to close the deal immediately.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
