# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that. However, the gap between our positions remains substantial. I'm willing to make a further concession, but I need you to meet me closer to the product's real value. Would you consider $1300000?

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome. However, $900000 undervalues the product significantly.
