"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $12000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than my maximum budget of $15,000, it's a good deal for me. I don't need to consider buying from John at this point.
