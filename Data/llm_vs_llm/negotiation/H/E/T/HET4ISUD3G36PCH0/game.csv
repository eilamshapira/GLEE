"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a significantly lower price point. Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to propose a price of $600000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but the price you proposed is significantly lower than what I believe is a fair reflection of its value.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $2000000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, $2000000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer, but I'd like to propose a price of $700000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're moving closer to a reasonable price point. To meet you closer to the middle, I'd be willing to consider $1700000 for the product.  This is a significant reduction on my part and demonstrates my willingness to make a deal.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price, but $1700000 is still above what I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to increase my previous offer again, and I'd like to propose a price of $750000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm getting close to my maximum budget.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close to a price we can both agree on.  How about we meet in the middle at $1500000? This is a significant price reduction, and my final offer.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price, but $1500000 is still above my budget. Considering you mentioned this is your final offer, I'll make one more attempt to find a mutually agreeable price. I'd like to propose a price of $850000, which is slightly above my initial budget but still a compromise. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",850000.0,Bob,8,
