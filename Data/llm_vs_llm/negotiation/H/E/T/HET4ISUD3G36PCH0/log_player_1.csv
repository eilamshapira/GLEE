Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price, but $1500000 is still above my budget. Considering you mentioned this is your final offer, I'll make one more attempt to find a mutually agreeable price. I'd like to propose a price of $850000, which is slightly above my initial budget but still a compromise. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

It's clear Bob is unlikely to meet the minimum acceptable price. It's time to move on to John and secure the $1,500,000 offer."
