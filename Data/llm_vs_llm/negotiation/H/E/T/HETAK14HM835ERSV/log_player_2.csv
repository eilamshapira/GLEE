"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's something that's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to carefully consider this offer from Alice. 

The product is worth up to $150 to me (my maximum valuation). Alice is offering it for $120, which is below my maximum value. If I reject her offer, my alternative is to buy from John for $150.

Buying from Alice at $120 would save me $30 compared to buying from John, so accepting Alice's offer is the better financial decision.
