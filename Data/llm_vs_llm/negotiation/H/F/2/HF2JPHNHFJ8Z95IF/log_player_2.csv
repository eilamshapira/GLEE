"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","The product is worth $1,000,000 to me. Alice offers the product for $950,000. I could buy it from John for $1,000,000. Buying from Alice at $950,000 is the better option than buying from John. I should also consider if I can negotiate a better price with Alice. Since I have not made any offer before, it's better to try negotiating with Alice for a lower price first.

Therefore, I will reject the offer and make a counteroffer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'm getting closer to a good price. Alice's current offer is $900,000. Buying from John costs $1,000,000. The product is worth $1,000,000 to me. I am at least saving $100,000 if I buy from Alice. I think it would be great if I could get a better price, but I am not sure how much further Alice will reduce the price. Considering the product's value to me, I think $900,000 is a reasonable price to pay. Therefore, I will accept Alice's offer.
