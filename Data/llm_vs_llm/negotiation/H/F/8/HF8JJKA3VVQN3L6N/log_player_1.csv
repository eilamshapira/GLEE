(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my desired minimum of $10,000. However, it's getting close. I could reject and counter, but the price is getting close to the $10,000 I'm guaranteed from John. Given the risk of Bob offering even less, I will reject Bob's offer and instead sell to John.
