"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I understand your position, but the product's value is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1550000 as a final offer. This is a very competitive price considering the product's worth. Please let me know if you can meet this price.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $1550000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $750000, which is the highest I'm comfortable paying. If this is not acceptable, I may need to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I see that we're still far apart on the price. I'm willing to make a significant compromise and offer the product at $1525000. This is the lowest I can go while still valuing the product appropriately. Please consider this offer carefully, as it's my final attempt to meet in the middle.",1525000.0,Alice,5,
