"Thanks Alice, but I think $9500 is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking of getting it from John for $10000. How about I offer you $7500 instead?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8500,  which is a fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $8500 is still a bit high for me. I am going to buy from Jhon, for $10000, but I am still interested in your product. How about I offer you $8000 instead?",8000.0,Bob,4,
