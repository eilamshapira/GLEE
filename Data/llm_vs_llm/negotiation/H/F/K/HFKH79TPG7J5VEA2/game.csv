"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $25000. What are your thoughts?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is significantly above my budget and the market value I'm looking at. Given my research and budget constraints, I would be willing to pay $10000 for the product. This is a fair offer considering similar products in the market.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, however, $10000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $20000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $20000 is still well above what I can justify spending. I should mention that I have another offer from a different seller at $12000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I can offer $11000, which is quite close to my maximum budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for being upfront about your budget and the competing offer.  I value your business and am motivated to find a solution. How about we meet in the middle at $16000? This reflects my bottom line while hopefully addressing your budget constraints.",16000.0,Alice,5,
