Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is significantly above my budget and the market value I'm looking at. Given my research and budget constraints, I would be willing to pay $10000 for the product. This is a fair offer considering similar products in the market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I can offer $11000, which is quite close to my maximum budget.
