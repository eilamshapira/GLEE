"Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $5000, considering the market value and my own financial constraints. I'm looking forward to your response.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but $5000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'd like to offer the product to you for $15000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value and the market demand.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7000, which is closer to my budget and takes into account the product's value. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid to $7000. However, I still need to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $12000. I'd like to offer the product to you for $12000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. If you're interested in the product, I hope you can meet me at this price.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I understand that $12000 is a significant reduction from your initial offer, but it's still above my budget. Considering I have another option to buy the product from John for $8000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8500. This is the highest price I'm comfortable paying, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",8500.0,Bob,6,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you have another option to buy the product from John for $8000, but I believe my product is worth more. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to get at least $10500 for it. I'd like to offer the product to you for $10500, which is a significant reduction from my previous offers. If you're interested in the product, I hope you can meet me at this price. Please note that I also have another buyer interested in the product, and I may need to consider their offer if we can't reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,7,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for being transparent about the other buyer's interest. I understand that you need to get a good price for the product, but $10500 is still above my budget. Considering I have a firm alternative to buy the product from John for $8000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John.",9000.0,Bob,8,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid to $9000. However, I'm still looking for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value. Considering I have a firm offer from John for $10000, I'd like to offer the product to you for $10200. This is my final concession, and I hope you can meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to consider selling to John, as their offer is becoming more attractive.",10200.0,Alice,9,
