Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $5000, considering the market value and my own financial constraints. I'm looking forward to your response.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15000 is still a bit steep for me.

I reject Bob's offer of $8500 because it's still below the price I'm willing to accept. Although Bob has increased his offer significantly, I believe the product is worth more. I'm also aware that Bob has another option to buy the product from John for $8000, but I'm not willing to sell it to him for $8500.
