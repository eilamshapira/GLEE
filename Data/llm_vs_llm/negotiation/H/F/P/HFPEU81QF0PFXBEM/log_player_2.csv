"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's initial offer is $150, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and I also have the option to buy it from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in accepting Alice's offer immediately without trying to negotiate a better price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in hopes of getting a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable considering the product's value to me and the alternative of buying from John. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a somewhat lower offer to see how Alice responds.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has made a counteroffer of $140, which is $10 lower than her initial offer and $10 lower than what I can get from John. This indicates she's willing to negotiate, but still wants to get a relatively high price for the product.

Given that Alice's offer is now closer to what I'm willing to pay and considering I want to save as much money as possible, I'll think about my next move. Since $140 is still a bit higher than I'd ideally like to pay, and knowing that Alice's bottom line is $100, I'll try to negotiate further.

I'll make another counteroffer, trying to meet somewhere in the middle between Alice's last offer and my previous counteroffer, aiming to save more money.
