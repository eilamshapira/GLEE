"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $17,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $12,000, and also higher than John's price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 11000}

I'll offer $11,000, which is below John's price of $12,000. This gives room for negotiation while still being a reasonable price that could potentially lead to a deal that's beneficial for both parties. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Alice, while my maximum is $12,000, we need to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $16,500 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000). The reduction from $17,000 to $16,500 is too small to be meaningful in this negotiation. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, but if Alice continues to make only minimal reductions, I may need to consider buying from John instead."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 11500}

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $11,500 to show willingness to negotiate, while still staying below John's price of $12,000. This price would allow Alice to make some profit (as it costs her $15,000), while giving me a better deal than John's offer. However, if Alice continues to make only small concessions and stays well above $12,000, I will likely end up buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'm choosing to buy from John because:
1. Alice's offers are still far above my maximum value of $12,000
2. The pace of Alice's price reductions ($17,000 → $16,500 → $16,000) suggests she's unlikely to reach $12,000 within the remaining rounds
3. John's price of $12,000 is exactly at my maximum value
4. We've already spent 5 rounds negotiating with little progress
5. There's no guarantee Alice will ever go below $12,000 since the product is worth $15,000 to her

It's more rational to take John's guaranteed offer now rather than continue this unproductive negotiation."
