"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I understand the value you see in the product, my budget is quite limited. I'm willing to offer $500000 for it. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your offer. While $500000 is lower than I can accept, I appreciate you engaging in the negotiation. Considering your budget constraints, how about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $2200000. This is a significant reduction from my initial asking price and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",2200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While $600000 is still quite a bit lower than my bottom line, I'm willing to move further. I can offer you the product for $2000000. This is as low as I can realistically go while still making it worthwhile for me. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,5,
