Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, but I'm afraid $5000000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, considering the product's worth. I'd like to propose a price that I believe is reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $750,000 is lower than my initial offer and I believe the product is worth more. I'll try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. 

My counteroffer: $3,000,000"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate the compromise, but $3000000 is still above my budget.

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as $900,000 is still lower than I'm comfortable with, but it's getting closer to a price that I might consider acceptable. Since Bob is willing to increase his offer, I'll try to meet him halfway.
