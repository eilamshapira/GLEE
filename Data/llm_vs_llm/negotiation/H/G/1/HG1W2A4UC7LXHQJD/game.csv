"Hi Alice! Thank you for the offer, but $20000 is beyond my budget. I can offer you $8000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest, but $8000 is too low for me. How about I lower my price slightly to $18000? Let me know if that works for you.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice! I understand your position, but $18000 is still more than I can afford. I can offer $9000, which is within my budget. I hope we can make this deal happen.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob! However, $9000 is still too low for the value of the product. How about I meet you in the middle at $17000? Let me know if this works for you.",17000.0,Alice,5,
