Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2400000}

I'm offering a price of $2.4 million. This is double my minimum acceptable price of $1.2 million. Since I don't know Bob's maximum value for the product, setting the price at this level gives me the opportunity to capture more value if Bob values the product highly, while still having John's guaranteed offer as a backup if Bob rejects it."
