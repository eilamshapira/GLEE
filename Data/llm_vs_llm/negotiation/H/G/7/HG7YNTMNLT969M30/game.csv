"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $50?",50.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. Unfortunately, $50 is too low for me to sell the product. I'm willing to go down to $200. What do you think?",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $250 might be too high. How about we settle at $200? This is a fair price and a good deal for both of us.",200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a ways off from that price.  How about $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. However, $75 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to lower my price further to $175. Let me know if this works for you.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're still a bit apart on the price. I can come down to $175. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price. What do you say?",175.0,Alice,5,
