"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product. I value it at a minimum of $120, but I'm willing to discuss a reasonable price with you. What would you say to purchasing it for $100?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $70 is significantly below what I need for this product. The minimum I can accept is $120, which is its value to me. I do have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay that price, but I'd like to give you another opportunity. Could you meet me at $95? This would still represent a good value for you while being closer to what I need.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $75. This is the best I can do while still keeping it within my budget. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
