"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $70 is significantly below what I need for this product. The minimum I can accept is $120, which is its value to me. I do have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay that price, but I'd like to give you another opportunity. Could you meet me at $95? This would still represent a good value for you while being closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.
