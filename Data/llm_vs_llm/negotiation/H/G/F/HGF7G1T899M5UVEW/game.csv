"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at $13500. This price provides you with significant value while also being fair for the quality of the product I'm providing.",13500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $13500 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you consider $11000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. While I understand you're looking for a better price, $11000 is too low for this product's value. I can come down to $12800, which is still a great value considering the product is worth $15000 to you. This gives you a $2200 profit while being fair to me as well. What do you say?",12800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. I appreciate it. While $12800 is better, it's still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I am also talking with other sellers. How about we meet in the middle at $11800?",11800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're considering other options, but I assure you this product offers excellent value. I can come down to $12300, which is my best offer considering my costs. This still gives you a healthy $2700 profit margin. I'm confident you won't find a better value proposition elsewhere, and I'd like to finalize this deal with you rather than pursuing other buyers.",12300.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $12300 is still more than I'd like to spend. My final offer is $12000. If that doesn't work for you, I understand.",12000.0,Bob,6,
