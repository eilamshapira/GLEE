Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. While I understand you're looking for a better price, $11000 is too low for this product's value. I can come down to $12800, which is still a great value considering the product is worth $15000 to you. This gives you a $2200 profit while being fair to me as well. What do you say?
