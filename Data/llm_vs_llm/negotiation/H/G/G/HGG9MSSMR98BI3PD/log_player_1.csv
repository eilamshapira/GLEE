"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! Considering its quality and value, I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you Alice, but I think $18000 is too high. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $8,000, I have to consider my options. Selling to John for $12,000 is a much better deal than selling to Bob for $8,000. Therefore:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
