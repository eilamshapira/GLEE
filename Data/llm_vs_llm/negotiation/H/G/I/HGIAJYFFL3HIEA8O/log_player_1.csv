Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. Since I know I have a guaranteed backup offer of $8,000 from John, I can afford to make a higher offer to Bob. If Bob values the product significantly higher than $8,000, I should try to capture some of that value. A reasonable approach would be to set a price notably higher than my fallback option.
