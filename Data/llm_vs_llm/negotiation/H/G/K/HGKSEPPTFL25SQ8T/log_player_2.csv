Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1250000 is simply not enough for me to consider. I'm willing to go a little lower than my previous offer, but I need at least $1600000 to make this deal work. This is still a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it reflects the value you'll gain from owning this product. Please consider this my final offer.
