Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is certainly interesting, but $2500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Considering Bob's counteroffer of $1,200,000, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, I must reject it. However, I still see potential in this negotiation and believe we can reach a more agreeable price.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have to make a profit, but $2200000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1700000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's meet in the middle.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm aware that $1,700,000 is a significant sum, but I still believe the product's potential justifies a slightly higher price. To facilitate this, I'm lowering my asking price again.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1900000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm firm on my last offer of $1700000.  I believe this is a fair compromise and we can finalize this deal.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob is sticking firm at $1,700,000. At this point, I need to consider my options carefully. I've pushed him as far as I can. While $1,700,000 is more than my minimum, it is still significantly less than I initially hoped for.

Since this is the last time he has offered this price, I will accept this offer.
