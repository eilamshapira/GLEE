"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $95. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I believe the product is worth at least that much. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $105 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  I'm serious about buying this product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
