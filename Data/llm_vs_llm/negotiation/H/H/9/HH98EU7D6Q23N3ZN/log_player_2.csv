"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","The offer is $1,200,000, which is actually higher than what the product is worth to me (stated as no more than $1,000,000) and exactly matches what it's worth to Alice. Additionally, it's equivalent to John's price, so there's no advantage to accepting this offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has lowered her offer to $1,100,000, which is better than her initial offer but still higher than John's price of $1,000,000. Since John is offering the product for $1,000,000, and that's the maximum value for me anyway, it doesn't make sense to pay more than that.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly from my previous counteroffer, but still keep it below John's price to maintain negotiation leverage.

{""product_price"": $850,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has now offered the product for $1,000,000, which is the same price as John's offer and matches the maximum value of the product to me. Since the price is now equal to the alternative option, and it doesn't exceed what the product is worth to me, I can accept this offer.
