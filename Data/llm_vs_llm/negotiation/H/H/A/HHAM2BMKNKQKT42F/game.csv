"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $120 is a bit high for my budget. I can get a similar product from another seller for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $85? This would be a fair price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $85 is too close to my minimum threshold. Given that you mentioned you could get a similar product for $100 elsewhere, I can offer you this product for $110, which still gives you a better value than the alternative you mentioned. This is a quality product that will serve you well. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
