Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $120 is a bit high for my budget. I can get a similar product from another seller for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $85? This would be a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Given that you mentioned you could get a similar product for $100 elsewhere, I can offer you this product for $110, which still gives you a better value than the alternative you mentioned.
