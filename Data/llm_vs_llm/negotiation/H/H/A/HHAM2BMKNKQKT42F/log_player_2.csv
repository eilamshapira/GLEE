"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm selling a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $120. This is a competitive price for this product given its features and quality. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me think about this:
1. My maximum value for the product is $100
2. Alice is offering it for $120, which is above my maximum value
3. John is offering it for $100, which equals my maximum value
4. Since Alice's price is higher than my maximum value, I should reject it and try to negotiate a better price
5. If negotiations fail, I can always buy from John at $100

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $120 is a bit high for my budget. I can get a similar product from another seller for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $85? This would be a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $85 is too close to my minimum threshold. Given that you mentioned you could get a similar product for $100 elsewhere, I can offer you this product for $110, which still gives you a better value than the alternative you mentioned. This is a quality product that will serve you well. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Alice has dropped her price from $120 to $110
2. This is still above my maximum value of $100
3. John's offer of $100 is still available and matches my maximum value
4. Alice seems willing to negotiate but is still above what I'm willing to pay
5. Since $110 is still more than my maximum value of $100, and John's offer is available at $100, the rational choice would be to buy from John
