"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Based on the information provided, Alice's offer is $14,500, which is higher than what the product is worth to me (no more than $12,000) and also higher than John's selling price of $12,000.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and John is offering a better price that is within my valuation limit, the most rational decision would be to buy from John.
