"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $10000. I believe it's a great investment. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $10,000, which is $2,000 above my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $8,000, which matches my maximum value
4. Even if I make a counteroffer, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a price below $8,000

The logical choice is not to accept Alice's offer of $10,000 or continue negotiations when I have a guaranteed option to buy at my maximum value. Therefore:
