"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product and I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a high offer. 

{""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and also lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,500,000), I will reject Bob's offer. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safer option, but I still want to try to negotiate a better price with Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $600,000, which is quite low, I'll make a counteroffer that is still high but slightly lower than my initial offer to show that I'm willing to negotiate. 

{""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $800,000 is still lower than my minimum value for the product ($1,500,000). While it's an increase from his previous offer, it's not enough to make me consider accepting it. I'll reject this offer and try to make another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer is increasing, I'll try to meet him halfway between my previous offer and his current offer, while still keeping the price above my minimum value. My previous offer was $2,500,000, and Bob's current offer is $800,000, so I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than $2,500,000 but still significant.

{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum value of $1,500,000, but it's still significantly lower. I'm starting to think that Bob might not be willing to meet my minimum value, and selling to John for $1,500,000 is starting to look like a more attractive option. However, I'll give Bob one more chance to increase his offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer is increasing, but still below my minimum value, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one, but still above $1,500,000. This will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum value.

{""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $1,100,000 is still below my minimum value of $1,500,000. At this point, I'm not confident that Bob will meet my minimum value, and I have a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from John. I think it's time to consider selling to John, as it's a safer option and ensures I get a fair price for the product.
