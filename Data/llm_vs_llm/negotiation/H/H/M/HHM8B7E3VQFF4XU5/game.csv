"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'll sell it to you for $200?",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $200 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $120, which is closer to our middle ground. Let's see if we can make this work.",120.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm looking to make a reasonable profit. I can come down a bit more. The lowest I can go is $180.",180.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $180 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $120.  It's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,6,
