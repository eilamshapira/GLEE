"Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product looks promising, $12000 seems a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $8000 is too low considering the product's value. I can come down from my initial price, but I would need at least $10500 for this product. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's quality.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to being able to meet your offer.  Would you consider $9200?",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're making progress in our negotiation. I appreciate your increased offer of $9200, which shows we're moving in the right direction. However, I still need to get a bit more for this product. Would you be able to meet me at $9800? This is a significant reduction from my previous ask, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",9800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I think we're getting very close.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9500?",9500.0,Bob,6,
