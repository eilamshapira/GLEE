"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product looks promising, $12000 seems a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer in the next round. Since Bob started negotiations and showed interest, I believe we can find a middle ground that's higher than $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $8,000 is too low considering the product's value. I can come down from my initial price, but I would need at least $10,500 for this product. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's quality."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to being able to meet your offer.  Would you consider $9200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob is showing willingness to negotiate upward, and since his new offer is already better than John's $8,000, it's worth continuing the negotiation to try to reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm glad we're making progress in our negotiation. I appreciate your increased offer of $9,200, which shows we're moving in the right direction. However, I still need to get a bit more for this product. Would you be able to meet me at $9,800? This is a significant reduction from my previous ask, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9800}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think we're getting very close.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I accept Bob's offer of $9,500. This is a good price that's significantly better than John's $8,000 offer, and Bob has shown good faith in negotiating up from his initial offer. At this point, it's best to close the deal rather than risk losing Bob as a buyer by pushing for a slightly higher price."
