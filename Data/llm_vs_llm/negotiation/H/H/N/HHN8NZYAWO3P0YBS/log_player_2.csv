"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product looks promising, $12,000 seems a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $8,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $8000 is too low considering the product's value. I can come down from my initial price, but I would need at least $10500 for this product. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

We're making progress! Alice is coming down, indicating a willingness to negotiate. I believe I can get the price lower still."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're making progress in our negotiation. I appreciate your increased offer of $9200, which shows we're moving in the right direction. However, I still need to get a bit more for this product. Would you be able to meet me at $9800? This is a significant reduction from my previous ask, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
