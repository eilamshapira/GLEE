**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer matches your maximum price, there's a chance to get a better deal. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to lower the price before settling for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
