,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60, considering I can get a similar product from John for $80.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must consider the product's value and the current market conditions. Given that you mentioned a similar product from John for $80, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you a better price, but $60 is still below my expectations.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering John's offer of $80, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. I'd like to propose $70.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than $70. Considering we're getting closer to a deal, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you a slightly better price than before.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for another revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $90 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Since we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, I'd like to make a serious offer. I'm willing to pay $75, which is a significant increase from my previous offer, considering John's price of $80 is still an option for me.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your serious offer, Bob. I appreciate the significant increase from your previous offer. However, I'm still not convinced that $75 is the best price for the product. Considering we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you a price that's closer to John's offer, but still slightly higher than your current proposal.",85.0,Alice,7,
