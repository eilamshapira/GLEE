"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I have a strict budget constraint. I can offer you $600000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. Unfortunately, I cannot accept $600000 as this is below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value and my investment in it is substantial. I understand budget constraints, but I can offer it for $980000, which is already a considerable reduction from my initial price. This is a high-quality product with excellent market potential, and I believe this revised offer represents good value.",980000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $980000 is still beyond my budget. I can increase my offer to $700000. This is a fair price given my budget constraints.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but $700000 is still below what I can accept for this product. My absolute minimum price is $850000, which is significantly below my initial asking price and represents excellent value for what you're getting. I should note that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $800000, but I'm giving you priority in this negotiation because I believe you could make better use of this product. However, I cannot go below $850000 as that would not be economically viable for me.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for the information. I understand your position better now. However, I can only offer $750000 for the product. This is a substantial increase from my previous offers, and I hope you can consider it.",750000.0,Bob,6,
