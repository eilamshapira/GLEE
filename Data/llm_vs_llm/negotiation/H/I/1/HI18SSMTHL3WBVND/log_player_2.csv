Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. Unfortunately, I cannot accept $600000 as this is below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value and my investment in it is substantial. I understand budget constraints, but I can offer it for $980000, which is already a considerable reduction from my initial price. This is a high-quality product with excellent market potential, and I believe this revised offer represents good value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but $700000 is still below what I can accept for this product. My absolute minimum price is $850000, which is significantly below my initial asking price and represents excellent value for what you're getting. I should note that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $800000, but I'm giving you priority in this negotiation because I believe you could make better use of this product. However, I cannot go below $850000 as that would not be economically viable for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
