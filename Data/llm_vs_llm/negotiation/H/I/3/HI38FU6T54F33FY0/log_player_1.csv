Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a decision about the price to offer Bob. 

Given the information:
- The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me
- The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob
- If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for $1,500,000

Offering Bob any price below $1,500,000 would result in me earning less than I could get from John. Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, he would not accept any offer above that amount.

Since I can guarantee $1,500,000 by selling to John, and Bob won't pay more than $1,200,000, my optimal strategy is to offer Bob a price that I know he will reject, allowing me to sell to John instead.
