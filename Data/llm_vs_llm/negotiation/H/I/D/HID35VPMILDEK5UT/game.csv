"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000, considering my budget and the current market. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12000 is too low for this product's value. I've carefully considered your offer, but I cannot go below $17500. This is already a significant reduction from my initial price, and it reflects the true value of the product.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $17500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'd like to propose a price of $14750. This is a serious offer, and I'm prepared to make a decision if we can agree on this price.",14750.0,Bob,4,
