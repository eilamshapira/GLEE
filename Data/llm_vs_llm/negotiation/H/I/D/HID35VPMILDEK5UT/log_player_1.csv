Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $20,000. This is a competitive price for a product of this caliber."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000, considering my budget and the current market. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and I can still negotiate for a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is too low for this product's value. I've carefully considered your offer, but I cannot go below $17,500. This is already a significant reduction from my initial price, and it reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $17500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'd like to propose a price of $14750. This is a serious offer, and I'm prepared to make a decision if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $14,750 is below John's guaranteed offer of $15,000, and we've been negotiating without reaching a price above $15,000, it makes the most business sense to take John's offer. This ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoid further negotiation time and uncertainty."
