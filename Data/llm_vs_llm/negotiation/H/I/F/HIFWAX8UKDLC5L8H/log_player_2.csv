"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

While buying from John for $1,500,000 is the worst-case scenario, accepting Alice's offer for $1,300,000 allows you to save $200,000 compared to buying from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer and potentially negotiating with her further is risky as there's no guarantee she will lower her price."
