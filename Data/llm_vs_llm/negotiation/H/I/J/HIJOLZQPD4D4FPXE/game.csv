"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was looking to spend no more than $600000. Would you be open to negotiating the price down to this amount?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600000 is significantly below the product's value. The product is worth at least $1200000 to me based on market evaluations and its unique features. I understand you have budget constraints, but I can offer it at $1300000, which is already a reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects the true value of what you're getting.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1300000 is still quite high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $700000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I hope it shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, which shows your interest in the product. However, $700000 is still well below what this product is worth. My absolute minimum is $1200000, which is the baseline value of this product to me. I should mention that I have another interested buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at this price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can come down to $1200000 as my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
