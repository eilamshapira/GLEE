Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600000 is significantly below the product's value. The product is worth at least $1200000 to me based on market evaluations and its unique features. I understand you have budget constraints, but I can offer it at $1300000, which is already a reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects the true value of what you're getting.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Counteroffer: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still quite high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $700,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I hope it shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, which shows your interest in the product. However, $700000 is still well below what this product is worth. My absolute minimum is $1200000, which is the baseline value of this product to me. I should mention that I have another interested buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at this price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can come down to $1200000 as my final offer.

Message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget. I have decided to purchase the product from another seller who is offering it at a price that fits my budget. Thank you for your time and understanding."
