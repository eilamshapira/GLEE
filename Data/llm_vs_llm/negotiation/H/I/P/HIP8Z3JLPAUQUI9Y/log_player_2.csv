"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's price ($1,200,000), and it's also the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I should reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price with Alice. Even if the negotiation fails, I can still buy from John at the same price later.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a significantly lower offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low that it would be considered unreasonable. Since my maximum is $1,200,000, I'll start at about 60% of that value.
