"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value ($1,200,000) and also higher than John's price ($1,200,000). It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations with Alice don't improve, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 900000}

I'll start with a relatively low counteroffer of $900,000. This gives room for negotiation while still being a reasonable starting point. It's significantly below both John's price and Alice's cost, but as a negotiation strategy, it's better to start low and allow for upward movement. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground that's below John's price of $1,200,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has lowered her price from $1,500,000 to $1,380,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but this price is still significantly above John's offer of $1,200,000. There's no reason to accept a price higher than what John is offering. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, trying to get a price below $1,200,000. If Alice won't go below John's price, I can always take John's offer later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm increasing my offer to $1,000,000, which is a $100,000 increase from my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate in good faith and move toward a middle ground. This price is still well below John's price of $1,200,000, giving Alice room to profit while potentially saving me money compared to John's offer. If Alice rejects this, I can continue to gradually increase my offer while keeping it below $1,200,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has dropped her price to $1,300,000, showing continued willingness to negotiate, but this is still $100,000 above John's offer of $1,200,000. There's no reason to accept this price when I can either get a better deal from Alice or fall back on John's lower price. I'll make another counteroffer, continuing to work towards a price below $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm increasing my offer to $1,100,000, which is another $100,000 increase from my previous offer. Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing her price significantly from the initial $1,500,000 to $1,300,000. My new offer of $1,100,000 is still $100,000 below John's price, which gives Alice incentive to consider it while potentially saving me money. This also leaves some room for further negotiation while staying under the $1,200,000 threshold."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($1,250,000) is still $50,000 above John's price ($1,200,000)
2. While Alice has been gradually lowering her price, she's shown resistance to going below $1,200,000
3. We've already gone through 7 rounds, and with only 3 rounds left, there's a risk of not reaching a better deal
4. The product is worth exactly $1,200,000 to Alice, so it's unlikely she'll go much below that price
5. John's offer of $1,200,000 is guaranteed and available now

It's best to take the sure deal with John rather than risk further negotiation rounds that might not lead to a better outcome."
