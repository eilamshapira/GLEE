"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and Alice's offer of $110 is less than John's fixed price of $120, I can either accept this offer or try to negotiate for a better price. Given that I have 9 more rounds available and the product is worth $80 to Alice, I believe I can negotiate for a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $80 to Alice and $120 to me, I'll try to get a fair price by starting with a lower offer, leaving room for negotiation.
