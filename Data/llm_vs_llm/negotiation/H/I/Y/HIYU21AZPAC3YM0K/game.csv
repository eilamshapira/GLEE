"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Based on its market value and unique features, I'm offering it at $2000000. This is a competitive price considering the product's quality and potential value.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2000000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $600000 for the product, considering its potential value to me. Let me know if this works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600000 is too low for this product. Given its market value and features, I can offer it to you for $1800000. This is a reduction from my initial price and represents good value for the product's potential.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1800000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $700000, which I believe is a fair price considering my constraints. Let me know if you can meet me at this price.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but $700000 is still well below the product's value. I can come down to $1500000, which is a substantial reduction from my previous offers. This price better reflects both the product's true value and my flexibility in reaching an agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1500000 is still too high for me. I can stretch my budget to $750000, which is my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I might have to consider other options. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,6,
