Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2000000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $600000 for the product, considering its potential value to me. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Since I have John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000, I won't accept anything lower than that. However, I'll try one more time with Bob at a lower price than my initial offer.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is too low for this product. Given its market value and features, I can offer it to you for $1,800,000. This is a reduction from my initial price and represents good value for the product's potential.""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1800000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $700000, which I believe is a fair price considering my constraints. Let me know if you can meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

I'll make another counteroffer. Bob's offer of $700,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and he's only increased his offer by $100,000. While I want to try to negotiate with Bob, I'm noticing he's making very small increases in his offers. I'll lower my price more significantly to see if we can move closer to a middle ground.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but $700,000 is still well below the product's value.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1500000 is still too high for me. I can stretch my budget to $750000, which is my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I might have to consider other options. Let me know what you think.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've decided to sell to John for $1,200,000. Bob's negotiation pattern shows he's unlikely to reach a price anywhere near my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. His latest offer of $750,000 is still significantly below this threshold, and he's indicated this is his final offer while only increasing by small increments ($50,000) from his previous offer. Given that John's offer is guaranteed at $1,200,000, which is $450,000 more than Bob's ""final"" offer, it makes the most financial sense to end the negotiation with Bob and sell to John."
