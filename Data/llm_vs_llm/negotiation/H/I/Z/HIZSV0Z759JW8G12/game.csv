"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $12000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to lower my price to $18000, which still offers great value for the product. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $16500. This is a significant discount from my original offer and should be within a reasonable range for you. What do you say?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16500 is still a bit above my budget. Considering your original price and my previous offer, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13500. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to finalize the deal at this price.",13500.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to lower my price further to $16000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you!",16000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop the price to $15500, which is very close to my minimum. This is the best I can do while still valuing the product appropriately. Let me know if this works for you!",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $15500 is still slightly above what I'm willing to pay. Given that we're very close, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14500. If this isn't acceptable, I may need to consider other options that better fit my budget.",14500.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $14500 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to go down to $15250, which is my final offer. This price reflects a significant discount and should meet your needs while still being fair to me. Let me know if you can accept this offer.",15250.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I really want to make this work for both of us. I'm willing to lower the price to $15250, which is my final offer. This is the lowest I can go while still valuing the product appropriately. Please let me know if you can accept this offer.",15250.0,Alice,7,
