"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $14999. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $14,999 exceeds that value, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $10,000, which is within my budget.
