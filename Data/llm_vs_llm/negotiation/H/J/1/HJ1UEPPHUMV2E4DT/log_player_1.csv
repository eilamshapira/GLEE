Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product that I believe will bring you great value. After careful consideration, I'm willing to let it go for a price that I think is fair and reasonable."", ""product_price"": 9800}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I think $9800 is quite steep considering market conditions. The product is worth around $8500 to me based on my research. I'd like to offer you $8500, which I believe is fair and gives you a reasonable profit margin. I look forward to doing business with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the time you took to research the product and come up with a price that you feel is fair. However, I have to consider my own costs and the value I believe the product holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's worth to both of us."", ""product_price"": 9150}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. Your compromise shows good faith, but I still feel we can find a more equitable middle ground. The product costs you $8000, and I understand you need to make a profit. I'm willing to increase my offer to $8800, which gives you a 10% profit margin on your cost. This is fair considering I could always purchase from John at $10000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer and for sharing your thought process. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer and meet me closer to my target price. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a slightly higher price. Considering your last offer and my original price, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'll lower my price to $9000, which I think is a fair compromise and still reflects the product's worth to both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, we're making good progress in our negotiation. I appreciate you bringing the price down to $9000. We're getting closer, but I believe we can meet at a price that's fair for both of us. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8900. This gives you a respectable profit while allowing me to purchase at a price that makes sense for my budget. I think this compromise reflects the value of the product while acknowledging our mutual interests. Do we have a deal?
