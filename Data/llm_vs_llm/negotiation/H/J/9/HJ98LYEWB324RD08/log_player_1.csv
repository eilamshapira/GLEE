Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2,500,000}

I'm starting with a relatively high offer since I know the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I have John's offer as a safety net. This gives me room to negotiate while still potentially securing a better deal than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject Bob's offer of $500,000 because it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 (John's offer). Bob's offer is only one-third of what I can get from John, so it wouldn't make any sense to accept it. I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round, adjusting my initial price downward but still keeping it well above my minimum threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2,000,000}

I'm lowering my asking price by $500,000 from my initial offer to show flexibility in negotiation, but still maintaining a price that would give me significantly better returns than John's offer. This price point signals that while I'm willing to negotiate, I won't consider offers far below market value. If Bob is seriously interested, this reduction should encourage him to make a more reasonable counteroffer closer to the actual value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject Bob's offer of $600,000 because it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While Bob has increased his offer slightly from $500,000 to $600,000, this minimal increase suggests he might not be a serious buyer willing to pay fair market value. However, I'll make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a more reasonable price point before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1,800,000}

I'm lowering my price again to $1,800,000 to show continued willingness to negotiate, but I'm maintaining a firm position well above my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. Bob's previous offers have been extremely low, and the small increment in his last counteroffer ($100,000) suggests he might not be willing to pay a fair price. If Bob doesn't respond with a substantially higher offer this time, I may need to seriously consider taking John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I choose to sell to John for $1,500,000. The negotiation pattern with Bob shows he's not willing to make substantial increases in his offers (moving from $500,000 to $600,000 to $700,000 in small $100,000 increments). At this rate, it would take many more rounds to even approach my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, if at all. Bob's latest offer of $700,000 is still less than half of John's guaranteed offer. Given Bob's negotiation behavior and the significant gap between his offers and my minimum acceptable price, it's more prudent to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John rather than continue this unproductive negotiation."
