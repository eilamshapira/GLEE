"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I should analyze this situation to find the best strategy for maximizing my savings.

Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is exactly the same price that John is offering and exactly equal to my maximum value for the product. This means:

1. If I accept Alice's offer, I pay $15,000
2. If I buy from John, I also pay $15,000
3. If I reject and make a counteroffer, there's a possibility I might get it for less than $15,000

Since there's no downside to attempting negotiation with Alice (I can always fall back to John's offer if needed), I should reject and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price to leave room for negotiation, but still reasonable enough to be taken seriously.

{""product_price"": $10,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has now offered $14,500, which is $500 less than both her initial offer and John's fixed price. This is progress in the negotiation.

Let's evaluate my options:
1. Accept Alice's offer: I pay $14,500
2. Reject and make another counteroffer: Possibility to negotiate further down
3. Buy from John: I pay $15,000 (this is clearly worse than option 1)

Since Alice moved $500 in my direction, it suggests she has room to negotiate further. There's no risk in continuing to negotiate since I can always accept a later offer from Alice (if it doesn't get worse) or fall back to John's offer as a last resort.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down $500 from her initial offer, I'll continue the negotiation by moving up from my initial offer, but still keeping a good margin for potential savings.
