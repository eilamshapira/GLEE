"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1000000 is significantly below my acceptable price. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but not that far. My new offer is $1400000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for reconsidering and coming down to $1400000, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still believe we can find a better middle ground. Considering the product's value to me and the fact that I can purchase it from John for $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new offer. My counteroffer is $1200000.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
