Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it for $20000. Let me know what you think!,20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $20000 is significantly beyond what I'm looking to spend. The product is worth no more than $12000 to me, and I actually have another seller (John) who's willing to sell it to me at that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Would you consider a price of $8000? This would give me a reason to choose you over my alternative option.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. While I can't go as low as $8000, I'm willing to offer you a special price of $17500. This is a fantastic product and I believe it's worth it. Let me know your thoughts!",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, $17500 is still significantly above what the product is worth to me, and well above John's offer of $12000. To be completely transparent, I can purchase this exact product from John for $12000 right now, but I'd still prefer to do business with you if we can find a fair price. I'm willing to meet you more than halfway at $10000, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that you're looking for a better price. How about I meet you at $15500? This is a fair compromise between your budget and the value of the product. Let me know if that works for you!",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate you coming down further on the price, Alice. Your willingness to negotiate shows you're serious about making a deal. However, I need to be direct - I still can't go above $12000, which is what John is charging and the maximum value of the product to me. To give you an incentive to beat John's offer, I'm willing to pay $11000. This gives you a sale today rather than losing my business completely, and saves me $1000 compared to my alternative. I hope we can close the deal at this price.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your transparency about your budget. I understand that $11000 is your maximum, but I would like to propose a final price of $14000. This offers you a better option than John's while still reflecting the product's value. I hope we can find common ground!",14000.0,Alice,7,
