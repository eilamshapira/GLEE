Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it for $20,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $20000 is significantly beyond what I'm looking to spend. The product is worth no more than $12000 to me, and I actually have another seller (John) who's willing to sell it to me at that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Would you consider a price of $8000? This would give me a reason to choose you over my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. While I can't go as low as $8,000, I'm willing to offer you a special price of $17,500. This is a fantastic product and I believe it's worth it. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, $17500 is still significantly above what the product is worth to me, and well above John's offer of $12000. To be completely transparent, I can purchase this exact product from John for $12000 right now, but I'd still prefer to do business with you if we can find a fair price. I'm willing to meet you more than halfway at $10000, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that you're looking for a better price. How about I meet you at $15,500? This is a fair compromise between your budget and the value of the product. Let me know if that works for you!"", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down further on the price, Alice. Your willingness to negotiate shows you're serious about making a deal. However, I need to be direct - I still can't go above $12000, which is what John is charging and the maximum value of the product to me. To give you an incentive to beat John's offer, I'm willing to pay $11000. This gives you a sale today rather than losing my business completely, and saves me $1000 compared to my alternative. I hope we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your transparency about your budget. I understand that $11,000 is your maximum, but I would like to propose a final price of $14,000. This offers you a better option than John's while still reflecting the product's value. I hope we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
