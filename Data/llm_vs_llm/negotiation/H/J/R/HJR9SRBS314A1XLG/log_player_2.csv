"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it for $20000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","The offer from Alice is quite high at $20,000, which exceeds the maximum value of $12,000 that the product is worth to me. It doesn't make sense to accept this offer, and I should either negotiate with Alice or take John's guaranteed offer of $12,000.

Since I have the option to buy from John at any time for $12,000, I'll try negotiating with Alice first to see if I can get a better deal.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $20,000 is significantly beyond what I'm looking to spend. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and I actually have another seller (John) who's willing to sell it to me at that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Would you consider a price of $8,000? This would give me a reason to choose you over my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. While I can't go as low as $8000, I'm willing to offer you a special price of $17500. This is a fantastic product and I believe it's worth it. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $17,500 is still well above the $12,000 maximum value of the product to me, and it's also higher than John's guaranteed price of $12,000. While Alice has come down from her initial offer, the reduction isn't sufficient to make it a good deal for me.

Since John's offer of $12,000 is still better than Alice's current offer, I'll continue negotiating with Alice to see if she'll reduce her price further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, $17,500 is still significantly above what the product is worth to me, and well above John's offer of $12,000. To be completely transparent, I can purchase this exact product from John for $12,000 right now, but I'd still prefer to do business with you if we can find a fair price. I'm willing to meet you more than halfway at $10,000, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that you're looking for a better price. How about I meet you at $15500? This is a fair compromise between your budget and the value of the product. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $15,500, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but this is still $3,500 more than John's offer of $12,000. Since the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, paying $15,500 would mean I'm losing value on this transaction.

Given that Alice seems to be moving down in price but still staying well above John's offer, and considering we're already in round 5 of 10, I should continue negotiating but also be prepared to take John's offer if Alice doesn't come down enough.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down further on the price, Alice. Your willingness to negotiate shows you're serious about making a deal. However, I need to be direct - I still can't go above $12,000, which is what John is charging and the maximum value of the product to me. To give you an incentive to beat John's offer, I'm willing to pay $11,000. This gives you a sale today rather than losing my business completely, and saves me $1,000 compared to my alternative. I hope we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your transparency about your budget. I understand that $11000 is your maximum, but I would like to propose a final price of $14000. This offers you a better option than John's while still reflecting the product's value. I hope we can find common ground! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has now offered $14,000, which is still $2,000 above John's price of $12,000. Since the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, accepting Alice's offer would mean I'm paying more than the product's value.

We're now in round 7 of 10, and Alice has been reducing her price but still remains above the $12,000 threshold that makes sense for me. At this point, I need to decide whether to continue negotiating, hoping Alice might eventually come down to $12,000 or below, or to take John's guaranteed offer.

Since John's offer is still better than Alice's, and I need to ensure I don't end up with a worse deal, I'll go with John's offer.
