,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand $60 is your budget, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'll sell it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $70 for the product, which is a more reasonable price considering my budget.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. Look, I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $105? That's the best I can do.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $105 is still above my limit. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product, and I think that's a fair price considering the negotiations we've had so far.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're still apart on the price. Look, I really want to make this deal. I'll come down to $100. This is my absolute final offer.",100.0,Alice,7,
