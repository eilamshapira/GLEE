"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $60 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Considering Bob's offer of $60, and knowing I can get $100 from John, I have to make a choice. Selling to Bob for $60 is significantly less than my alternative.

Therefore, my decision is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand $60 is your budget, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'll sell it to you for $110."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $70 for the product, which is a more reasonable price considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","I'm still not happy with $70, especially when I know I can get $100 from John. I have to think strategically. The longer I negotiate with Bob, the more risk there is that he'll walk away.

Therefore, my decision is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, here's my next counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. Look, I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $105? That's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $105 is still above my limit. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product, and I think that's a fair price considering the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","I'm getting closer to the point where I should sell to John. $75 is still not good enough. I've already spent a few rounds negotiating, and there's no guarantee Bob will budge much further. It's time to consider my options more carefully.

Therefore, my decision is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're still apart on the price. Look, I really want to make this deal. I'll come down to $100. This is my absolute final offer."", ""product_price"": 100}"
