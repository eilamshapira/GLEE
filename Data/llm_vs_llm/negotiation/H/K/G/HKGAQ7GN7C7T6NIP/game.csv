"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. I believe it's truly valuable and I'm offering it to you for $250. This is a competitive price for the quality you're getting. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product.  While I believe it's of high quality, $250 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $80, I'm afraid that's significantly below the product's value. The quality and features of this item justify a higher price point. I understand budget constraints, so I could come down to $210. This is already a substantial discount from my initial offer. How does that sound?",210.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this product has value, but $210 is still above my price range. I can offer $95, which I feel is a fair price. If that's not workable for you, I understand, but I hope we can find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your offer of $95. However, that's still quite a bit below what the product is worth. I understand you have budget constraints, but I need to consider the value of the item. I can come down to $180, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This is a quality product that will serve you well. Would you be able to meet me at this price?",180.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility so far.  While I appreciate the discounts you've offered, my absolute maximum budget for this product is $100.  If you're unable to meet that price, I completely understand, but I won't be able to go any higher.",100.0,Bob,6,
