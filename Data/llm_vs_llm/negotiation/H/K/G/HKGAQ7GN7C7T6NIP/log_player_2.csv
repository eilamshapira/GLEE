Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $80, I'm afraid that's significantly below the product's value. The quality and features of this item justify a higher price point. I understand budget constraints, so I could come down to $210. This is already a substantial discount from my initial offer. How does that sound?
