"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",80.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer, but $80 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to go down to $130 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",130.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to meet a certain price point. How about we settle at $125? This is the lowest I can go while still making it work for me.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $90 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",90.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $90 still doesn't meet my minimum price. I can go down to $122 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",122.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I need to stick to my minimum price. How about $121? This is really the lowest I can go.",121.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to lower the price, but $121 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle at $95. If we can't agree on this price, I may need to consider other options.",95.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I really can't go below $120. This is my absolute minimum. If you can meet this price, we have a deal. Otherwise, I might have to consider selling to someone else.",120.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I've gone as low as I can. My final offer is $120. If you can meet this price, we can close the deal today. Let me know your decision.",120.0,Alice,7,
