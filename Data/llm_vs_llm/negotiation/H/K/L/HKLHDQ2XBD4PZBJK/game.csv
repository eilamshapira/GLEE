"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was hoping to spend less on the product. Would you be willing to sell it for $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, and I can offer it to you for $130.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that we're still a bit apart on the price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $70, but that's still quite a bit less than what you're asking for. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $70 is still below my expectations. I'm willing to make a concession and offer the product to you for $125. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with so far.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're making a concession, but $125 is still quite a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm willing to increase my offer to $75, but that's as high as I can go at this point. Would you be willing to accept this offer?",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but $75 is still not a price I'm comfortable with. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $120. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",120.0,Alice,7,
