"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's alternative price ($1,500,000). It would be unwise to accept this offer. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer to try to negotiate a better price with Alice. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'll offer $1,200,000, which is below both John's price and Alice's cost. This gives room for negotiation while potentially saving money compared to John's price. Since Alice's cost is $1,500,000, they might counter with a higher price, but starting lower gives me room to negotiate up while still potentially getting a better deal than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's new offer of $1,800,000 is still higher than John's price of $1,500,000, and also higher than my maximum value of $1,500,000, it makes the most economic sense to buy from John. Alice seems unlikely to go below her cost of $1,500,000, and continuing negotiations when there's a guaranteed fair price available would not be productive. Therefore, I'll take John's offer of $1,500,000."
