"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1400000 is a bit high for me. How about we settle on $1100000? Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $1100000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1300000 is still a bit out of my budget. Could we meet at $1200000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also fitting my financial constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price. While your counteroffer is tempting, I believe the product's inherent value warrants a slightly higher price. I'd be willing to close the deal at $1250000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise.  Let me know your decision.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
