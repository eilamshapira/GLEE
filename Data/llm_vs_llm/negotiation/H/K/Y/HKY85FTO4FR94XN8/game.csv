"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60, considering I can get a similar product from John for $80. I believe $60 is a fair price for both of us.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and quality, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $100, which is still a better deal than what John is offering isn't an option for you with me, but is with him. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle between my previous offer and your revised offer. How about we settle on $70? I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us.",70.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, $70 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $90, which is the lowest price I'm willing to go. If this doesn't work for you, I may need to consider other options. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",90.0,Alice,5,
