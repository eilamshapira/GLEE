Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60, considering I can get a similar product from John for $80. I believe $60 is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
