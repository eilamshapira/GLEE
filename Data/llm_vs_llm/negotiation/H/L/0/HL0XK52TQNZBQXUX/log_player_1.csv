Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. Since I know I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John as a backup, I can be somewhat aggressive in my pricing to Bob. I should price it high enough to make a good profit, but not so high that Bob will certainly reject it. I'll set a price that gives Bob room to accept if the product has high value to him.
