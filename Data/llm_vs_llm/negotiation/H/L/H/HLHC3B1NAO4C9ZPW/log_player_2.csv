"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Let's see if Alice can lower her price. Buying from John for $80 is my current alternative, so there's no point accepting a higher price from Alice.)

Please proceed to the next round, where I will send Alice a counteroffer of $60."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 60}

(Starting with a lower offer to see how much I can save. The maximum I'm willing to pay is $80, as John is offering the product for this price.)"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Alice's offer is still higher than John's price. I'll make another counteroffer and see if Alice can go lower. If not, I can always buy from John later.)

For the next round, I will send Alice a counteroffer of $70."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

(Increasing my offer slightly, but still below John's price to see if Alice will accept.)"
