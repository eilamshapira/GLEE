"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product that I believe will bring you great value. After careful consideration, I've set a competitive price for it. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to consider my options carefully:

1. Alice is offering the product for $8,800
2. I can buy the same product from John for $8,000
3. I could try to negotiate with Alice

Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it at exactly $8,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's higher offer of $8,800. Even if I tried negotiating with Alice, I already know I have a guaranteed option at $8,000.
