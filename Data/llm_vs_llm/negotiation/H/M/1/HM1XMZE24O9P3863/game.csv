"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is a bit high for me. I know I can get this product from another seller for $150. I'd like to offer you $130 for it, which would still give you a good deal while saving me some money. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I understand where you're coming from, $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $155? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
