Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is a bit high for me. I know I can get this product from another seller for $150. I'd like to offer you $130 for it, which would still give you a good deal while saving me some money. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I understand where you're coming from, $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $155? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 155}"
