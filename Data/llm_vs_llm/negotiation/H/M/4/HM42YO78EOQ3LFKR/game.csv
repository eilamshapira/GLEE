"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $11000 is quite high for this product. Given the market conditions and comparable products, I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate you coming back with a price, but I think we can do better. How about $10500? It's a fair price that still provides you with a significant discount from the value you place on the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $10500 is still quite high. I can move up to $9500, which would give you a very healthy profit margin while being more aligned with market prices. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making this deal work.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand, Bob. Let's try to meet in the middle. How about $10000? I'm confident this price is a win-win for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
