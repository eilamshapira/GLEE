"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product. Considering its value, I'm asking for $11,000."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $11000 is quite high for this product. Given the market conditions and comparable products, I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Considering Bob's offer of $9,000, which is still above my minimum, I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $10500 is still quite high. I can move up to $9500, which would give you a very healthy profit margin while being more aligned with market prices. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
