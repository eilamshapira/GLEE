"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'm looking for $100, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me think through this scenario:

I'm looking for a product worth no more than $100 to me, and I have these options:
1. Accept Alice's offer at $100
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John for $100

Both Alice and John are offering the same price of $100. Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, I would be indifferent between these options from a purely financial perspective. 

However, since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, I should try to negotiate with Alice (by rejecting her current offer) since the product is only worth $80 to her, meaning she might be willing to lower her price.
