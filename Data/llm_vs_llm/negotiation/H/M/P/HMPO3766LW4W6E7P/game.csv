"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While $9000 is a step in the right direction, I need to get more value for this product given its quality and features. I can come down from my initial price and offer it to you for $10500. This is a significant reduction from my initial asking price and represents excellent value for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
