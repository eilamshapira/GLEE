Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $12,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While the product seems interesting, I'm not comfortable with $12000. I'm willing to offer $9000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. While $9,000 is better than my minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation since Bob showed interest and made a reasonable first counter. I'll try to meet somewhere in the middle between his $9,000 and my initial $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a step in the right direction, I need to get more value for this product given its quality and features. I can come down from my initial price and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial asking price and represents excellent value for the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
