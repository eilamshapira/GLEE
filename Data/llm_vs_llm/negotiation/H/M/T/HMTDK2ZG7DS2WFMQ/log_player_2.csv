"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Looking at Alice's offer, I notice that she's asking for $12,000, which is exactly the maximum amount I'm willing to pay and exactly the same as John's price.

Since the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and Alice is offering it at my maximum price, there's no advantage in accepting her offer over buying from John. However, I could try to negotiate with Alice for a better price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price to $11,000, which is now $1,000 less than both my maximum price and John's price. This is a good improvement and represents real savings. Since the product is worth up to $12,000 to me, getting it for $11,000 gives me $1,000 in surplus value.

I could try to negotiate further, but there's also a risk Alice might not be willing to go much lower and could potentially increase her price in future rounds if negotiations become difficult.
