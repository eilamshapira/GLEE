"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Looking at the options:

1. Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000
2. I can reject Alice's offer
3. I can buy from John for $1,200,000

The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, and Alice's offer ($1,500,000) exceeds this value. John's offer matches exactly what the product is worth to me at maximum.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, I should choose the option that costs me less while still getting the product.
