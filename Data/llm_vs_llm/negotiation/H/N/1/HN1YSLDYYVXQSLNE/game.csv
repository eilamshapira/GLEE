"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm looking to spend closer to $10000. Would you consider $9500?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $10500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $10100? That's a fair compromise, I think.",10100.0,Bob,4,
