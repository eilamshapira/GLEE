"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. Based on market analysis, this product has a premium quality that justifies a price of $120. This is a fair offer considering the product's true value of $150 to you, which would still give you a $30 surplus. I hope you find this offer reasonable, as I have other interested buyers including John who is ready to purchase at $80 if we don't reach an agreement.",120.0,Alice,1,
