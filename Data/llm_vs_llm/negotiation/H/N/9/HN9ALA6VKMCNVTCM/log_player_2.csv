"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. Based on market analysis, this product has a premium quality that justifies a price of $120. This is a fair offer considering the product's true value of $150 to you, which would still give you a $30 surplus. I hope you find this offer reasonable, as I have other interested buyers including John who is ready to purchase at $80 if we don't reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
