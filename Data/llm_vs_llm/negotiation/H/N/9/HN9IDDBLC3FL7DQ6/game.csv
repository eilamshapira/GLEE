"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is significantly above my budget. Given market conditions and comparable products, I would be willing to pay $650000 for the product. This is a fair offer that would still provide you with a good return.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1200000 may be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $650000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to offer the product to you for $1100000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $1100000 is still significantly above what I can justify paying for this product. I can increase my previous offer to $725000, which represents a substantial increase from my initial proposal. This offer reflects the product's fair market value while considering my budget constraints.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $725000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for continuing to work with me on the price, Alice. I can see you're making an effort to reduce the price, but $1050000 is still well above what I can pay. I'm willing to increase my offer to $775000. This is very close to my absolute maximum budget and represents a significant increase from my previous offers. I hope we can find common ground near this price point.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer again. I understand that $1050000 may be out of your reach, but I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in between. I'm willing to reduce my price further to $1000000, which is a significant compromise on my part. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair offer considering our negotiations.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
