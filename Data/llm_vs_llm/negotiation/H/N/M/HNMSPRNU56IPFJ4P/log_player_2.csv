Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my premium product, which is a unique piece, at a price of $12000. This price reflects its exceptional quality and value. If this offer interests you, I'd be happy to discuss further details, or if you have a different price in mind, feel free to propose a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I should analyze Alice's offer compared to my alternatives.

Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is $3,000 less than John's price of $15,000. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, so Alice's offer is already saving me money compared to my outside option.

While I could try to negotiate for an even lower price, Alice's initial offer is reasonable and already provides significant savings. Given that I want to buy the product while saving money, accepting this offer achieves my goal.
