"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

This is the clear best choice because:
1. Alice's offer ($200) is significantly higher than my maximum value ($120)
2. John's price ($120) exactly matches my maximum value
3. Even if I tried to negotiate with Alice, there's no guarantee she would go below $120
4. Buying from John immediately saves time and guarantees I get the product at my maximum acceptable price"
