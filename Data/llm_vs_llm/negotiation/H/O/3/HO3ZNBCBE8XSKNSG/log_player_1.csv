"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a high initial offer allows room for negotiation and helps gauge Bob's interest and the product's potential value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** While $1,000,000 is a significant amount and closer to my desired range, I still have room to negotiate. Rejecting this offer signals to Bob that I value the product highly and am willing to hold out for a better price. I'm not yet at a point where accepting John's $800,000 offer is necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1125000}

**Reasoning:** I'm lowering my price to show a willingness to negotiate but remain firm above the $1,000,000 mark. This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still pursuing a price that reflects the product's high value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting and countering again, I signal that I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. The difference between his current offer and John's offer is significant enough to warrant continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1090000}

**Reasoning:** I am reducing my previous counteroffer by a smaller margin this time, signaling that I am getting closer to my desired price. This encourages Bob to continue negotiating while also demonstrating that I am willing to make concessions."
