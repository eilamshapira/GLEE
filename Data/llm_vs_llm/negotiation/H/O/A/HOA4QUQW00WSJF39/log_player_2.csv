"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer matches our alternative option (buying from John), there's a chance we can get a better price.  It's worth starting the negotiation process to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer (about 33% less) allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a much better deal. It also leaves room for negotiation if she counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice dropping her price by $1,000 suggests there's room for further negotiation.  We're still well below our alternative ($15,000 from John), so it's worth pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:** We're increasing our offer slightly to show willingness to move, but still aiming for a price significantly lower than both Alice's current offer and John's price. This keeps the pressure on Alice while keeping us in a good negotiating position."
