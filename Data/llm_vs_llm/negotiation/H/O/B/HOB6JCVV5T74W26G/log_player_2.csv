"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's price ($1,000,000), and I want to save as much money as possible, I'll reject Alice's offer. This might lead Alice to come back with a lower offer, which would be better for me. If Alice doesn't make a better offer, I can always buy from John at the same price later."
