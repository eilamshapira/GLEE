"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and I have John's offer as a backup, I'll start with a low counteroffer to negotiate with Alice.

The price is still way above my maximum value ($8,000) and John's offer. There's no reason to accept this high price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly but still keep it well below my maximum value of $8,000, as I can always fall back on John's offer.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offers are consistently staying far above my maximum value of $8,000, and she's not making significant concessions in her prices. Since John's offer of $8,000 is available and matches my maximum value, it's best to take this guaranteed option rather than continue negotiating with Alice, who seems unwilling to come down to a reasonable price range."
