Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine my offering price to Bob. 

The product is worth at least $150 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at exactly $150.

Bob values the product at $120, which means he won't rationally accept any offer above $120.

Since any price I offer Bob below $150 would result in less profit than selling to John, and Bob won't accept any price above $120, the optimal decision is to offer Bob a price that he will reject, allowing me to sell to John for $150.

I'll offer a price above Bob's valuation to ensure he rejects it.
