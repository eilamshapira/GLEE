"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given that Alice's offer of $25,000 exceeds the product's worth to me ($15,000) and is also higher than John's guaranteed price of $15,000, it makes no sense to accept this offer.

Since John is offering the product at exactly the maximum I'm willing to pay ($15,000), I could buy from him immediately. However, I might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice, so I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, and John's price is guaranteed, I'll reject this offer and make one more counteroffer. If Alice doesn't come down to at least match John's price in the next round, I can always go with John's option.
