"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given that the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and John is offering the product for exactly $120, Alice's offer of $250 is significantly higher than what I'd be willing to pay.

Alice's price is more than double what John is offering, so it makes no sense to accept this offer. I should either reject and make a counteroffer, or buy from John right away.

Since I have the option to make counteroffers and potentially get a better deal than John's $120, I'll try negotiating with Alice first.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's below my maximum value but gives room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $220. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $220
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has lowered her price from $250 to $220, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $220 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $120, and it's also above my maximum value of $120.

Since Alice came down by $30, it suggests she may be willing to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a price below John's $120.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down $30 from her initial offer, I'll increase my offer a bit to show good faith in the negotiation while still keeping well below my maximum value and John's price.

{""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has lowered her price again, now to $200. She's coming down in increments of $20-30 per round, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but we're still far from an acceptable price.

At $200, her offer is still $80 more than John's price of $120, and it's still above my maximum value. Since we have several rounds left and Alice seems to be making significant reductions, I'll continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has reduced her price by $50 over two rounds, showing significant movement. I'll increase my offer to show that I'm also negotiating in good faith, but I'll still keep it well below John's price of $120.
