"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but 1800000 is above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $500000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1500000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, 1500000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle of my previous offer and your new offer? I'd be willing to pay 750000, but I'm also considering other options.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is still quite low. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a significant reduction from my original asking price.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the reduction, but 1350000 is still out of my budget. I'm getting close to exploring other options, such as buying from John for 1000000. I'd be willing to pay 900000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. If we can't agree on a price, I'll have to consider other alternatives.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're both trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer willing to pay this price.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
