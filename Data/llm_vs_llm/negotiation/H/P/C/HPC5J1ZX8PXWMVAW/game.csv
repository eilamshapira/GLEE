"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  I think it could really benefit you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $9000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $9000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $15000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $15000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $10500. I think this is a reasonable offer, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be honest, $10500 is cutting it pretty close to my bottom line. I could let it go for $13000.  I'm hoping we can close this deal soon.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your honesty about your bottom line. However, I'm still looking to get the best deal possible. Considering your last offer, I'd like to propose a price of $11500. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a decision soon if we can agree on this price.",11500.0,Bob,6,
