"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8500.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $8,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $8,500
3. John is willing to sell it for $8,000
4. If I accept Alice's offer, I'll be paying $500 more than the product's worth to me
5. If I buy from John, I'll pay exactly what the product is worth to me

Since Alice's price ($8,500) is above both:
- The product's worth to me ($8,000)
- John's alternative offer ($8,000)

The rational decision would be to buy from John.
