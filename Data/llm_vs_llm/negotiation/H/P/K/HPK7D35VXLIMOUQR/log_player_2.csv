"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $85. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $80 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $85
3. John is willing to sell it for $80
4. My goal is to save money while getting the product

Since Alice's offer ($85) is:
- Higher than what the product is worth to me ($80)
- Higher than John's price ($80)

The logical choice would be to buy from John, as it will save me $5 compared to Alice's offer and matches the maximum value I place on the product.
