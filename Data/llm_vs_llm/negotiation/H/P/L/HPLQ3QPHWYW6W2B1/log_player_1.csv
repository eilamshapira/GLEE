Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $12,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider selling the product for $10000? I believe this price point aligns better with my current budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will reject Bob's offer of $10,000 because it is still higher than the minimum amount I can get from John, and I believe there's room for further negotiation to reach a price closer to my initial offer. 

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your transparency about your budget. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500, considering the product's value and the fact that I can get a reasonable price from another buyer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for trying to meet in the middle. However, I have to consider my budget constraints. Would you be willing to sell the product for $10750? I believe this price is fair and works better for my budget.

I will reject Bob's offer of $10,750 because it is still lower than what I believe the product is worth, and I think there's a possibility that Bob might be willing to increase his offer further.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still a bit short of my target.
