"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the product, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your position, $10000 is below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $14000, considering your interest in the product. Let me know if this works for you.",14000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're interested but we're still a bit apart on price. How about we meet in the middle at $13000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find the product's value exceeds this amount.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13000 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11500?  This would be a fair price for both of us and I think you'll find it's a good deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11500 is still below what I'm looking for. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. How about $12500? This is just above my minimum and I believe it reflects the value of the product well.",12500.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $12250.  How about we settle on $12000? This would be a great price for both of us and allow us to finalize this deal. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,6,
