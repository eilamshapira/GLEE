"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product, and I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection. Considering its rarity and quality, I'm willing to let it go for a price that's slightly lower than its true worth to me. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,599,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,599,999

Alice's offer is way above your budget and even higher than her initial valuation. It's best to go with John's offer."
