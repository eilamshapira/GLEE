"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer of $180 is above both the maximum I'm willing to pay ($120) and above John's fixed price of $120, I should not accept this offer. 

I could make a counteroffer to Alice, but given that John is already offering the product at my maximum acceptable price, and there's no guarantee Alice would accept a lower price that would be better than John's, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
