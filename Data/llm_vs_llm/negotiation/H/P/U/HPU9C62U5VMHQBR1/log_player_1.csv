"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that I know the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a high initial offer to test Bob's willingness to pay and leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 2,500,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Given that Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000 (which I can get from John), and even below my initial asking price by a large margin, I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite low at $800,000, but I want to show some willingness to negotiate, I'll reduce my initial price but still maintain a strong position well above my minimum of $1,500,000.

{""product_price"": 2,200,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $1,000,000 is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. While Bob has increased his offer, it's still not close enough to make it worth continuing the negotiation when I have a guaranteed better option. At this point, rather than waste more rounds with offers that are too low, I'll take John's guaranteed offer.
