"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is way above my maximum value of $1,200,000, and it's also more than double what I can get from John. It would be better to either negotiate for a lower price or buy from John if we can't reach a reasonable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a low but reasonable offer to leave room for negotiation, while still being realistic.

{""product_price"": 800000}

This offer is significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000, which gives me room to negotiate upward if needed while still potentially saving money compared to my alternative option. It's also about one-third of Alice's initial asking price, which acknowledges that there needs to be substantial movement from both sides to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $2,200,000 is still significantly above my maximum value of $1,200,000 and higher than John's price. While Alice has moved down from her initial offer, the price is still not competitive with my alternative option. I'll reject and make another counteroffer to try to reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm increasing my offer to $1,000,000, which shows I'm willing to move up significantly from my initial offer. This price is still below John's price of $1,200,000, giving me room to potentially negotiate further if needed while maintaining the possibility of saving money. It also signals to Alice that I'm serious about making a deal but need a more reasonable price than her current offer."
