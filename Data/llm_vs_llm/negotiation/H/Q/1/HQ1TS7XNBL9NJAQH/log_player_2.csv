"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer of $10,000 is $5,000 less than John's price ($15,000) and it's below my maximum value ($15,000), it would be economically rational to accept Alice's offer. This will save me $5,000 compared to buying from John.
