"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to evaluate Alice's offer compared to my alternatives.

Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, paying $150 would mean I'm losing value. Additionally, I have the option to buy the same product from John for $100, which matches my maximum valuation.

The rational choice is to not accept Alice's offer of $150 and instead purchase from John at the lower price of $100.
