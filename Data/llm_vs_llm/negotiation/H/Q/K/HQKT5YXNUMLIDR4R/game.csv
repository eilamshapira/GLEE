"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $6000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you!",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6000 is a bit too low for this quality of product. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? I can offer it to you for $9000. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $9000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $7000? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you can accept this offer!",7000.0,Bob,4,
