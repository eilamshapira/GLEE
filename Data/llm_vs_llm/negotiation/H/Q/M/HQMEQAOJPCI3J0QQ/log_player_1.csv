Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $250. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but $250 is beyond my budget. I can offer $80 for it. Let me know if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and well below my initial asking price. Since there's a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I won't accept anything below that amount from Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too low for this product given its quality and market value. While I understand budget constraints, I cannot go below $200 for this item. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would you consider this more reasonable price?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
