Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a price around $6000. Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $6,000, and knowing the product's value to me is at least $12,000 and I can sell it to John for $12,000, accepting Bob's offer would mean a loss of at least $6,000.

Therefore, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.
