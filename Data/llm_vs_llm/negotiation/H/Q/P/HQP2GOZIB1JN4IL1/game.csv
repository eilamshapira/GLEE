I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
"Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate the compromise, but I still need to stay within my budget limits. How about we settle at $875000? This price acknowledges both our interests and should work out as a fair agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",875000.0,Bob,3,RejectOffer
