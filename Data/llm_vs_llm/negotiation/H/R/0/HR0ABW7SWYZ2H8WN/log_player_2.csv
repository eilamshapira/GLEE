"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my maximum valuation of $1,200,000. It would not be rational to accept this offer as it would result in a loss. I also have John's offer of $1,200,000 as a backup, but I'll first try to negotiate with Alice to see if I can get a better price. Given this is only round 1, I have plenty of opportunities to negotiate or fall back on John's offer later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

Reasoning: I'll start with a relatively low offer of $1,000,000 for several reasons:
1. This leaves room for negotiation upward while still staying below my maximum price of $1,200,000
2. Since Alice's product is worth $1,500,000 to her, she still has potential profit margin even at this price
3. Even if Alice rejects this offer (which is likely), it sets an anchor point for further negotiations
4. I still have John's offer of $1,200,000 as a backup, so I can afford to be aggressive in my initial negotiation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: Alice only reduced her price by $50,000 from her initial offer of $1,600,000 to $1,550,000, which is still well above my maximum value of $1,200,000. While she's showing some willingness to negotiate, this price would still result in a significant loss for me. Since we still have several rounds left and I always have John's offer of $1,200,000 as a backup, I'll continue negotiating with Alice to try to reach a more favorable price. In the next round, I'll make another counteroffer that's higher than my initial $1,000,000 to show good faith in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1100000}

Reasoning: I'll increase my offer to $1,100,000 for these reasons:
1. It shows willingness to move up from my initial offer of $1,000,000, demonstrating that I'm negotiating in good faith
2. The price is still comfortably below my maximum value of $1,200,000, leaving room for further negotiation
3. At $1,100,000, Alice would still make a profit since her value is $1,500,000
4. By making incremental increases, I'm trying to signal that I'm serious about reaching a deal but won't go above a certain point
5. I still have John's offer as a backup at $1,200,000, so I can continue to negotiate strategically

If Alice rejects this offer, I might consider one more increase before seriously considering taking John's offer."
