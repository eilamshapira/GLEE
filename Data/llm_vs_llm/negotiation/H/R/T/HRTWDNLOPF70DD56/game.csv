"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $100. This is a fair price considering the product's worth, and it allows you a nice margin if you decide to purchase it.",100.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your perspective, but I was hoping to spend less on this product. How about I offer you $60? This way, I can better justify the purchase, and you still make a profit.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $60 as I have other interested buyers. I need to get at least $80 for this product. However, I know you're looking for a good deal, so I can come down to $90. This is still a great value considering the product is worth $120 to you, giving you a $30 profit margin.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Let's meet in the middle. How about I offer you $75? This price ensures that we both make a profit.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I must be transparent with you. I have another buyer, John, who is ready to pay $80 for the product. Given this situation, I cannot accept less than $85 for the product. This still gives you a significant profit of $35 based on the product's value to you. I hope we can make this deal work.",85.0,Alice,5,

"I see, Alice. Thank you for being transparent with me. Given the new information, I'm ready to offer $80 for the product. This price matches the other offer you have and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate that you're willing to match John's offer at $80. However, since I have two interested buyers, I'm in a position to consider the best offer. Given that the product is worth $120 to you, providing a $40 profit margin at $80, I'm asking for $85. This is just a small increase that still leaves you with a substantial profit of $35. If we can agree on this price, we can close the deal immediately.",85.0,Alice,7,
