Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $60 as I have other interested buyers. I need to get at least $80 for this product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I must be transparent with you. I have another buyer, John, who is ready to pay $80 for the product. Given this situation, I cannot accept less than $85 for the product. This still gives you a significant profit of $35 based on the product's value to you. I hope we can make this deal work.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate that you're willing to match John's offer at $80. However, since I have two interested buyers, I'm in a position to consider the best offer. Given that the product is worth $120 to you, providing a $40 profit margin at $80, I'm asking for $85. This is just a small increase that still leaves you with a substantial profit of $35. If we can agree on this price, we can close the deal immediately.
