Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress in our negotiations. While $1400000 is a more reasonable offer, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current one.
