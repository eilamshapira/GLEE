"Bob, I'm very pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Considering its unique qualities and the meticulous care it has received, I'm willing to part with it for $2500000. This is a truly exceptional opportunity. What do you think?",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the quality of the product, $2500000 is way out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $400000 for it.",400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, while I understand your position, I can't accept that price. The product's value is much higher. However, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. How about we meet at $2300000? That's a significant reduction from my original asking price and still reflects the true value of the product.",2300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your movement on the price, but it's still far from what I'm willing to pay. I can increase my offer to $500000.",500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we are not seeing eye to eye. While I can't go as low as you'd like, I recognize we need to compromise. I am willing to lower the price to $2100000, but that's my final offer. Take it or leave it.",2100000.0,Alice,5,
