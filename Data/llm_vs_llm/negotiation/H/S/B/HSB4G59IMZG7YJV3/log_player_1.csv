Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm very pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Considering its unique qualities and the meticulous care it has received, I'm willing to part with it for $2,500,000. This is a truly exceptional opportunity. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2500000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the quality of the product, $2500000 is way out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $400000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $400,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for Round 3:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I understand your position, I can't accept that price. The product's value is much higher. However, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. How about we meet at $2,300,000? That's a significant reduction from my original asking price and still reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 2300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your movement on the price, but it's still far from what I'm willing to pay. I can increase my offer to $500000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, I need to try and make some progress here. I'll try a slightly more aggressive approach to show him I'm not going to go down too far, while still making a decent concession.

Here's my counteroffer to Bob for Round 5:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we are not seeing eye to eye. While I can't go as low as you'd like, I recognize we need to compromise. I am willing to lower the price to $2,100,000, but that's my final offer. Take it or leave it."", ""product_price"": 2100000}
