Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, while I understand your position, I can't accept that price. The product's value is much higher. However, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we are not seeing eye to eye. While I can't go as low as you'd like, I recognize we need to compromise. I am willing to lower the price to $2100000, but that's my final offer. Take it or leave it.

Alice, I'm afraid we're too far apart on the price. I can't accept your offer, and I don't think we'll be able to reach an agreement. I've decided to buy the product from John."
