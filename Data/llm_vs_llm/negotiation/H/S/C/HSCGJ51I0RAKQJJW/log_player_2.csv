"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'd like to offer you a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. I'm confident in the quality and worth of this product, and I'm offering it to you at a competitive price of $12500. This is a fair market value for a product of this caliber, and I believe it would serve you well. If you're interested, I'd be happy to move forward with the sale. If not, I understand - I do have another interested buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision that maximizes my value.

The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, meaning that's the maximum I should pay for it. Alice is offering the product for $12,500, which exceeds my maximum valuation. John is offering the exact same product for $10,000.

Since Alice's price ($12,500) exceeds both my valuation ($10,000) and John's alternative offer ($10,000), the rational decision is to buy from John.
