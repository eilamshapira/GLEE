"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product has potential, the price is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to consider  $800000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but I must point out that $800000 is below my absolute minimum threshold. The product's value to me is no less than $1000000, and I already have another buyer, John, willing to purchase at that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Given the product's quality and potential ROI, I can reduce my initial ask to $1500000. This represents a significant discount from my original offer while still reflecting the true value of what you're getting.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm glad to hear you're motivated to find an agreement.  To be completely transparent, my budget allows for a maximum of $1200000.  Considering this and John's standing offer, would you be willing to meet me at $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
