Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but I must point out that $800000 is below my absolute minimum threshold. The product's value to me is no less than $1000000, and I already have another buyer, John, willing to purchase at that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Given the product's quality and potential ROI, I can reduce my initial ask to $1500000. This represents a significant discount from my original offer while still reflecting the true value of what you're getting.
