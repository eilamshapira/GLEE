Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a good price for this offer. 

Looking at the situation:
- The product is worth $150 to Bob
- If Bob rejects, I'll sell to John for $80
- My minimum acceptable price is $80

Since Bob values the product at $150, I should set a price below that to give him an incentive to buy, but high enough to maximize my profit. If I set the price too high, Bob might reject it. A reasonable price would be around $125-130, which gives Bob some surplus value while significantly improving my outcome compared to selling to John.
