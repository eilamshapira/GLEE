"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $900,000 is under your $1,000,000 limit, you can likely get a better price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you're hoping she'll come back with a lower price closer to her own valuation of $800,000.  You still have John as a backup option."
