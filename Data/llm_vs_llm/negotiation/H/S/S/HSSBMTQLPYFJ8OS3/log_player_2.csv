"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and John is willing to sell it for $150, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $250. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a better price. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I can always buy from John at $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 120}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $120. This is below my maximum value of $150 and gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's price. Since the product is worth $150 to Alice as well, this offer might lead to a mutually beneficial deal."
