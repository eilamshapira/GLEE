"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand $110 may have seemed high, I need to consider my costs as well. I can come down to $105, which is still a good value for this product. Would that work for you?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. I've considered your offer of $95, and I can come down to $100. This is really the best I can do considering the value of the product. I believe this is a fair middle ground between our positions.",100.0,Alice,5,
