"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a unique product that I'm excited to offer you. I'm asking for $12000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Based on the information provided, I'll analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $12,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: $12,000

Since Alice's offer is $12,000, which is exactly the same as John's price, and it's also the maximum amount the product is worth to you, there's no financial advantage to choosing one seller over the other. 

Given that both options cost the same amount, I'll accept Alice's offer since she's already presenting the product to you, and there's no reason to go through the additional step of rejecting and going to John.
