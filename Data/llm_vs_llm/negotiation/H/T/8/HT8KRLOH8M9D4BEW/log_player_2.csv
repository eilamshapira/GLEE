"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Alice's offer: $14,999
2. John's price: $15,000
3. My maximum value: $15,000

Alice's offer is only $1 cheaper than John's price, and both are very close to my maximum value of $15,000. While Alice's offer is technically better than John's price, the difference is minimal, and there might be room for negotiation with Alice since the product is worth $10,000 to her.

By rejecting Alice's offer, I can signal that her price is too high and potentially get a better deal in future negotiations, considering she has a significant profit margin ($14,999 - $10,000 = $4,999).
