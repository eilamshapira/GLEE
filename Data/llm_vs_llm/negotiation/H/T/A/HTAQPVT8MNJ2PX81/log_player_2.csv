"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer ($2,000,000) is higher than both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's price ($1,500,000), I will reject this offer. In the next round, I can make a counteroffer that's more reasonable and below my maximum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer significantly below my maximum value to leave room for negotiation while still being reasonable:

{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm offering $1,000,000, which is substantially lower than both Alice's initial offer and John's price. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to John's price of $1,500,000. If Alice rejects this, we can still work our way up to a mutually acceptable price, or I always have the option to go with John's offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,800,000 is still above both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's price ($1,500,000). While Alice has moved down from her initial offer, it's still not competitive with John's price. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to reach a price below $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still stay well below John's price to maintain room for negotiation:

{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'm offering $1,200,000, which is a $200,000 increase from my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate upward while still maintaining a significant potential savings compared to John's price of $1,500,000. This gives Alice room to counter while keeping the price in a range that would be beneficial for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($1,600,000) is still above John's price ($1,500,000)
2. While Alice has been coming down in price, the rate of decrease suggests we might not get below John's price
3. We've already used half of our available rounds
4. John's price is already at my maximum value ($1,500,000)
5. There's no guarantee that continuing negotiation with Alice will result in a better deal than John's

It's better to secure the deal with John at $1,500,000 rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome."
