"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer of $200 is higher than both my maximum value ($150) and John's price ($150), it wouldn't be rational to accept this offer. Between the remaining options, I could try negotiating with Alice by making a counteroffer, but since John's price ($150) exactly matches my maximum value, and there's no guarantee Alice would go below this price, the safest option is to buy from John.
