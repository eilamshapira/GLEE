"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","The current offer of $14,500 is within my budget of $15,000. Buying from John would cost $15,000, so accepting Alice's offer is better than buying from John. Therefore, I should accept.
