"Alice's offer: The product price will be $121. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $121
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $80 to me
2. Alice's offer is $121
3. John is offering the same product for $80

The logical choice is to buy from John since:
- Alice's price ($121) is significantly higher than my maximum valuation ($80)
- John's price ($80) matches my maximum valuation
- I would lose $41 by accepting Alice's offer compared to buying from John
