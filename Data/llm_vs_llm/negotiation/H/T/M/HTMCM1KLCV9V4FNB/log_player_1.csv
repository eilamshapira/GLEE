Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $85 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($80), but lower than what I initially hoped for, I'll choose to reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

My counteroffer is: $95

So, my decision is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} and I'll wait for Bob's response to my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 95}"
