"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer of $100 is equal to John's price and the product is worth $80 to Alice, I can try to negotiate a better price with Alice by making a counteroffer. There's no risk in rejecting this offer since I can always fall back to John's $100 price later if negotiations with Alice don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 85}

I'm offering $85, which is slightly above Alice's cost of $80. This gives Alice a small profit while still being significantly better than the $100 alternative for me. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation that leaves room for further adjustment if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $95. This is a reasonable compromise as it's $5 less than John's price of $100. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might not go lower, and I might end up having to pay $100 to John. The $95 price gives Alice a fair profit margin above her $80 cost while saving me $5 compared to my alternative option."
