"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have carefully considered the value of this product and I am offering it to you at $1550000. This is a competitive price given the product's quality and market value. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,550,000 is higher than my maximum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, I should reject Alice's offer. But I can directly choose to buy from John.
