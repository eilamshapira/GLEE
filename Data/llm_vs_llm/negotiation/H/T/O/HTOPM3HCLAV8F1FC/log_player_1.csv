"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $20,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, based on my budget and the market rates, I'm looking to spend closer to $7500. I'd be willing to purchase the product at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $7,500 is significantly lower than the product's value to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate and try to reach a better price. Selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed option, but I want to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $7,500 is below my expectations. Considering the product's value and market demand, I'm willing to make a concession and offer it to you for $18,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still have budget constraints to consider. I can increase my offer to $8500. I'd be happy to finalize the purchase at this price.

Bob's new offer of $8,500 is still significantly lower than the product's value to me. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer. I have 6 rounds left to negotiate, and I'm willing to continue exploring the possibility of getting a better price from Bob. Selling to John for $12,000 remains a viable option, but I'm not ready to settle for that price yet, as I believe I can get a higher price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $16,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob's new offer of $9,000 is still lower than what I'm willing to accept. Considering the product's value to me, I believe I can get a better price. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer. However, I'm starting to consider the option of selling to John for $12,000, as the negotiations with Bob are not progressing as quickly as I had hoped.
