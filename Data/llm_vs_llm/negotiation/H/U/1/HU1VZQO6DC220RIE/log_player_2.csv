"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer of $150 is higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120), it wouldn't be rational to accept her offer. John's price is the same as my maximum value, and I'm guaranteed to get the product from him.
