Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","$9,000 is too low considering the product's value to Bob ($15,000). I have 8 more rounds to negotiate, and the difference between Bob's offer ($9,000) and John's guaranteed offer ($8,000) is only $1,000. I believe I can get a better price from Bob.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $10,000 is better than John's $8,000, there's still significant room between this offer and the product's value to Bob ($15,000). With 6 rounds remaining, I'll continue negotiating.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll reduce my previous offer to show flexibility while still maintaining a good profit margin. I'll split the difference between my last offer ($12,000) and Bob's last offer ($10,000), while keeping it closer to my side.

The gap between Bob's current offer and the product's value to him ($15,000) suggests there's still room for negotiation.
