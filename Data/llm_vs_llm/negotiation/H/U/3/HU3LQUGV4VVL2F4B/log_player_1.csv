Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Okay, considering my minimum acceptable price is $800,000, Bob's offer of $900,000 is definitely better than selling to John.

Therefore, my decision is:

```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```"
