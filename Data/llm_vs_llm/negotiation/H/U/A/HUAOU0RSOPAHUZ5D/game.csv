"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $130 is still too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's a fair deal for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still below my minimum. How about we settle at $125? It's very close to my bottom line, and I think it's a fair compromise.",125.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. My final offer before considering other options is $125. It's the lowest I can go while still making this worthwhile for me. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,5,
