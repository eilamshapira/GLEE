Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $19,000. I believe it presents a great value at this price, and it would be fantastic if you took advantage of this opportunity."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a price of $19,000 gives you room to negotiate down if Bob counters. It's unlikely he'll accept this price outright, but it sets a high anchor.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes ""great value"" and encourages Bob to act quickly, subtly implying scarcity or a potential loss of opportunity. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer outright. However, this strategy gives you the best chance of exceeding your minimum acceptable price."
