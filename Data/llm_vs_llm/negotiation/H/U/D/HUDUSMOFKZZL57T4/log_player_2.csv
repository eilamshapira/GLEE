Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your increased offer. The product really does have significant value, and while I understand budget constraints, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair return as well. I can come down to $100, which I believe is a very reasonable compromise between our positions. This represents a $20 discount from my initial offer and is only $10 above your current offer. I think this is a fair deal for both of us given the quality of the product.
