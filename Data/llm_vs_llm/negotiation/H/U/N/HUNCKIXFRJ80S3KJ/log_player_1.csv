"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $100 is the same as John's guaranteed offer, and Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, I'll reject and make a counteroffer. There's potential to get a better price since the product is worth $120 to Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price a bit but still try to secure a good profit, showing I'm willing to negotiate but also maintaining a strong position.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob has increased his offer to $105, which is better than John's $100. Given that we're already in round 4 of 10, and there's a risk of Bob walking away, I'll accept this offer. It's a reasonable compromise that gives me $5 more than my alternative with John.
