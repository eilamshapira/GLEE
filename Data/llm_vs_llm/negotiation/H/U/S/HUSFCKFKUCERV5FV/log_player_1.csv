{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. Considering its value and unique features, I'm offering it to you for $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but I feel the price is a bit high. How about I purchase the product for $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:
