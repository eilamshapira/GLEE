"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I'm confident it will meet your needs and provide great value. The price for the product is $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. Since there are still 9 rounds left for negotiation, I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better price from Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,200,000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $600,000, which I believe is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but given the product's high value and market potential, I am willing to sell it for $1000000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her price by $200,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still above both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000). Given that John's offer is better, I could take his offer now. However, since there are still 7 rounds left, I'll reject Alice's offer and try one more time to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that moves closer to Alice's price but still stays below John's price of $800,000.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I can increase my previous offer to $700,000, which is a significant step up. This reflects the maximum value I can justify for this purchase given my constraints."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
