"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product, and I believe it will bring significant value to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. I look forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Looking at the situation:

- The product is worth up to $15,000 to me
- Alice offers to sell it for $14,000
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $15,000

Since Alice's price ($14,000) is less than both:
1) The maximum value of the product to me ($15,000)
2) John's alternative price ($15,000)

It makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer and save $1,000 compared to buying from John.
