"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe will be highly valuable to you. My asking price is $1800000, reflecting its true worth and potential.

"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but the price is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, considering my financial constraints and the market value I've assessed. Let me know if this works for you or if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it still presents a valuable opportunity for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $1400000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $900000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value I can derive from the product. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $900000 is still significantly lower than what I need to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000,  which is a fair compromise for both of us. This price reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your budget concerns.  Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your latest offer, but $1250000 is still beyond what I can justify spending. I'm willing to go up to $950000, which I believe is a strong offer considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
