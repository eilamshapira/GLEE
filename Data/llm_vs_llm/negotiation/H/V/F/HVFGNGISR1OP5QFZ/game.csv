"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1500000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000, which I believe is a fair starting point for negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is too low. As I mentioned, the product's inherent value to me is $1200000. However, I am willing to be flexible to reach an agreement. Let's meet in the middle a bit. How about $1400000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1400000 is still above what I can justify. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $1100000, which I believe reflects a fair compromise given the value we both see in the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. While $1100000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1200000, I see we're both serious about reaching a deal. I'll come down a bit further. How about $1300000? This is a substantial move on my part.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your effort to come down to $1300000. I'm also keen to close this deal. Let's meet closer to the middle. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1150000. This should be a good step towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're very close. $1150000 is still a bit short of my bottom line. I'm willing to make one final offer to you. How about $1250000? This is the lowest I can go.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
