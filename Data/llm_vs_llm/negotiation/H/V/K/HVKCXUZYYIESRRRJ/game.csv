"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need a more reasonable price. I'm offering $1200000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the value of this product far exceeds $1200000. To demonstrate my willingness to negotiate, I'll reduce the price. However, I can't go too low. How about $2200000?",2200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price, but $2200000 is still beyond what I'm willing to pay. I'm serious about purchasing the product and willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. I'm offering $1700000, but I'm hoping we can do better than that. How about we meet at $1400000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you are serious about the product. While I value your interest, your last offer remains significantly below its worth. However, to move things forward, and showing good faith, I'm willing to meet you closer to your offer. Let's settle on $2000000. This is my final offer. What do you say?",2000000.0,Alice,5,
