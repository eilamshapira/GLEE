"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering.  It makes sense to reject her offer and see if she'll come down."
