"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me. I'll see if Bob is willing to negotiate from this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get more.  I'll counter with a lower price, but still higher than his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows flexibility while still ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, this is a good deal for me. It's above my minimum and the negotiations are getting more time-consuming. I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely and having to sell to John at a lower price."
