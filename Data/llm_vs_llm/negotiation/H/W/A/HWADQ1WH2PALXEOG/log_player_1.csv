Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 100}

Reasoning: Since I know that:
1. The product is worth $80 to Bob
2. I can definitely sell it to John for $100
3. The product is worth no less than $100 to me

It makes the most sense to offer it to Bob for $100. Even though this price is above Bob's valuation of $80, and he will likely reject it, this is the optimal strategy because:
- If Bob accepts (unlikely), I get $100
- When Bob rejects (likely), I can sell to John for $100

There's no incentive for me to offer a lower price since I have a guaranteed buyer at $100."
