"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, as I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. I'm also aware that Bob might not be willing to pay this much, so I'm prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more. I'll counter-offer and see if Bob is willing to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering the price to $1,250,000, which is still significantly more than my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in my product and meet me halfway."
