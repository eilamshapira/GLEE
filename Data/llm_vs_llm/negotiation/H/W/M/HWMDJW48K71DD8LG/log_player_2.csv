Alice's offer is way too high. It makes more sense to try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a significantly lower price, a million dollars. This is a strong opening move to gauge her willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000,000

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's a significant reduction, I'm still better off trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 2500000} 
```

I'm going to split the difference between my last offer and Alice's current offer. This shows I'm serious about a deal but still believe the price is too high."
