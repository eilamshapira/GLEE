"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Looking at the options:

1. Alice is offering the product for $12,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John for $15,000

Since Alice's offer ($12,000) is less than John's price ($15,000) and below my maximum value of $15,000, I should accept Alice's offer to save $3,000.
