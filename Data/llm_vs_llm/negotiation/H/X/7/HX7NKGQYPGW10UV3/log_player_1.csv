Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer to Bob that's closer to his valuation of $120 but leaves some room for negotiation if needed.

{""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $90 is higher than John's $80, and there's still room for negotiation, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer. I believe we can reach a better price point between $90 and $120.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial $110, but still aim for a better price than Bob's $90 offer.
