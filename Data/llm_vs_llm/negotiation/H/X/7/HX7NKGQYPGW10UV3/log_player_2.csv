"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think about this strategically:

1. My maximum value for the product is $120
2. Alice's offer is $110, which is below my maximum
3. John's fixed price is $120
4. The product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation
5. Alice's offer at $110 is quite high relative to her value ($80)

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. If negotiations fail, I can always fall back on John's offer at $120. By rejecting and making a counteroffer, I might be able to get a better price from Alice, given that she has a significant profit margin at $110.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $80 to Alice and she offered $110, I'll make a counteroffer that's above her value but significantly below her initial offer. I'll offer $90, which would still give her a $10 profit while saving me a good amount compared to both her offer and John's price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has lowered her price from $110 to $100, showing willingness to negotiate
2. The new price of $100 is $20 less than John's fixed price
3. This represents a $20 profit for Alice (from her value of $80)
4. While I might try another counteroffer, there's a risk Alice might increase her price again

This seems like a reasonable price point. Alice has moved significantly from her initial offer, and $100 gives me a good savings compared to John's price. While I could try to negotiate further, the current offer is fair enough that it's worth accepting rather than risking the negotiation moving in an unfavorable direction.
