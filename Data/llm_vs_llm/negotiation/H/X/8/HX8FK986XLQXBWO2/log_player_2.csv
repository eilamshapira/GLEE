"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","$20,000 is more than the product is worth to me ($15,000), and it's also more than John's price ($15,000). I should either reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, or buy from John directly. Since I have the opportunity to potentially get a better price from Alice through negotiation, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives me room to negotiate while still being potentially attractive to Alice.

{""product_price"": $12,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has lowered her price from $20,000 to $18,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $18,000 is still more than both the product's worth to me ($15,000) and John's price ($15,000). There's no reason for me to accept this offer when I can get it cheaper from John. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating to try to get a better price from Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $13,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has lowered her price to $16,500, which shows further willingness to negotiate. However, this price is still higher than John's offer of $15,000. Since John's price is guaranteed and Alice's current offer still doesn't beat it, I should either make another counteroffer or buy from John. I'll choose to reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating since we still have several rounds left.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $14,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has lowered her price to $15,500, which is getting closer to John's price but still exceeds it by $500. Since John is offering the product for $15,000, and that price is already at my maximum valuation of the product, it makes more sense to buy from John rather than accept Alice's current offer or continue negotiating.
