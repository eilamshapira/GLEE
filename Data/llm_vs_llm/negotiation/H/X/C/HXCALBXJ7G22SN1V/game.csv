"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm very interested in the product, $140 is a bit steep. Given market conditions, I think $100 would be a fair price for this product. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to make a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $130. This price still gives you a great value while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $130 is better, I think we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. I can offer $115, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and would provide you with a healthy profit margin. Would this work for you?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. I'm willing to compromise further, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. This price is closer to your offer while still allowing me to make a decent profit. Let me know if this works for you.",125.0,Alice,5,
