Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm very interested in the product, $140 is a bit steep. Given market conditions, I think $100 would be a fair price for this product. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $130 is better, I think we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.
