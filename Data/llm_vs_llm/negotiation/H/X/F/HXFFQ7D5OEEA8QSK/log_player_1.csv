Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer Bob. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me (and I can definitely sell it to John for $80 if Bob rejects), I want to offer a price that maximizes my expected revenue.

Without knowing Bob's value for the product, I'll need to make a reasonable offer that has a good chance of being accepted while still giving me a good profit. If I price too high, Bob might reject it, and I'll only get $80 from John. If I price too low, I might leave money on the table.

I'll offer a moderately higher price than my minimum acceptable value:

{""product_price"": 120}"
