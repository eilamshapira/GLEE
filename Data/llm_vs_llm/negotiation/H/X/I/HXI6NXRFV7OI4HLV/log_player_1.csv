Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my strategy carefully. The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed backup buyer (John) at that price. Bob values the product at only $800,000, which creates a challenging situation since there's no price point where both of us can profit.

Given this information, I'll make an initial offer to Bob, understanding that he likely won't accept it, but it establishes a starting point for potential negotiation.
