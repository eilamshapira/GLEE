"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","The offer Alice is making is for $130, which is more than what the product is worth to me (maximum $100). Additionally, it's also more than what John is offering ($100).

Since I can buy the product from John for $100, it doesn't make sense to accept Alice's offer of $130. I should either make a counteroffer to see if Alice will come down to a price below $100, or simply buy from John.

Given that I have the option to buy from John at any time, I'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price first.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice that's reasonable but still gives me some savings compared to John's price.

{""product_price"": $80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has reduced her price from $130 to $125, but this is still higher than both:
1) What the product is worth to me (max $100)
2) John's offer of $100

Since I can get the same product from John for $100, there's no reason to accept Alice's $125 offer. I'll reject and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly, but still keep it below John's price to ensure I save money.

{""product_price"": $85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has now lowered her price to $120, which is still higher than John's price of $100. Since the product is only worth up to $100 to me, and I can buy it from John for $100, I have no reason to accept Alice's current offer of $120.

I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer to see if Alice will come down below $100.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer a bit more, making it more attractive to Alice while still keeping it below John's price.
