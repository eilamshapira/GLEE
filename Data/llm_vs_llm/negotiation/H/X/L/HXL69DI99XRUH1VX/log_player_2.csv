You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is within my budget, it's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price. There's a good chance Alice is starting high, hoping I'll accept the first offer. I have plenty of room to counter-offer below my $1,200,000 maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is coming down, but $850,000 is still quite a gap from my initial counteroffer. It suggests there's more room for negotiation.  I'll reject and propose a counteroffer closer to a potential midpoint."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating in smaller increments now, which suggests we're getting closer to a price she might accept. However, $825,000 is still above a comfortable target for me. I'll reject and propose a counteroffer to see if I can nudge the price down a bit further."
