Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a price that maximizes my profit while considering that Bob values the product at $15,000. If I set the price too high, Bob might reject it, and I'll have to sell to John for $10,000. If I set it too low, I'll lose potential profit.

Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, he would rationally accept any price up to that amount. However, if I price it at exactly $15,000, he might be indifferent between accepting and rejecting since he gains no surplus.

To ensure Bob accepts, I should offer slightly below $15,000, giving him a small incentive while maximizing my profit. Since my alternative is selling to John for $10,000, any price above that which Bob accepts is profitable for me.
