"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Alice's offer: $14,800
2. John's price: $15,000
3. My maximum value: $15,000

Alice's offer is slightly lower than John's price ($200 less). While it's close to my maximum value, it still saves me money compared to buying from John. Since there's no indication that I can negotiate with Alice for a better price, and I need the product, I should accept Alice's offer to save $200.
