"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something you value at $120, and I'm willing to let it go for $110.  This is a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'm rejecting the offer because I'm hoping Alice will lower the price further since it's worth $100 to her, and I want to save as much money as possible. I can always buy from John for $120 if the negotiation doesn't go in my favor."
