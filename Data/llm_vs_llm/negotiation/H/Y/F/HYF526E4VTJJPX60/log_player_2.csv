"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","The current offer from Alice is $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my maximum willingness to pay of $800,000. I also have the option to buy the same product from John for $800,000. Therefore, accepting Alice's offer would be a poor decision. I should buy the product from Jhon.
