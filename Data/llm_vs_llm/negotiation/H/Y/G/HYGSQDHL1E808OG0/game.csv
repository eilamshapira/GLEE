,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. I believe this is a fair price, considering I can also purchase it from John for $8000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $6000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $14000. This price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $14000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to propose $10000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
