"Hi Bob, I considered your offer and I'm willing to lower the price to $175 for a quick sale.  Are you willing to match this new price?",175.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. While $175 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $100? That would be a great deal for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
