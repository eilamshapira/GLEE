"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I need to consider my position carefully. The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at this price. Bob values it at only $800,000, which creates a challenging negotiation as there's no overlap in our valuation ranges.

Since I have the alternative option with John, I'll start with a price close to my reservation value.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I see that Bob has offered his maximum valuation of $800,000, which indicates he likely won't go much higher. However, this is still significantly below my reservation value of $1,500,000, and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price.

Given the substantial gap between our valuations and my strong BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement), I'll make a lower counteroffer but still maintain a price that would be acceptable to me.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I notice Bob has increased his offer to $900,000, which shows some flexibility on his part. However, this is still substantially below my reservation value of $1,500,000, and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price.

Since Bob has moved $100,000 from his initial position, I'll show some movement as well, but still remain well above his current offer given my strong alternative.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I see Bob is continuing to increase his offers, now at $950,000. This shows he's willing to pay more than his stated valuation of $800,000, which is interesting. However, this is still significantly below my reservation value and John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000.

Since we're now in round 7 of 10, I'll make a more substantial concession to see if we can bridge the gap, while still maintaining a price that would be preferable to my alternative with John.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I notice Bob has now offered $1,000,000, which is $200,000 above his initial valuation. This shows significant movement on his part, but it's still well below my reservation value of $1,500,000.

We're now in round 9 of 10, so time is running short. I'll make one more substantial concession to see if we can reach an agreement, though I'm still mindful of my guaranteed alternative with John.
