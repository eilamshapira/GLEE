Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider the situation carefully. I'm selling a product that's worth $150 to Bob, but if he rejects my offer, I'm guaranteed to get $120 from John.

Bob would rationally accept any price below $150, as that would give him positive value. However, I should consider how Bob might perceive the fairness of my offer. If I offer the product at a price very close to $150, Bob might reject it even if it's technically rational for him to accept.

Given that my fallback option is $120, I want to set a price that's high enough to maximize my profit but not so high that Bob is likely to reject it. I'll offer the product at $135, which gives Bob $15 of value while giving me $15 more than my guaranteed alternative.
