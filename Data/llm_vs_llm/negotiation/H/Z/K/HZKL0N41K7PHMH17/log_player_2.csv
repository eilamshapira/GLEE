"Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's initial offer is $80, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and I also have the option to buy it from John for the same price, I don't see a need to proceed with negotiations that could potentially save me money. However, I also don't want to immediately accept the offer without trying to negotiate a better price. Therefore, my decision is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer, hoping to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer of $80, but still reasonable, considering I'm willing to pay up to $80. A good starting point could be to offer a price that is significantly lower than $80 to leave room for negotiation.
