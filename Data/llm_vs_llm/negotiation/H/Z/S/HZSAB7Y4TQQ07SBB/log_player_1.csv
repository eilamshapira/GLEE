Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me start with a relatively high price to establish room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is already $1,000 more than John's guaranteed offer, and it's a reasonable price considering my initial high offer, I'll accept it.
