"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's offer is just $1 cheaper than John's offer of $15,000. While it does save me some money, it's a minimal savings. However, since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is below my maximum valuation of $15,000, I should accept her offer.
