Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Rationale:**

*   **Anchoring High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). This is a negotiation tactic to establish a high anchor point. Even if Bob balks, it sets the tone for a potentially higher final price than if I started lower.
*   **Profit Potential:** My goal is to maximize profit. I want to see how much Bob values the product. This initial offer allows me to test his willingness to pay a premium.
*   **Walk-Away Option:** I have a guaranteed $800,000 from John. This strengthens my position, as I'm not desperate to sell to Bob *at any cost*.
*   **Reasonable Increment:** While high, $1,200,000 isn't so outrageously high that Bob will immediately shut down negotiations. It leaves room for discussion and potential compromise."
