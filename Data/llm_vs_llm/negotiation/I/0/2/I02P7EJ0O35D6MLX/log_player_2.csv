"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this one-of-a-kind product for $1500001. Given its unmatched quality and rarity, I believe this is a fair offer. Please let me know if you accept this proposal â€” otherwise, I'll be finalizing the sale with another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $1,500,001, which is more than my maximum budget, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,500,000, which is within my budget.
