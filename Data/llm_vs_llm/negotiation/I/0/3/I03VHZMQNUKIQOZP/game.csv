,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is significantly above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and needs, I would be willing to pay $5000 for the product. This is a serious offer that reflects my current budget constraints.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20000 may be out of your budget, but $5000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your budget constraints, I'm reducing my initial offer, but I still need to ensure I get a fair value for the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice. However, $15000 is still significantly above what I can justify spending. I've done extensive market research, and while I understand you're looking for fair value, I can increase my offer to $6500. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and reflects the maximum value I can offer while staying within my budget constraints.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $6500. I understand that you've done your market research, but I still believe the product's value is higher. I'm trying to be flexible and find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to reduce my previous offer further, but I need to ensure I get at least a certain value for the product. Let's try to meet in the middle.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued flexibility, Alice, and I understand you're trying to meet in the middle. However, I need to be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $8000, and that's actually the absolute maximum I can spend on this product. I'm still negotiating with you because I believe we might find a better deal for both of us. I can offer $7500, which is very close to my absolute maximum budget. This is a serious offer that's nearly 15% higher than my previous one.",7500.0,Bob,6,
