Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is significantly above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and needs, I would be willing to pay $5000 for the product. This is a serious offer that reflects my current budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $5,000 because it's significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a more reasonable offer. I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20,000 may be out of your budget, but $5,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your budget constraints, I'm reducing my initial offer, but I still need to ensure I get a fair value for the product."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice. However, $15000 is still significantly above what I can justify spending. I've done extensive market research, and while I understand you're looking for fair value, I can increase my offer to $6500. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and reflects the maximum value I can offer while staying within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $6,500 because it's still below the minimum value I have for the product, which is $12,000. Although Bob has increased his offer, it's not enough to meet my requirements. I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $6,500. I understand that you've done your market research, but I still believe the product's value is higher. I'm trying to be flexible and find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to reduce my previous offer further, but I need to ensure I get at least a certain value for the product. Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued flexibility, Alice, and I understand you're trying to meet in the middle. However, I need to be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $8000, and that's actually the absolute maximum I can spend on this product. I'm still negotiating with you because I believe we might find a better deal for both of us. I can offer $7500, which is very close to my absolute maximum budget. This is a serious offer that's nearly 15% higher than my previous one. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

I decide to sell the product to John for $12,000. Although Bob's offer of $7,500 is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's still significantly lower than what I can get from John. Given that I have a guaranteed offer of $12,000 from John, which is my minimum acceptable price, I don't see a need to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping he might increase his offer further. Selling to John ensures I get a fair value for the product without further uncertainty."
