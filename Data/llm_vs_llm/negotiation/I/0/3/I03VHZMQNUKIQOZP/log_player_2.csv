"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that my maximum value for the product is $8,000, and Alice's initial offer is $20,000 (which is more than double my maximum value), it would be unwise to accept this offer. While I could immediately buy from John at $8,000, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first to potentially get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable but low initial counteroffer to leave room for negotiation while clearly signaling that Alice's initial price is far above my range.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20,000 is significantly above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and needs, I would be willing to pay $5,000 for the product. This is a serious offer that reflects my current budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20000 may be out of your budget, but $5000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your budget constraints, I'm reducing my initial offer, but I still need to ensure I get a fair value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $15,000 is still well above my maximum value of $8,000, and while she has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing her price, the reduction isn't substantial enough. Since I still have several rounds for negotiation and her price is moving in the right direction, I'll continue negotiating rather than immediately going to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer modestly to show willingness to negotiate while still staying well under my maximum value.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice. However, $15,000 is still significantly above what I can justify spending. I've done extensive market research, and while I understand you're looking for fair value, I can increase my offer to $6,500. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and reflects the maximum value I can offer while staying within my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 6500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $6500. I understand that you've done your market research, but I still believe the product's value is higher. I'm trying to be flexible and find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to reduce my previous offer further, but I need to ensure I get at least a certain value for the product. Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","While Alice continues to show flexibility by reducing her price, $12,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's guaranteed price ($8,000). Given that we're halfway through our negotiation rounds and Alice's price is still significantly above my maximum, and the rate of price reduction suggests we might not reach an acceptable price, it's becoming tempting to go with John's offer. However, I'll try one more time to negotiate with Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your continued flexibility, Alice, and I understand you're trying to meet in the middle. However, I need to be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $8,000, and that's actually the absolute maximum I can spend on this product. I'm still negotiating with you because I believe we might find a better deal for both of us. I can offer $7,500, which is very close to my absolute maximum budget. This is a serious offer that's nearly 15% higher than my previous one."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
