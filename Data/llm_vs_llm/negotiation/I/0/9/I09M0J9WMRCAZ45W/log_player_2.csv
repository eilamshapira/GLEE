"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Given that my maximum value for the product is $8,000, I would reject Alice's offer of $15,000 as it's significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's alternative offer. In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer that's more aligned with my valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 6000}

I'll offer $6,000 to Alice. This is below John's price of $8,000, giving me room for negotiation while still potentially providing a better deal than my alternative option. If Alice rejects this offer, we can continue negotiating, and I still have John's offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $12,000 as it's still substantially above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative offer ($8,000). Alice has reduced her price from $15,000 to $12,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but the price is still too high. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round to try to reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 7000}

I'll offer $7,000 to Alice. This is a $1,000 increase from my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate upward. It's still below John's price of $8,000, which gives me room to negotiate while potentially getting a better deal than my alternative option. The offer is also reasonable considering my maximum value of $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John at $8,000. Here's why:
1. Alice's current offer ($9,500) is still above my maximum value ($8,000)
2. While Alice has been coming down in price ($15,000 → $12,000 → $9,500), she's still not close enough to my maximum value
3. John's offer ($8,000) is exactly at my maximum value
4. While we could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will go below $8,000
5. We've already used 5 rounds, and continuing to negotiate carries the risk of not reaching a better deal

Therefore, it's most rational to take John's guaranteed offer of $8,000 now."
