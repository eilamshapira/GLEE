"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $900000. Let me know if this works for you.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that my initial price was a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth more than $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. Let's discuss a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise. However, $1200000 is still beyond what I can justify spending. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your revised offer of $950000. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I still need to consider the product's value and my initial investment.

"Hi Alice, thanks for moving closer to my price. However, $1050000 is still above what I can spend. I'm willing to go up to $990000. This is my final offer, as it's the absolute maximum I can afford. Let me know if we can close the deal at this price.",990000.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer of $990000. I understand that this is the maximum you're willing to spend, and I respect that. However, I still need to consider the product's value and my initial investment. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to ensure it's still a fair deal for me. I'll meet you at $1000000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,9,
