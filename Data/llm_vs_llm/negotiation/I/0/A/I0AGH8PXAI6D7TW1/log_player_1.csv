"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $900000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target price. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is still an option, but I'd like to explore the possibility of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that my initial price was a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth more than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. Let's discuss a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise. However, $1200000 is still beyond what I can justify spending. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. While $950,000 is getting closer to my target, I still believe I can get a better price. Since Bob is willing to increase his offer, I'll try to meet him in the middle again, but this time, I'll aim slightly higher. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is still a viable option, but I'd like to see if I can reach a deal with Bob. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer of $1,075,000 to Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your revised offer of $950,000. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I still need to consider the product's value and my initial investment. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure it's a fair deal for both parties. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1075000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, $1075000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $975000. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. While $975,000 is a significant increase from Bob's initial offer, it's still below my target price. Since Bob has stated that this is his highest offer, I need to decide whether to accept a lower price or explore other options. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is becoming a more attractive option, but I'll try to make one more attempt to reach a deal with Bob.

Next, I'll send a counteroffer of $1,050,000 to Bob, which is a slight reduction from my previous offer, to see if he's willing to budge further."

I understand that this is the highest you're willing to go, but I still need to consider the product's value and my initial investment.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for moving closer to my price. However, $1050000 is still above what I can spend. I'm willing to go up to $990000. This is my final offer, as it's the absolute maximum I can afford. Let me know if we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll consider my next move carefully. Bob's final offer of $990,000 is still below my target price, and I have a better alternative with John's offer of $1,200,000. Since Bob has stated that this is his absolute maximum, I don't see much room for further negotiation.

Given that I have only two rounds left, I think it's time to make a strategic decision. I could try to make another counteroffer, but it's unlikely to change Bob's stance. Instead, I'll weigh the pros and cons of accepting Bob's offer versus selling to John.

For now, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, but I'm inclined to sell to John if the next round doesn't bring a significantly better offer from Bob."
