Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $20000 is beyond my budget. Based on my evaluation, I can comfortably purchase it at $7500. If you can accommodate this price, I'm ready to close the deal immediately. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
