"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for $14999.  I know it's valuable to you, and this is a great price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Looking at Alice's offer and my options:

1. Alice is offering the product for $14,999
2. The product is worth up to $15,000 to me
3. My alternative is buying from John for $15,000

Alice's offer is only $1 cheaper than John's price. While this is technically a savings, it's minimal. However, since my goal is to save as much money as possible while buying the product, and Alice's offer is below my maximum valuation, accepting her offer is the rational choice.
