"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $120 seems a bit high. Given market conditions, I'd be comfortable paying $95 for it. This would still give you a good profit margin while being a fair price for me. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your perspective, $95 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $110, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. Let's meet in the middle - how about $105? This price reflects a good balance between the value of the product and your budget. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
