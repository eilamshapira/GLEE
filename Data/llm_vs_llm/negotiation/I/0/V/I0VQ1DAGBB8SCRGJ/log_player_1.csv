Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $120 seems a bit high. Given market conditions, I'd be comfortable paying $95 for it. This would still give you a good profit margin while being a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.
