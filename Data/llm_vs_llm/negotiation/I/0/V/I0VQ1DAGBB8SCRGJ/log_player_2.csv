"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $120. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this strategically:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. Alice's current offer is $120
3. I know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation
4. John's price ($150) is my worst-case scenario

Since $120 is well below my maximum ($150), but I know Alice has significant room for profit margin (as it's worth $80 to her), I should try to negotiate for a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's above Alice's cost but lower than her asking price:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $120 seems a bit high. Given market conditions, I'd be comfortable paying $95 for it. This would still give you a good profit margin while being a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. Let's meet in the middle - how about $105? This price reflects a good balance between the value of the product and your budget. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","This is a good development:

1. Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $120 to $105
2. This is still above her cost ($80) so she's making a profit
3. It's well below my maximum value ($150)
4. The movement from $120 to $105 shows she's willing to negotiate reasonably
5. While there might be room for a bit more negotiation, the current price is quite fair

Given that this is a reasonable price and significantly better than John's option ($150), I'll accept this offer.
