"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think your price is a little high.  Would you consider a lower price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you, Bob, for your offer. I understand that you think my initial price was a bit high, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your interest and the product's worth to you, I'd like to make a counteroffer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1300000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1150000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. Considering your last offer of $1150000 and my previous offer of $1300000, I'd like to split the difference and propose a price of $1225000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope it's more in line with what you're looking for.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for coming down further.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about we settle at $1100000?",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a price that fits your budget, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, I need to ensure that I'm getting a fair deal. Considering your last offer of $1100000 and my previous offer of $1225000, I'm willing to make a further concession. I'll meet you halfway between those two prices, at $1162500. This is a serious offer, and I hope it's one that you'll consider seriously.",1162500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, you're right, we are getting close! I'm willing to increase my offer to $1130000 to get this done today.",1130000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal. I appreciate your increased offer of $1130000. At this point, I'm willing to make a small concession to finalize the sale. I'll offer the product to you for $1120000, which is a slight reduction from my previous offer. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I think we can shake hands and complete the deal.",1120000.0,Alice,9,
