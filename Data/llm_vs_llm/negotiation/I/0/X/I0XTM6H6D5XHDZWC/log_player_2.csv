However, I need to ensure that I'm getting a fair deal. Considering your last offer of $1100000 and my previous offer of $1225000, I'm willing to make a further concession. I'll meet you halfway between those two prices, at $1162500. This is a serious offer, and I hope it's one that you'll consider seriously.
