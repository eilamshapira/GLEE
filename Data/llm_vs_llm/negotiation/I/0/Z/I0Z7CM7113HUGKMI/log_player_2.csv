"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let's analyze:

*   **Alice's offer:** $1,100,000
*   **Your value:** $1,200,000 (maximum you're willing to pay)
*   **John's offer:** $1,200,000

If you accept Alice's offer, you pay $1,100,000.

If you buy from John, you pay $1,200,000.

Since $1,100,000 is less than $1,200,000, it's the better option.
