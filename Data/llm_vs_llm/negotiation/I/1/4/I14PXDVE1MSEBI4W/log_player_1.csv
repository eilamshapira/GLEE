Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and high demand, I'm valuing it at $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** Mentioning ""unique value"" and ""high demand"" aims to pique Bob's interest and potentially justify the price in his mind.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" signals that you're open to discussing the price further, making Bob more likely to engage.

By starting at $20,000, we leave room to potentially negotiate down to a price that's still significantly higher than John's $15,000 offer, while still maintaining the possibility of Bob accepting the initial offer."
