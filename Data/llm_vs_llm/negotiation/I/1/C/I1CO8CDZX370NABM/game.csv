"Alice, while I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, the price you're asking is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, considering its potential value to me. Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800000 is lower than what I'm looking for. I can come down a bit. How about $1400000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $1400000 is still out of my budget. I can go up to $900000, which I believe is a fair offer given the value I see in the product. Please let me know if this works for you.",900000.0,Bob,4,
