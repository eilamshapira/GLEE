Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my offer to Bob. The product is worth $800,000 to him, which is the same as its worth to me. Since I have a guaranteed backup buyer (John) who will pay me $800,000, I have nothing to lose by offering Bob a price slightly higher than $800,000.

If Bob accepts my offer, I'll make more than my minimum acceptable amount. If he rejects it, I still get my $800,000 from John.
