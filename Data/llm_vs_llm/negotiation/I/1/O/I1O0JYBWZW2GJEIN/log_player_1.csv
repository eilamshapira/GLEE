Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll reject Bob's offer since it's significantly below even my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 (John's offer). I can either continue negotiating with Bob or take John's guaranteed offer. Since Bob's initial offer was quite low, suggesting we're far apart in our valuations, I'll take the guaranteed offer from John.
