# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product that I know will be of significant value to you. Considering its quality and utility, I'm selling it for $90. This is a fair price that allows you both to get a product worth $100 to you at a discount, while also providing me with reasonable compensation above my minimum threshold. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with this purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.
