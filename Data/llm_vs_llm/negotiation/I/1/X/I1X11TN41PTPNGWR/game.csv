"Bob, I understand you're interested in acquiring this unique product. Given its immense value and the significant benefits it offers, my initial asking price is $1200000. I'm confident you'll see the return on investment is well worth it.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is well above my budget. Given that the product's value is $1000000 to you, I propose $750000, which would still give you a reasonable profit. I have other options available to me, including another seller offering $800000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750000 is below my minimum acceptable price. As I mentioned earlier, this product holds significant value, and I am firm on not selling it below $1050000. It's a substantial discount from my initial offer and is as low as I am willing to go.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
