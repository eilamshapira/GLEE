Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is well above my budget. Given that the product's value is $1000000 to you, I propose $750000, which would still give you a reasonable profit. I have other options available to me, including another seller offering $800000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
