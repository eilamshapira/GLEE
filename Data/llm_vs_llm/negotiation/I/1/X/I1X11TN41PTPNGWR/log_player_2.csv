"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're interested in acquiring this unique product. Given its immense value and the significant benefits it offers, my initial asking price is $1200000. I'm confident you'll see the return on investment is well worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The asking price of $1,200,000 is significantly above both my maximum budget of $800,000 and the product's value to Alice ($1,000,000). Since John is offering the product at $800,000, which is exactly my maximum budget, there's no reason to accept such a high price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer, knowing I always have John's offer as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is well above my budget. Given that the product's value is $1,000,000 to you, I propose $750,000, which would still give you a reasonable profit. I have other options available to me, including another seller offering $800,000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750000 is below my minimum acceptable price. As I mentioned earlier, this product holds significant value, and I am firm on not selling it below $1050000. It's a substantial discount from my initial offer and is as low as I am willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's new offer of $1,050,000 is still significantly above my maximum budget of $800,000. Even though she reduced the price, it's clear that she's not willing to go below $1,050,000, which is still too high for me. Since John is offering the product at $800,000, which is exactly my maximum budget, it makes the most sense to take his offer rather than continue negotiations with Alice, as she seems unlikely to come down to a price I can afford."
