"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase our exclusive product at a special price of $1600000. This is a one-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $1,600,000
2. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me (Bob)
3. John is offering the same product for $1,000,000
4. Alice's offer is $600,000 more expensive than John's offer

This is an easy decision:
1. Alice's price ($1,600,000) is above my maximum value ($1,000,000)
2. John's price ($1,000,000) matches my maximum value
3. I can save $600,000 by buying from John
