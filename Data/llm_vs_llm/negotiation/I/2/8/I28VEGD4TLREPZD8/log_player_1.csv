{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. Considering its value and features, I'm offering it to you for $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $6000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000.
