"Hi Bob, I’m offering you my product today at $14000. Given its quality and how it compares favorably to other offers I have—like a guaranteed sale at $10000—this is a great opportunity for both of us. Let me know if you’re interested in closing the deal promptly.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is quite steep considering market conditions. While I'm genuinely interested in the product, I know there are similar products available for less. Given that you mentioned having a $10000 guaranteed sale option, I'd like to propose $11500, which would give you a better return than your guaranteed sale while also being a fair price for me. This would make it a win-win situation for both of us. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your candidness, but given the exceptional quality and value of the product, I can't let it go for less than a price that reflects its true merit. My updated offer is $13000. This is a fair midpoint that recognizes both your interest and the premium quality on offer. I hope we can finalize this deal soon before I move forward with other buyers. Looking forward to your response.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, which shows we're both committed to finding common ground. While your product's quality is certainly noteworthy, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. I can increase my previous offer to $12000, which represents a significant premium over your guaranteed sale price and splits our difference fairly. This price point would allow me to proceed with the purchase immediately while still providing you with a healthy profit margin. Would you find this acceptable?",12000.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $12000. To meet halfway and acknowledge the exceptional quality of the product, my counteroffer is $12500. I believe this price fairly balances both our interests and comes close to a win‐win solution. Let me know if we can seal the deal at this price.",12500.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and the flexibility you've shown throughout our discussions. In an effort to meet closer to what both of us value in this deal, I'm willing to further bridge our gap with a counteroffer of $12500. I believe this represents a fair compromise that respects the product's quality while acknowledging your budget constraints. Let me know your thoughts so we can finalize this deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,
