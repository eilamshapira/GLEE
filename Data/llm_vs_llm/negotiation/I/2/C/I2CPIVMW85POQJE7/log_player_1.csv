Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is quite steep considering market conditions. While I'm genuinely interested in the product, I know there are similar products available for less. Given that you mentioned having a $10000 guaranteed sale option, I'd like to propose $11500, which would give you a better return than your guaranteed sale while also being a fair price for me. This would make it a win-win situation for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, which shows we're both committed to finding common ground. While your product's quality is certainly noteworthy, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. I can increase my previous offer to $12000, which represents a significant premium over your guaranteed sale price and splits our difference fairly. This price point would allow me to proceed with the purchase immediately while still providing you with a healthy profit margin. Would you find this acceptable?
