"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you my product today at $14000. Given its quality and how it compares favorably to other offers I have—like a guaranteed sale at $10000—this is a great opportunity for both of us. Let me know if you’re interested in closing the deal promptly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $15,000
2. Alice is offering $14,000
3. I know the product is worth $10,000 to Alice
4. John's fixed price is $15,000

Alice's offer of $14,000 is too close to both my maximum value ($15,000) and John's price ($15,000). Since Alice mentioned she has a guaranteed sale at $10,000, and that's the actual worth to her, there's significant room for negotiation. A rejection and counteroffer would be the best strategy here, as I could potentially save thousands of dollars.

John's option at $15,000 is the worst choice as it's the highest price.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is quite steep considering market conditions. While I'm genuinely interested in the product, I know there are similar products available for less. Given that you mentioned having a $10,000 guaranteed sale option, I'd like to propose $11,500, which would give you a better return than your guaranteed sale while also being a fair price for me. This would make it a win-win situation for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your candidness, but given the exceptional quality and value of the product, I can't let it go for less than a price that reflects its true merit. My updated offer is $13000. This is a fair midpoint that recognizes both your interest and the premium quality on offer. I hope we can finalize this deal soon before I move forward with other buyers. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this updated situation:

1. Alice has dropped from $14,000 to $13,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. This is a $1,000 reduction from her initial offer
3. The product is still worth $10,000 to her, so there's still room for negotiation
4. My previous offer of $11,500 was rejected, but Alice didn't dismiss it completely

While $13,000 is better than the initial $14,000 offer, there's still potential to negotiate further down. The $2,000 gap between her current offer ($13,000) and my previous offer ($11,500) suggests room for further negotiation. John's option at $15,000 remains the worst choice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, which shows we're both committed to finding common ground. While your product's quality is certainly noteworthy, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. I can increase my previous offer to $12,000, which represents a significant premium over your guaranteed sale price and splits our difference fairly. This price point would allow me to proceed with the purchase immediately while still providing you with a healthy profit margin. Would you find this acceptable?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and the flexibility you've shown throughout our discussions. In an effort to meet closer to what both of us value in this deal, I'm willing to further bridge our gap with a counteroffer of $12500. I believe this represents a fair compromise that respects the product's quality while acknowledging your budget constraints. Let me know your thoughts so we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The negotiation has progressed well:
   - Alice started at $14,000
   - Dropped to $13,000
   - Now at $12,500
2. The current offer of $12,500 is:
   - $2,500 less than my maximum value ($15,000)
   - $2,500 more than Alice's cost ($10,000)
   - A perfect middle ground between our last positions ($12,000 vs $13,000)
3. This represents a fair split of the surplus value

Given that:
- Alice has shown consistent willingness to negotiate
- We've reached a reasonable middle ground
- The price is significantly better than John's $15,000
- Further negotiation might risk the deal for marginal gains

This appears to be a fair compromise that creates value for both parties.
