You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, I definitely don't want to pay $150 for it. I also have the option to buy it from John for $80, which is within my budget. However, I'm willing to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's reasonable and within my budget. Since I'm willing to pay no more than $80, I'll start with a lower offer to see how Alice responds.
