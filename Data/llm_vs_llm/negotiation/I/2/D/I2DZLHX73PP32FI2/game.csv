"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",8000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $13500. This price reflects the high value and quality of the product. Let me know what you think!",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that we're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to lower my previous offer to $13000. This is a significant discount from the original price and reflects my desire to work with you. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $13000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering my initial offer and your willingness to negotiate, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9500. This price reflects a compromise between our initial positions and demonstrates my serious interest in purchasing the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9500 is still below our minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $12500, which is very close to my bottom line. This is the best I can do to meet you in the middle while ensuring the value of the product is respected. Let me know if this works for you.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but I need to stick to my minimum value. I'm offering the product now at $12250. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",12250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12250 is still above my budget. Since you mentioned this is your final offer before considering other options, I'd like to make a serious counteroffer of $10500. This price is closer to my limit, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle to close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10500 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to go down to $12000, which is the absolute minimum I can do. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you can meet me at this price.",,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're close, but I need to maintain the product's value. I'm offering it at $12000, which is my final and lowest possible price. This is a great deal, and I hope we can finalize the sale at this amount.",12000.0,Alice,7,
