"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to share with you a unique product that I believe will greatly benefit you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's initial offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($15,000), and I have the option to buy the same product from John for the same price, I don't see any benefit in accepting Alice's offer immediately. However, I also don't want to give up the potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to negotiate a lower price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. This will give us room to negotiate and potentially find a mutually beneficial price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I can offer it to you for $12000. I believe this is a fair price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down from her initial offer of $15,000 to $12,000, which is a positive sign. However, I still believe there's room for further negotiation. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'm not ready to accept $12,000 just yet. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, trying to meet somewhere in the middle of my previous offer ($8,000) and Alice's current offer ($12,000).

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll send a new counteroffer to Alice. 

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I've already sent my counteroffer in the previous response. To reiterate:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
