"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $22000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the $10000 you estimate. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22000 is way out of my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $6000 for the product. Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $6000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. Would $17000 work for you?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I can go up to $8000, but that's my absolute limit.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be closer to my original asking price for this to make sense.  My final offer is $12000.  This is a significant discount and reflects my willingness to find a compromise.  What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
