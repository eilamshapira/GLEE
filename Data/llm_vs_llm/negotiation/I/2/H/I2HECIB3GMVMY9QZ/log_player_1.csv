Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $22,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the $10,000 you estimate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a high initial offer to give myself room to negotiate. The goal is to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point. Even if he rejects this offer, it sets the stage for a potentially more favorable counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22000 is way out of my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $6000 for the product. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $6,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a significant loss. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a fair price for the product.  I'll use my counter-offer to try and bring him closer to a reasonable price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $6,000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. Would $17,000 work for you?"", ""product_price"": 17000}

**Reasoning:** I'm drastically lowering my price but still staying well above both his valuation and my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also aiming to keep the price anchored above his initial lowball offer.  Hopefully, this encourages him to engage in a more reasonable negotiation range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I can go up to $8000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** While Bob has increased his offer, $8,000 is still considerably lower than both my minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. I'll make one more attempt to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to $12,000. If Bob isn't receptive, I'll cut my losses and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be closer to my original asking price for this to make sense.  My final offer is $12,000.  This is a significant discount and reflects my willingness to find a compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

**Reasoning:**  This offer is my ""walk-away"" point. It's still a  profit, although less than I'd hoped for.  By presenting it as my final offer, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to make a decision.  This final offer strategy often helps bridge the gap and avoids a stalled negotiation."
