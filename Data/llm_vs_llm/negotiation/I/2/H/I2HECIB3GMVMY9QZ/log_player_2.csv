"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $22000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the $10000 you estimate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and even your maximum valuation of the product. It's highly unlikely she'll come down to a reasonable price in a single step. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way out of my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for the product. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) than my actual limit ($10,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is respectful but clearly states my budget limitations. 
* **Aiming for a Deal:** I'm not immediately jumping to John's offer. There's a chance Alice is highly motivated to sell and might surprise me with a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $6000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. Would $17000 work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving in the right direction, $17,000 is still significantly higher than both my budget and my maximum valuation. I need to show her I'm serious about a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I can go up to $8,000, but that's my absolute limit."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer to $8,000, showing willingness to negotiate but not making a huge jump. 
* **Firm Limit:** By stating ""$8,000 is my absolute limit,"" I'm signaling to Alice that I'm serious and this negotiation could end soon if she's not willing to be more flexible.
* **Still Below John:** I'm staying well below my fallback option of buying from John for $10,000 to maintain negotiating leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be closer to my original asking price for this to make sense.  My final offer is $12000.  This is a significant discount and reflects my willingness to find a compromise.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is closer to reasonable, it's still above my backup option of buying from John for $10,000. Alice has also indicated this is her ""final offer.""  At this point, it's unlikely she'll go any lower, and I'm better off taking the guaranteed savings."
