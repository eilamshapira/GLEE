You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","The offer of $300 is far too high, as I value the product at a maximum of $120. I definitely don't want to pay $300 for it. Buying from John is an option, but I'll try to negotiate with Alice first to see if I can get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that I value the product at no more than $120, I'll start with a significantly lower offer to see how Alice responds. This gives me room to negotiate upwards if needed.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $280. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $280
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice is still way off with her offer of $280. It's nowhere near my maximum value of $120. I'll reject again and see if I can get her to budge further with another counteroffer. Buying from John is still an option.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, Alice didn't like my initial offer of $60. Let's try a more moderate offer, but still well below my maximum value and John's price.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice is being unreasonable. Her price is still extremely high. It's clear she's not willing to negotiate in good faith. Time to cut my losses and buy from John.
