"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to consider my options carefully here.

The product is worth at most $80 to me.
- Alice is offering it for $120, which exceeds the value I place on it
- John is willing to sell it to me for $80, which matches the maximum I'm willing to pay

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and Alice's offer exceeds the value I place on the product, the rational choice is to buy from John.
