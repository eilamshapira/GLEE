Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. I know the product is worth at least $120 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120. Therefore, when offering to Bob, I should ask for more than $120 to maximize my potential profit. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'll set a price that's notably higher than my minimum but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected.
