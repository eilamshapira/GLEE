"Bob, I'm excited to finally discuss this opportunity with you. This product is incredibly valuable, and I know it could be transformative for your business. Given its unique capabilities and potential ROI, I'm initially offering it for $1750000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm and see the potential of this product, your initial offer of $1750000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. To make this a worthwhile deal for both of us, I'm willing to offer $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I can derive from this product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While I understand budget constraints, $850000 is still too low considering the value and the $1500000 I can get from John. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1625000. Let me know what you think.",1625000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1625000 is still a bit out of my range.  Given my budget constraints and the fact that I can secure the product for $800000 elsewhere, I'm prepared to offer $950000.  I believe this reflects a fair compromise, allowing both of us to make a worthwhile deal. ",950000.0,Bob,4,
