Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm and see the potential of this product, your initial offer of $1750000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. To make this a worthwhile deal for both of us, I'm willing to offer $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I can derive from this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
