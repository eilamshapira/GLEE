"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a rare find and I'm sure you'll appreciate its value. I believe this could be a great fit for your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I should consider my options carefully here:

1. Alice is offering the product for $15,000
2. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
3. John is willing to sell me the same product for $12,000

Alice's offer exceeds both my maximum valuation and John's alternative price. There's no reason to accept this offer, and I should either make a counteroffer or go with John's option.

Since John's price matches my maximum valuation, and there's uncertainty about whether Alice would accept a lower price, the rational choice is:
