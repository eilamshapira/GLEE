"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this offer. Alice is offering the product for $14,000. It's worth no more than $15,000 to me, so this offer is within my acceptable range. However:

1) The product costs Alice $12,000
2) John is willing to sell it to me for $15,000
3) I still have 10 rounds of negotiation available

Since Alice's costs are $12,000, there's room to negotiate a better price than $14,000. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to save more money.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but still leaves me room to negotiate further if needed.

{""product_price"": $12,800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I see that Alice has lowered her price from $14,000 to $13,700, which shows she's willing to negotiate. She rejected my offer of $12,800, but we're making progress. The current price of $13,700 is $1,300 below my maximum of $15,000, but I believe there's still room to negotiate since Alice's cost is $12,000.

I'll reject this offer and try another counteroffer to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $13,200}"
