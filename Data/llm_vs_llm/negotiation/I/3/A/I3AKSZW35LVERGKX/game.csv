"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you exclusive access to this incredible product. Given its immense value to you, I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects that value. How about we start with an offer of... $1450000?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation, but I think we can find a price that works better for both of us. The product is worth $1000000 to you, and while I'm interested, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. I'm willing to offer $1150000, which gives you a substantial profit while allowing me some savings compared to other options on the market. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. However, given the unique value this product provides, I believe we can meet somewhere closer to its true worth. How about we settle at $1375000? I am sure you will benefit greatly from this product.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on your price, Alice. That shows we're making progress. However, I still feel we can find a better middle ground. Given that the product costs you $1000000, I'm offering $1250000, which provides you with a substantial $250000 profit while still giving me some savings. This seems like a fair deal that benefits us both. What do you say?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, considering the significant benefits this product offers to your operation, I believe it is worth more than what you are offering. Let's aim for a final price of $1325000. I'm confident that you will find this product extremely valuable, and this price reflects that.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I can see we're getting closer to an agreement, which is great. You've moved down to $1325000 and I really appreciate that flexibility. To meet you part way, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1275000. This gives you a healthy $275000 profit on your $1000000 cost, which is a 27.5% return. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both substantially. I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price and start our business relationship on a positive note.",1275000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and your willingness to work with me. I still believe that the true value of this product is higher than what you are offering. To try and find a price that works for us both, I will lower the price to $1300000. This is a great deal for you in the long term.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
