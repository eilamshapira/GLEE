"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you exclusive access to this incredible product. Given its immense value to you, I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects that value. How about we start with an offer of... $1,450,000?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation, but I think we can find a price that works better for both of us. The product is worth $1000000 to you, and while I'm interested, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. I'm willing to offer $1150000, which gives you a substantial profit while allowing me some savings compared to other options on the market. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Okay, I need to carefully consider Bob's offer. $1,150,000 is more than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, so it is tempting. However, I believe the product's true value to Bob is much higher, and I'm willing to take a small risk to try and get a better price.

Therefore, I will **Reject Bob's offer** and proceed with a counteroffer.

My answer is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, time to push for a better deal. Here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. However, given the unique value this product provides, I believe we can meet somewhere closer to its true worth. How about we settle at $1,375,000? I am sure you will benefit greatly from this product."", ""product_price"": 1375000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on your price, Alice. That shows we're making progress. However, I still feel we can find a better middle ground. Given that the product costs you $1000000, I'm offering $1250000, which provides you with a substantial $250000 profit while still giving me some savings. This seems like a fair deal that benefits us both. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Okay, Bob is clearly trying to negotiate hard. $1,250,000 is still significantly more than my minimum price, and it's a good profit. But I know the product is worth more to him, and I want to maximize my earnings. I still think I can get a better deal.

Therefore, I will **Reject Bob's offer** and make a counteroffer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, considering the significant benefits this product offers to your operation, I believe it is worth more than what you are offering. Let's aim for a final price of $1,325,000. I'm confident that you will find this product extremely valuable, and this price reflects that."", ""product_price"": 1325000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I can see we're getting closer to an agreement, which is great. You've moved down to $1325000 and I really appreciate that flexibility. To meet you part way, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1275000. This gives you a healthy $275000 profit on your $1000000 cost, which is a 27.5% return. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both substantially. I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price and start our business relationship on a positive note. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.
