"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $150, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 seems a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $90. Would that work for you?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be out of your budget, but $90 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I'm trying to be flexible here.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for counter-offering, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility, but $140 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about $105?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. $105 is getting closer, but I still need to get a bit more for the product. Considering your last offer and my previous one, how about $122.50? It's a small step up from your offer, and I'm trying to be as flexible as possible.",122.5,Alice,5,
