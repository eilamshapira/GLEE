Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $150, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 seems a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $90. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price. My next offer will be $140, which is still higher than my minimum acceptable price but shows willingness to negotiate. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be out of your budget, but $90 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I'm trying to be flexible here."", ""product_price"": 140}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for counter-offering, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility, but $140 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about $105?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, trying to get closer to a price that I'm comfortable with while still being open to negotiation. Since Bob's offer of $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my previous counteroffer.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. $105 is getting closer, but I still need to get a bit more for the product. Considering your last offer and my previous one, how about $122.50? It's a small step up from your offer, and I'm trying to be as flexible as possible."", ""product_price"": 122.50}"
