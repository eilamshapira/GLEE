"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $150, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be out of your budget, but $90 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I'm trying to be flexible here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. $105 is getting closer, but I still need to get a bit more for the product. Considering your last offer and my previous one, how about $122.50? It's a small step up from your offer, and I'm trying to be as flexible as possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

```

While Alice is trying to be flexible, $122.50 exceeds my $120 budget.  It's not worth haggling further for a $2.50 difference, so I'll buy from John."
