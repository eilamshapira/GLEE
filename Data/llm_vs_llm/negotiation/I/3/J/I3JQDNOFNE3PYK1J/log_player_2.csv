"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, reject it, or buy from John.

Alice's offer: $1,000,000
John's offer: $1,000,000
The product's worth to me: No more than $1,000,000

Since both Alice and John are offering the exact same price of $1,000,000, and this matches the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I'm indifferent between options 1 and 3. However, I should make a decision rather than rejecting without an alternative.
