"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you for a competitive price. I've taken into consideration the product's worth and I'm starting with a price that reflects its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given the information:
- The product is worth no more than $800,000 to you
- Alice is offering it for $1,500,000
- John is willing to sell the same product for $800,000

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum valuation and exactly matches what the product is worth to her. There's no reason to accept this offer or even continue negotiating when you have a guaranteed option to purchase at your maximum value point.
