"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I believe it would be a valuable asset for you. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice is offering the product for your maximum budget.  There's no benefit to buying from her when you can get the same price from John.  You might be able to get a better deal by rejecting her offer and seeing if she'll come down in price, but there's no guarantee."
