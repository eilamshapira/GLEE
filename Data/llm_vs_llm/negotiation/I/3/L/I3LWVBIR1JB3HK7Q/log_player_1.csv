Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer, while also maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with this counteroffer. It's a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still closer to my target than his offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate, while also maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to sell the product for a higher price, Bob's offer of $700,000 is a good compromise. It's close enough to my minimum acceptable price that it makes sense to accept it, rather than risk further negotiation and potentially losing the sale to Bob.

It's important to remember that the goal is to maximize profit, and in this case, accepting Bob's offer is the best way to achieve that goal."
