Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you. I believe it would be valuable for you, and I'm willing to sell it for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer because:
1. Bob's offer of $80 is well below my minimum value of $120
2. I already have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, so I won't accept anything below that
3. Bob's willingness to negotiate suggests there might be room to reach a better price

I'll continue negotiating with Bob to try to get a better price, knowing I always have the $120 option with John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $80 is too low for this product. Given its quality and value, I couldn't go below $160. This is already a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still more than I'm hoping to spend.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere, say at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John because:
1. Bob's offer is exactly the same as John's ($120)
2. Since Bob has been negotiating down from $80 to $120, there's a chance he might try to negotiate even lower in the next rounds
3. There's no guarantee we'll reach a better price with Bob
4. Getting $120 from John now is a sure thing and meets my minimum acceptable price

It makes more sense to take the guaranteed $120 from John rather than continue negotiating with Bob when he's only offering the same amount."
