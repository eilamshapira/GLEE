"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $15000 is beyond what I'm willing to pay for this product. I should mention that I can get the same product from another seller for $12000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better agreement. Would you consider $10000 for the product?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand you have other options.  However, $10000 is significantly lower than what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $13000 to close the deal.  Let me know if this works for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
