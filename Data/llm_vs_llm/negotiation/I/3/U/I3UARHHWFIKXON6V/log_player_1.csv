"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $15000 is beyond what I'm willing to pay for this product. I should mention that I can get the same product from another seller for $12000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better agreement. Would you consider $10000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
