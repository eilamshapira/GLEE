"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $15000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer and compare it to my alternatives.

Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which exceeds the maximum value of $12,000 that the product is worth to me. Additionally, I have the option to buy the same product from John for $12,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's offer exceeds both my valuation and the alternative option from John, it makes sense to reject this initial offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $15,000 is beyond what I'm willing to pay for this product. I should mention that I can get the same product from another seller for $12,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better agreement. Would you consider $10,000 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand you have other options.  However, $10000 is significantly lower than what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $13000 to close the deal.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer and compare it to my alternatives.

Alice has reduced her price to $13,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still more than the $12,000 I can pay to John for the same product, and it's also above my maximum valuation of $12,000.

Given that I can get the product from John at exactly my maximum valuation ($12,000), and Alice's offer exceeds this amount, it makes financial sense to buy from John instead.
