"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $9,500
2. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
3. I know Alice's cost is $8,000
4. John's price is $10,000 (my fallback option)

Alice's offer of $9,500 is slightly better than John's price of $10,000, but since I know Alice's cost is $8,000, there's room for negotiation. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as I might be able to get a better price from Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know Alice's cost is $8,000 and my maximum value is $10,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but gives me more savings. I'll offer $8,500, which:

1. Gives Alice a $500 profit margin above her cost
2. Saves me $1,500 compared to my maximum value
3. Is significantly better than John's price of $10,000
4. Leaves room for negotiation if Alice counters

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Let me analyze this new offer:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $9,500 to $9,000
2. This is a $1,000 savings compared to John's price of $10,000
3. It gives Alice a $1,000 profit margin above her cost of $8,000
4. While we might get a slightly better price by continuing to negotiate, there's a risk Alice might not go much lower

This is actually a reasonable offer. The $9,000 price point represents:
- A good savings for me ($1,000 less than my maximum value)
- A fair profit for Alice
- A significant improvement from the initial offer

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer rather than risk losing the deal by pushing too hard.
