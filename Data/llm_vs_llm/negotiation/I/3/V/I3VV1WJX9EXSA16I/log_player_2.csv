"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Alice's offer: $14,500
2. John's price: $15,000
3. My maximum value: $15,000

Alice's offer is $500 less than John's price, and it's within my maximum value of $15,000. While Alice is making a significant profit (considering her cost is $12,000), accepting her offer would still save me $500 compared to buying from John.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, I should accept Alice's offer.
