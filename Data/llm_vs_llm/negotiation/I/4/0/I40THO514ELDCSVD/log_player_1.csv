"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $150. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm more comfortable around $60. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer because:
1. $60 is way below my minimum acceptable price of $120
2. I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate
3. I can always sell to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob fail
4. Even though the product is worth $80 to Bob, there might be room to negotiate a price closer to my minimum

I'll continue negotiating to try to find a mutually beneficial price, but I know I have the safety net of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is significantly below what I can accept for this product. Given its quality and value, I couldn't go below $130. This is already a reduction from my initial offer, considering the product's worth. Would you be able to meet me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your response, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I really need to stay within my budget. How about $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I choose to sell to John because:
1. Bob's offers ($60, now $70) are still far below my minimum acceptable price of $120
2. Since the product is only worth $80 to Bob, it's unlikely he'll ever offer more than that
3. John's guaranteed offer of $120 matches my minimum acceptable price
4. Continuing negotiations with Bob would likely be futile since there's no price point that would satisfy both of us (needs to be ≥$120 for me but ≤$80 for Bob)

It's best to take John's offer now rather than waste more time negotiating when there's no possible win-win outcome with Bob."
