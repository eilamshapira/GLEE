"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. Unfortunately, that price is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $7000.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $7000 is too low for me, I can offer you a middle ground. How about $12500? Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the adjustment. I'm getting closer, but $12500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $9000? That would work much better for me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand where you're coming from, but I have to hold my ground on price. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? I think it could be a great deal for both of us. Let me know!",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, I do have another offer at a significantly lower price point.  To be fair to you, I'm willing to offer $9500, but that's the best I can do.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate. While $9500 is a step up, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the value of the product. How about $10500? I believe it's a fair compromise. Looking forward to your thoughts!",10500.0,Alice,7,
