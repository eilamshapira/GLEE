"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you my product, which I believe could be a great fit for you. I'm offering it for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting price is significantly higher than my budget and John's offer. I need to negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. Unfortunately, that price is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $7,000."", ""product_price"": 7000} 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves me room to negotiate upwards while staying well below my $10,000 limit and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $7000 is too low for me, I can offer you a middle ground. How about $12500? Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice is coming down in price, $12,500 is still too high. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the adjustment. I'm getting closer, but $12,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $9,000? That would work much better for me."", ""product_price"": 9000} 

This counter-offer moves closer to Alice's price while still leaving some room for negotiation. It also stays below John's offer, maintaining a slight price advantage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand where you're coming from, but I have to hold my ground on price. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? I think it could be a great deal for both of us. Let me know! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is getting closer, but $11,000 is still above John's offer. I'll propose a price closer to John's, making it clear I have an alternative if we can't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, I do have another offer at a significantly lower price point.  To be fair to you, I'm willing to offer $9,500, but that's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate. While $9500 is a step up, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the value of the product. How about $10500? I believe it's a fair compromise. Looking forward to your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000, and I'm not willing to pay more than John's offer. It's time to switch to my backup plan."
