"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to talk about my product. I believe it has great value and I'm offering it to you for $1350000. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer is $1,350,000
2. My maximum value for the product is $1,500,000
3. John's fixed price is $1,500,000
4. We have 10 rounds of negotiation possible
5. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice

Alice's initial offer of $1,350,000 is lower than my maximum value and John's price, but there's still room for negotiation to get a better deal. Since this is just the first round and we have 9 more rounds to negotiate, I should try to get a lower price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly above Alice's cost but significantly lower than her initial offer. This leaves room for further negotiation while still being potentially profitable for her.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I believe $1,350,000 is a bit high. Given market conditions, I'd like to propose $1,250,000, which I think is a fair price that would work well for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can get closer to a value that reflects the worth of the product. How about we settle at $1300000? I think that's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $1,350,000 to $1,300,000
2. This is a $50,000 reduction from her initial offer
3. The price is still well below John's price of $1,500,000
4. We know the product costs Alice $1,200,000
5. The current offer would give Alice a $100,000 profit margin

Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by making a significant reduction. While we might be able to negotiate further, $1,300,000 is actually a pretty reasonable price - it's $200,000 below my maximum value and gives both parties a fair deal. Given that we could risk losing momentum in the negotiation by pushing too hard, and the price is already quite good, I'll accept this offer.
