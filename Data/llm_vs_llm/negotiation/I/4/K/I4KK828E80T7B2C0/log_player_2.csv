"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'll consider Alice's offer of $11,500.

The product is worth up to $12,000 to me, so Alice's offer is below my maximum valuation. John is offering the same product for $12,000, which is $500 more than Alice's current offer.

Since Alice's initial offer already saves me $500 compared to John's price, and there's potential to negotiate an even better price with Alice in future rounds, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice.

Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice and up to $12,000 to me, there's room for negotiation. I'll start with a lower offer to leave room for compromise in future rounds.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'll consider Alice's new offer of $11,000.

Alice has reduced her price by $500 from her initial offer, which is a good sign. The current offer of $11,000 is:
- $1,000 less than John's price of $12,000
- $1,000 more than Alice's cost of $10,000

This is a reasonable offer, but there's still room for negotiation. Since Alice has shown willingness to lower her price, and we have several rounds remaining, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $10,700}"
