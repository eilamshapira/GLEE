"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you my exclusive product today for $2000000. This offer represents a unique opportunity, and I’m confident it will add significant value for you. Let me know if you’re ready to proceed with this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The reasoning is simple: Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is twice the amount that the product is worth to me ($1,000,000), and it's also twice the amount that John is willing to sell it for. Since I know I can get the exact same product from John for $1,000,000, which is also my maximum valuation of the product, there's no reason to even negotiate with Alice. The best decision is to buy from John immediately."
