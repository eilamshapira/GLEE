"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest. I’m offering this exclusive product at $3000000. This is a unique opportunity based on its exceptional value, and I believe it represents a solid investment. Please let me know if you’d like to proceed or discuss any terms further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to make a decision based on the best financial outcome for me. Alice is offering the product for $3,000,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum valuation of $800,000. John is offering exactly $800,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

There's no reason to pay more than what the product is worth to me, and Alice's asking price is nearly 4 times my maximum value. Even with negotiation, it's unlikely Alice would drop her price from $3 million to below $800,000.
