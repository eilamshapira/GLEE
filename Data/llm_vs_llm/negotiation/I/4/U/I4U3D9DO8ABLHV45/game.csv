"Hello Bob, I have a wonderful product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and potential value.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $6000 for the product considering its value to me. Let me know if this works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand you have budget constraints, but I cannot go below $13500 as this product has considerable market value. I've reduced the price from my initial offer to show my willingness to negotiate, but I need to ensure the price reflects the product's true worth.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $13500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7000. This is the maximum I can go while still considering the product's value to me. Please let me know if this is something we can work with.",7000.0,Bob,4,
