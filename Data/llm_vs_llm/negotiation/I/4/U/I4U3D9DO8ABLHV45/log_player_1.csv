"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a wonderful product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and potential value."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $6000 for the product considering its value to me. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Since we still have several rounds left for negotiation, I'll try to reach a more favorable agreement with Bob before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand you have budget constraints, but I cannot go below $13,500 as this product has considerable market value. I've reduced the price from my initial offer to show my willingness to negotiate, but I need to ensure the price reflects the product's true worth."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $13500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7000. This is the maximum I can go while still considering the product's value to me. Please let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll take John's offer of $12,000. Bob's latest offer of $7,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and based on his previous responses and stated maximum budget, it seems unlikely that he will increase his offer to meet my minimum threshold. John's offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, so it's the most rational choice at this point."
