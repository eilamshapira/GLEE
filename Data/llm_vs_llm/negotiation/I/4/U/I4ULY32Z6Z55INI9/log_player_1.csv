Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider this carefully. I know the product is worth $15,000 to me, and I can sell it to John for $15,000 if Bob rejects my offer. However, the product is only worth $12,000 to Bob, so he won't accept any offer above that amount.

Since I'm guaranteed $15,000 from John, and Bob values the product at less than that, I should offer Bob a price that he will reject, ensuring I can sell to John instead.
