Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is significantly above my budget. Given my market research and available alternatives, I can offer $1200000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the current market conditions. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
