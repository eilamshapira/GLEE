"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this premium product. My initial offer is set at $2500000. This is a unique chance, and I'm confident the product can add significant value for you. I look forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll reject Alice's offer since $2,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,500,000 (which is also John's price). It would be better to either negotiate with Alice for a lower price or buy from John if we can't reach a reasonable agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's notably lower than my maximum value, giving room for negotiation while still being reasonable.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,500,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my market research and available alternatives, I can offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the current market conditions. I look forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
