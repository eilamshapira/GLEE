Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $120 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at $120, I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while potentially maximizing my profit.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120 (which I can get from John), and it's significantly lower than my initial offer, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let me make a new counteroffer to Bob with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above my minimum threshold.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 150}"
