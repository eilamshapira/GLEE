Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make an offer to Bob that balances maximizing my profit while still being accepted.

Bob values the product at $100, so any price below that would be rational for him to accept. If he rejects my offer, I'll sell to John for $80, which is my minimum acceptable value.

Since Bob knows I have this alternative, offering slightly above $80 would be reasonable. However, I want to capture more of the surplus while still making it attractive for Bob to accept. If I offer too close to $100, Bob might reject it.

A fair middle ground would be:

{""product_price"": 90}

This gives Bob a $10 benefit ($100 value - $90 price) while giving me a $10 premium over my alternative ($90 price - $80 alternative sale)."
