"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget concerns, but I cannot sell the product for $80 as it matches another offer I have. However, I'd be willing to lower the price to $110. I think this is a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price to $110. However, I'm still a bit short of that budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I can offer $90 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",90.0,Bob,4,
