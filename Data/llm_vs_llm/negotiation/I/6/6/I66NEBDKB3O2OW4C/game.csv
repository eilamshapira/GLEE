"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $2000000, considering the product's exceptional value and the fact that it's a one-of-a-kind item. I'm willing to make a concession to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your proposal. I'd like to counteroffer with a price of $1800000.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
