,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"Bob's offer is lower than what I initially wanted, so I'll try to get a better price."
"Thanks for the interest, Bob! I appreciate it. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get.",105.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - how about $100?  That way we both get a good deal and I can finally buy this product.",100.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,AcceptOffer,Bob's current offer of $100 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. I should accept the offer to guarantee a profit and end the negotiation.
