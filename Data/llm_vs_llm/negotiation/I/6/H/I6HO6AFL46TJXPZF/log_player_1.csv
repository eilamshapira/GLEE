Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $120."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, considering Bob's counteroffer and my options, I'll **reject** his offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""reason"": ""Bob's offer is lower than what I initially wanted, so I'll try to get a better price.""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the interest, Bob! I appreciate it. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get."", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - how about $100?  That way we both get a good deal and I can finally buy this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","This is a tough one. Bob is inching closer to what I want, but I still think I can squeeze a little more. However, I also don't want to risk losing the sale entirely. Considering the value of the product to me is $80 and the current offer is $100, I'll take the profit.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"", ""reason"": ""Bob's current offer of $100 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. I should accept the offer to guarantee a profit and end the negotiation.""}"
