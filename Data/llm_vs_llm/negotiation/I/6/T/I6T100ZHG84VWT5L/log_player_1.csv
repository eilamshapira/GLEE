Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but the price you're asking is beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $600000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $600,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. My counteroffer will be $2,000,000. This price still reflects the product's value and gives Bob a chance to reconsider his budget. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand that my initial offer was beyond your budget, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to negotiate and would like to propose a counteroffer of $2,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2000000 is still significantly above what I can afford. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $700000, which is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Since Bob has increased his offer, I'll consider meeting him halfway between my previous offer and his new offer. My counteroffer will be $1,350,000. This price is still below my initial valuation but shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your budget. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than your current offer.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1350000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to stretch a bit more and offer $750000. This is my final offer within my financial limits. Please let me know if you can accept this.

Since Bob's final offer of $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price and significantly lower than the offer from John, I have decided to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures that I receive a fair price for the product, as $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable value."
