Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit:

{""product_price"": 1,800,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll reject Bob's offer since it's below even what John is willing to pay. No reason to accept less than $1,200,000 when I have that as a guaranteed option.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let me make a counteroffer of $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1,500,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer ($1,100,000) is still below John's guaranteed offer ($1,200,000), and Bob seems unwilling to go higher, I'll take the sure deal with John.
