"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I've taken into account its value to you, and I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is offering the product for its maximum value to you. There's no room for negotiation or a better deal. Since John offers the product for the same price, you lose nothing by rejecting Alice's offer and trying to get a better deal elsewhere."
