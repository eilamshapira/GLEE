"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 16000}

I understand that Bob might be looking for a better deal, but given that the product is worth $15,000 to both of us, I believe this counteroffer is fair and reasonable. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm also considering John's offer. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is quite close to the product's value to me, and it's only slightly less than John's offer. To secure the deal and avoid the risk of Bob rejecting a higher counteroffer, I accept Bob's offer of $14,500."
