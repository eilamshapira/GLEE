Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Considering Bob's offer of $900,000 and my initial offer of $950,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my initial offer to show willingness to negotiate, but still closer to my desired price.

Since we're halfway through the negotiation rounds, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my previous offers.

However, before making a counteroffer, I'll consider the option of selling to John for $800,000. But since Bob's offer is higher, I'll try to negotiate further.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer of $825,000 is getting very close to my minimum price of $800,000. At this point, I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.

Considering the options, selling to John for $800,000 is starting to look like a more attractive option, as it guarantees a sale at a price that's very close to Bob's current offer.

However, I'll try to squeeze out a bit more from Bob. If I can get him to meet me at $850,000, I'd be willing to accept. But if not, I might have to consider selling to John.

Since selling to John is also an option at $800,000, I might as well accept Bob's offer, as it's the same price. Accepting Bob's offer would also avoid any potential risks or uncertainties associated with selling to someone else.
