"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the perceived value, $200 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay up to $80.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be out of your budget, but $80 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I can offer you the product for $180. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the adjusted price, but $180 is still too high for me. I could go up to $95, but that's my absolute limit.  If we can't agree on that, I'll have to consider other options.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that $180 is still out of your budget, and I'm trying to be flexible. However, $95 is below my minimum acceptable price. I can offer you the product for $110, which is a significant compromise on my part. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",110.0,Alice,5,
