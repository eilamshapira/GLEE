Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the perceived value, $200 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay up to $80.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually agreeable price. My counteroffer will be $180. This is lower than my initial offer but still reflects the product's value to me. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be out of your budget, but $80 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I can offer you the product for $180. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the adjusted price, but $180 is still too high for me. I could go up to $95, but that's my absolute limit.  If we can't agree on that, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a price that works for both of us. Since Bob's limit is $95 and I have a minimum acceptable price of $120, I'll try to meet him halfway. My next counteroffer will be $110, which is still below my minimum but closer to Bob's limit.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that $180 is still out of your budget, and I'm trying to be flexible. However, $95 is below my minimum acceptable price. I can offer you the product for $110, which is a significant compromise on my part. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 110}"
