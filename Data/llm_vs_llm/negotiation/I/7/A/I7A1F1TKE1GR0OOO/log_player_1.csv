Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer to Bob that's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, leaving room for potential negotiation while still aiming for a good profit.

{""product_price"": 1,500,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $1,200,000, there's no reason to accept Bob's current offer. I also don't see value in continuing negotiations with Bob since his initial counteroffer is significantly below my minimum price.
