"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is still quite high (close to John's price of $15,000), and knowing that the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's significant room for negotiation. It's only the first round, so I should try to negotiate for a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's worth for the product is $8,000 and offered $14,000, I'll make a counteroffer significantly lower to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be unreasonable.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price by $1,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, given that the product is worth $8,000 to her, there's still room for a better deal. Since we're only in round 3 out of 10, I'll continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $14,000 to $13,000, I'll increase my previous offer but still maintain a good margin for negotiation.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has now reduced her price to $12,500, showing continued willingness to negotiate. While this is better, we're only halfway through our negotiation rounds, and there's still a significant gap between her cost ($8,000) and this offer. I'll continue negotiating for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has been moving down in smaller increments ($500 last time), so I'll adjust my strategy and increase my offer with a similar smaller increment to show good faith in the negotiation.
