"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given the quality and market value of this product, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential value."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I agree your product has potential, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 (John's offer), so I cannot accept it. However, there's still room for negotiation to find a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I must inform you that I have another offer of $1,200,000 for this product. While I'd prefer to work with you, I cannot accept anything below that amount. However, I'm willing to adjust my initial asking price. I can offer you the product for $1,700,000, which is a $300,000 reduction from my initial offer and represents good value given the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for clarifying. While that other offer is interesting, I'm not quite there yet. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000?  This demonstrates my serious interest while recognizing the value you hold. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,250,000. This is a reasonable price that exceeds John's guaranteed offer by $50,000, and continuing the negotiation might risk losing both opportunities. Bob has shown good faith by moving significantly up from his initial offer, and this price provides a satisfactory profit margin above my minimum acceptable price."
