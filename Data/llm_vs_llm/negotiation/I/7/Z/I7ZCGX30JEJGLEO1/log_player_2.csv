"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the offer from Alice ($1,500,000) is above my maximum budget of $1,000,000, it doesn't make sense to accept it. Additionally, buying from John for $1,000,000 is within my budget, but I'd like to try negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price that's lower than $1,000,000. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range, considering my maximum budget is $1,000,000. Let's start with a counteroffer of $750,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,400,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. Since I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within my budget, I don't see a reason to accept Alice's offer. However, I'd like to continue negotiating to see if Alice is willing to lower the price further.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer. This time, I'll increase my previous offer slightly to show that I'm willing to compromise, but still try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new counteroffer is: $850,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,300,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. At this point, I've made a few counteroffers, and Alice has consistently come back with prices that are too high. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within my budget and a better deal than anything Alice has offered so far, I think it's time to stop negotiating with Alice.
