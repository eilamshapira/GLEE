"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my premium product to you for $20000. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's offer of $20,000 is above the maximum value the product is worth to me ($15,000). Since John is willing to sell the identical product for $15,000, and Alice's initial offer exceeds this price, the rational decision would be to either make a counteroffer to Alice or buy from John directly.

Given that John's offer is already at my maximum valuation, there's no guarantee Alice would accept a counteroffer below $15,000, and negotiating further would only be worthwhile if I could get a better price than John's.
