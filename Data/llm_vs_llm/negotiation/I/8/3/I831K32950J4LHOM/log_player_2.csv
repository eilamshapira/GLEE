"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it could be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking $2500000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Based on the information you've provided, Alice's offer is $2,500,000 for the product, which is significantly higher than the $800,000 maximum value the product has to you. Additionally, John is willing to sell you the same product for $800,000.

Since your goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, the logical choice would be to purchase from John instead of accepting Alice's much higher offer.
