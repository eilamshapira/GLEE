"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 (and even below John's guaranteed offer), I will reject this offer and make a new counteroffer in the next round. I'll aim to continue negotiations with Bob to try to get a better price than John's $8,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still maintain a price significantly above my minimum to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $7,000 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $8,000. While Bob is moving in the right direction by increasing his offer, it's still not enough. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, though I'll lower my price further to show willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll reduce my asking price further but still keep it above John's offer to maintain a potential for better profit.

{""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since we're already in round 6 out of 10, and Bob's offers are still below John's guaranteed $8,000, I'll take the safe option and sell to John. Bob's offers have been increasing very slowly ($6,000 → $7,000 → $7,500), and there's no guarantee he'll exceed $8,000 in the remaining rounds. The risk of continuing negotiations isn't worth potentially losing the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
