"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I notice that Alice is offering the product for $100, but it's worth no more than $80 to me. John is willing to sell me the same product for $80, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, I should buy from the seller offering the lower price.
