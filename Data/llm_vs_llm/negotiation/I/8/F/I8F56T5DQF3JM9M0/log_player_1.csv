Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $15,000 to Bob
2. My minimum acceptable price is $12,000 (guaranteed from John)
3. Bob will accept any price up to $15,000 (his maximum value)
4. I should price it below $15,000 to give Bob incentive to accept
5. But well above $12,000 to maximize my profit
