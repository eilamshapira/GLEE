"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Looking at the options:

1. Alice is offering the product for $14,500
2. If I reject Alice's offer, I'd need to buy from John for $15,000
3. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me

Since Alice's offer ($14,500) is less than John's price ($15,000), I should accept Alice's offer to save $500.
