"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8000. I believe this is a fair price, considering my budget constraints.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is significantly below my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $10000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide immense value.",10000.0,Alice,3,
