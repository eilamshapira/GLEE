"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to tell you about the product I'm selling. It's truly one of a kind and I believe it could be incredibly valuable to you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $12000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since the offer of $12,000 is above my budget of $10,000, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still shows that I'm interested in the product. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a relatively low offer.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is significantly below my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $10000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide immense value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's new offer of $10,000 is exactly the same price that John is offering, and I don't have any additional information that would make Alice's product more valuable to me, I will choose to buy the product from John for $10,000. This way, I can get the product at the same price without having to continue negotiating with Alice.
