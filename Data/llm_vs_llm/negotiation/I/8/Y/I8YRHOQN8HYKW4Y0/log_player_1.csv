Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a fair price to offer to Bob. Since I don't know how much the product is worth to Bob, I need to balance between setting a price that Bob might accept while maximizing my profits.

The product is worth at least $80 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at exactly $80. This means $80 is my absolute minimum acceptable price - my reservation value.

I should offer Bob a price higher than $80 to try to make more profit than my guaranteed alternative. However, if I set the price too high, Bob might reject it.

A reasonable approach would be to set a moderately higher price than my minimum - perhaps around $120. This gives Bob room to get value if the product is worth more to him, while giving me a better return than my guaranteed alternative.
