"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think would be perfect for you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. I think it's a great product, but the price of $200 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I can't accept $120 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. Given the product's quality and value, I can offer it to you for $175. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's worth.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for reducing the price to $175. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better deal. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $140. I believe this is a reasonable price, and I'm hoping we can meet at this point.",140.0,Bob,4,
