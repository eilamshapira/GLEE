Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think would be perfect for you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. I think it's a great product, but the price of $200 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: I will reject Bob's offer of $120 because:
1. The product is worth at least $150 to me
2. I know Bob values the product at $150
3. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $150
4. Bob's offer of $120 is below both my minimum acceptable price and his own valuation
I'll make a new counteroffer to try to get a better price, knowing I can always fall back on John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I can't accept $120 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. Given the product's quality and value, I can offer it to you for $175. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 175}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for reducing the price to $175. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better deal. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $140. I believe this is a reasonable price, and I'm hoping we can meet at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Reasoning: I'll choose to sell to John because:
1. John's offer of $150 is better than Bob's current offer of $140
2. While we could continue negotiating with Bob, there's no guarantee he'll increase his offer significantly
3. Bob's offer trajectory ($120 â†’ $140) suggests he might not go much higher, if at all
4. The guaranteed $150 from John is a safe and profitable option
5. This is the most rational economic decision given I know John's firm offer of $150 and Bob's demonstrated resistance to higher prices"
