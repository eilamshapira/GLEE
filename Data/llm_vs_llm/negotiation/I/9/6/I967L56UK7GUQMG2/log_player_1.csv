Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand budget considerations, but I must point out that $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price for this product. Its actual value and my costs prevent me from going that low. However, I'm willing to work with you on the price. I can offer it for $16,500, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 16500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $16500 is still above my budget. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I need to stay within my budget.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, I need to be transparent that I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at $12,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. My absolute minimum price is $13,000, which is still a substantial discount from my initial offer and reflects the true value of this high-quality product. This is very close to my bottom line, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price point."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
