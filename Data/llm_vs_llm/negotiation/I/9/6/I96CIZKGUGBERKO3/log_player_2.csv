"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offer ($120) is equal to John's price ($120)
2. Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, there's room for negotiation
3. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate a better price
4. There's no risk in making a counteroffer since I can always fall back to John's offer

Given these factors, I should reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price with Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low but reasonable offer. Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, I'll offer a price that gives her some profit but is significantly better for me than $120.

{""product_price"": 105}

This offer would give Alice a $5 profit while saving me $15 compared to both Alice's initial offer and John's price. It's low enough to leave room for negotiation but not so low as to be offensive or unreasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has dropped her price by $5, showing she's willing to negotiate. The new offer of $115 is better than John's price ($120), but there might still be room for a better deal. Since I still have 7 more rounds and Alice has shown flexibility, I should try one more counter.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $120 to $115, and rejected my $105 offer, I'll try to meet closer to the middle. I'll offer $110, which is a fair compromise between her $115 and my previous $105 offer. This would still give her a $10 profit while saving me $10 compared to John's price.
