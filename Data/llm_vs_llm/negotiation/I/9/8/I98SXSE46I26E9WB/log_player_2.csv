"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at $1500000. This is a top-quality item that I believe matches its value, and I’m confident it will perfectly serve your needs. Let me know if this offer works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's initial offer is at the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,500,000), and I have the option to buy the product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in accepting Alice's offer immediately. However, I also don't want to give up on the potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to negotiate a lower price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $1,500,000 and I know that I can buy the product from John for the same price, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. This will give us room to negotiate and potentially find a mutually agreeable price.

My counteroffer will be $1,000,000. This is a price that I believe is fair and reflects the value I place on the product.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. Given the quality and value of the product, I'm proposing $1400000. This price reflects both the market value and the premium quality you’re getting. Let me know if we can proceed on these terms. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has made a counteroffer of $1,400,000, which is $100,000 less than her initial offer. This shows that she is willing to negotiate, but still wants to get a high price for the product.

I'm still interested in buying the product, but I don't want to pay more than I have to. Since Alice's offer is still $400,000 more than my initial counteroffer of $1,000,000, I think there's still room for negotiation.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer. This time, I'll try to meet her halfway between my initial counteroffer and her current offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To make a counteroffer, I'll consider the current state of the negotiation. Alice's last offer was $1,400,000, and my previous counteroffer was $1,000,000. I'll try to find a middle ground that is still favorable to me.

A possible middle ground could be around $1,200,000, which is the average of $1,000,000 and $1,400,000. However, since I know that I can buy the product from John for $1,500,000, and Alice's reserve price is likely lower than her offers, I'll aim a bit lower.

My counteroffer will be $1,100,000. This price is still lower than Alice's last offer, but higher than my initial counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
