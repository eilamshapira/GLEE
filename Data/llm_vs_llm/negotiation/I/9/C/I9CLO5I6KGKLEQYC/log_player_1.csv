Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a somewhat high offer to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit.

{""product_price"": 1,400,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Given that Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than John's fixed offer of $1,000,000, and while it's lower than my initial ask, it still represents a good profit above my minimum value of $1,000,000. However, since Bob has shown willingness to negotiate and there might be room to get a better price, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still try to secure a better deal than Bob's $1,200,000 offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob has lowered his offer from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, which shows he's moving in the wrong direction. While $1,100,000 is still better than John's $1,000,000 offer, Bob's downward movement in price suggests he might not be negotiating in good faith. I'll reject this offer and make one final counteroffer, but if Bob continues to decrease his price, I may need to reconsider my strategy.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Given that Bob has shown a pattern of decreasing his offers, I'll adjust my price closer to his last offer of $1,100,000, but still try to secure a better deal than that.
