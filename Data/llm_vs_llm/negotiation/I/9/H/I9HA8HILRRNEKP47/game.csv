"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is significantly above my budget and what I believe is fair market value for this product. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $150. However, I'd like to work with you and would offer $120 for the product, which I believe is a reasonable starting point for our negotiation.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to work together. However, I must consider the product's value and my minimum requirements. Given that you mentioned the product is available elsewhere for $150, I'm willing to make a concession. I'll offer the product to you for $180, which is still a competitive price considering the product's quality and our direct transaction.",180.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but I need to be frank - I can get this product from John for $150, and that's actually the maximum I'm willing to pay. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $135, which saves me some money while still giving you a fair deal.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your honesty about your maximum budget. I appreciate your willingness to make a deal with me. Considering your constraints, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer the product to you for $145, which is a fair price considering the product's value and the convenience of our direct transaction. This way, you'll still save $5 compared to buying from John, and I'll get a slightly better deal than my minimum requirement.",145.0,Alice,5,
