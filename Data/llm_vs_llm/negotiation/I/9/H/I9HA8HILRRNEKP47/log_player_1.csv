"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its exceptional quality and value, I'm starting with a competitive price. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is significantly above my budget and what I believe is fair market value for this product. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $150. However, I'd like to work with you and would offer $120 for the product, which I believe is a reasonable starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob mentioned that he knows the product can be obtained elsewhere for $150 and is still willing to negotiate, I believe there's room for a better offer. I'll reject his current offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to or above $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to work together. However, I must consider the product's value and my minimum requirements. Given that you mentioned the product is available elsewhere for $150, I'm willing to make a concession. I'll offer the product to you for $180, which is still a competitive price considering the product's quality and our direct transaction."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but I need to be frank - I can get this product from John for $150, and that's actually the maximum I'm willing to pay. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $135, which saves me some money while still giving you a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob is willing to pay up to $150 and is trying to negotiate a better deal, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his current offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to the $150 he's willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your honesty about your maximum budget. I appreciate your willingness to make a deal with me. Considering your constraints, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer the product to you for $145, which is a fair price considering the product's value and the convenience of our direct transaction. This way, you'll still save $5 compared to buying from John, and I'll get a slightly better deal than my minimum requirement."", ""product_price"": 145}"
