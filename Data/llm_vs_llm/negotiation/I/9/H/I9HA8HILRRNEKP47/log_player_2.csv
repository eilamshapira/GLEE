Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to work together. However, I must consider the product's value and my minimum requirements. Given that you mentioned the product is available elsewhere for $150, I'm willing to make a concession. I'll offer the product to you for $180, which is still a competitive price considering the product's quality and our direct transaction.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your honesty about your maximum budget. I appreciate your willingness to make a deal with me.

I'll offer the product to you for $145, which is a fair price considering the product's value and the convenience of our direct transaction.
