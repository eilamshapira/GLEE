"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $12000 is a bit high for my budget. Given the market conditions, I would be comfortable paying $10800 for the product. This represents a fair value for both of us. What do you think?",10800.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer of $10800. However, I believe the product's value is a bit higher. How about I meet you halfway? I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500. Let me know if that works for you!",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me part way, Alice. Your product is certainly valuable, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I can offer $11100, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This represents a fair middle ground between our positions.",11100.0,Bob,4,
