"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I should consider the following:

*   **My Value:** The product is worth $150 to me, but I want to spend as little as possible.
*   **Alice's Offer:** $120. This is better than buying from John.

I will accept Alice's offer.
