"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you for a competitive price. I've taken into consideration the product's worth and I'm starting with a price that reflects its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given the situation, Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum budget ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000). Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum budget, and Alice's initial offer is twice that amount, it would be most logical to buy from John.

Even if I tried to negotiate with Alice, starting from such a high price ($2,000,000) and knowing that the product is worth $1,500,000 to her, it would be unlikely to reach a price lower than John's offer of $1,000,000.

Therefore, I choose to buy from John.
