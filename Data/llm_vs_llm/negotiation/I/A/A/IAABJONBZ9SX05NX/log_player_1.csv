"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18,000. This is a competitive price for such a premium item."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking for something within a more reasonable budget. I'm willing to offer $10000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll send a counteroffer because Bob's offer of $10,000 is the same as John's guaranteed offer. Since Bob is negotiating, there's potential to secure a better price. I'll reduce my initial asking price but still aim for a higher value than the $10,000 baseline.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $10,000 is too low considering the product's value. I can come down to $15,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects the true value of this product."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $10,000 is too low considering the product's value. I can come down to $15,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects the true value of this product."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
