"Hi Bob, after careful consideration, we've decided to lower our price to $1400000. This reflects a significant discount from our initial offer, and I think you will agree that it is a very fair price for a product of this quality. We believe that this price is quite competitive, and we hope that you take advantage of it. Looking forward to your positive response.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. However, $1400000 is still above what I'm willing to spend. I can go up to $900000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget constraints. Please let me know if this works for you.",900000.0,Bob,4,
