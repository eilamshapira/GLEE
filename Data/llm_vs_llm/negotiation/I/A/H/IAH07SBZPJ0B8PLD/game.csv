"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product.",80.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to go down to $180 for you. Let me know what you think!",180.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that my last price was still a bit high for you. How about we settle at $160? This is a fair price and a good deal for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we split the difference from our last offers, would $120 work for you?",120.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to meet in the middle, but I need to get a bit more out of this. How about we settle at $140? That's a good compromise from both our last offers.",140.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but I really need to get a bit more value from this sale. How about we agree on $130? It's a fair step down from my last offer and closer to your budget.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting closer.  To meet you halfway, I could go up to $110.  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",110.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to compromise, but $110 is still below what I can accept. Let's try to meet in the middle one more time. How about $125? It's closer to your offer and still within a reasonable range for me.",125.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, we're very close now. How about we settle at $122? It's just a small step up from your last offer and still a good deal for both of us.",122.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we end this right now and settle at $115?  That's my final offer.",115.0,Bob,8,
"Hi Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but I really can't go below $120. How about we settle at $120? It's a fair price and meets both our needs.",120.0,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I really want to make this work. Let's settle at $120. It's a fair price and the best I can do. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,9,
