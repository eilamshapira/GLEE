"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it at a competitive price of $180. This is a quality product that I'm confident you'll find worthwhile. If you're interested, please let me know. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to make a decision about buying this product.

The key information:
- The product is worth no more than $150 to me
- Alice is offering it for $180
- John is willing to sell it for $150

Since the product is only worth $150 to me at most, paying $180 would not be a good decision. I would be paying more than the value I'd receive.

John's offer matches exactly the maximum value of the product to me, so it's a reasonable option.
