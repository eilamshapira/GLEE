"Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you today. I'm selling it for $200. This is a fair market price for this item, and I believe you'll find it valuable. Are you interested?",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can get a similar product elsewhere for $120. I would like to offer $90 for your product, which I believe is a fair price considering the market alternatives.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $90 is below my minimum acceptable price. You mentioned similar products at $120, but I believe my product offers superior quality and value. I can come down to $160, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This reflects both the true value of the product and my desire to work with you. What do you say?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $160 is still more than I can justify spending. I know I can get the product from another seller for $120, so I need a better price to choose your product instead. I can offer $100, which gives you a fair profit while being competitive with other market options.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be clear that my product's minimum value is $120. That's actually the same price you mentioned for alternatives on the market. Given that my product is of high quality, I can offer it to you for $140, which is a fair price considering its value. This is my best offer that still allows me some profit margin while providing you with a quality product. Would you consider meeting me at this price?",140.0,Alice,5,
