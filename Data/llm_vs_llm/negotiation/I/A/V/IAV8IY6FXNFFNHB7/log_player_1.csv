Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you today. I'm selling it for $200. This is a fair market price for this item, and I believe you'll find it valuable. Are you interested?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can get a similar product elsewhere for $120. I would like to offer $90 for your product, which I believe is a fair price considering the market alternatives. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $90 is below my minimum acceptable price. You mentioned similar products at $120, but I believe my product offers superior quality and value. I can come down to $160, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This reflects both the true value of the product and my desire to work with you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 160}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $160 is still more than I can justify spending. I know I can get the product from another seller for $120, so I need a better price to choose your product instead. I can offer $100, which gives you a fair profit while being competitive with other market options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be clear that my product's minimum value is $120. That's actually the same price you mentioned for alternatives on the market. Given that my product is of high quality, I can offer it to you for $140, which is a fair price considering its value. This is my best offer that still allows me some profit margin while providing you with a quality product. Would you consider meeting me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
