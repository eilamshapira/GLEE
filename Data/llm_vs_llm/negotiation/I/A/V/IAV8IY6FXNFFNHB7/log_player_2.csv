"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you today. I'm selling it for $200. This is a fair market price for this item, and I believe you'll find it valuable. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is significantly higher than my maximum value of $120, and even higher than John's price. It makes sense to reject and make a counteroffer closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can get a similar product elsewhere for $120. I would like to offer $90 for your product, which I believe is a fair price considering the market alternatives."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $90 is below my minimum acceptable price. You mentioned similar products at $120, but I believe my product offers superior quality and value. I can come down to $160, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This reflects both the true value of the product and my desire to work with you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $160 is still above my maximum value of $120, and it's also higher than John's price. Even though Alice reduced the price, it's still not within my acceptable range. I should reject and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $160 is still more than I can justify spending. I know I can get the product from another seller for $120, so I need a better price to choose your product instead. I can offer $100, which gives you a fair profit while being competitive with other market options."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be clear that my product's minimum value is $120. That's actually the same price you mentioned for alternatives on the market. Given that my product is of high quality, I can offer it to you for $140, which is a fair price considering its value. This is my best offer that still allows me some profit margin while providing you with a quality product. Would you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice has stated that her minimum price is $120 (the same as John's price) and her current offer of $140 is still above my maximum value of $120, it's best to buy from John. Alice has indicated she won't go below $120, so continuing to negotiate would be futile, and we'd risk wasting more rounds without reaching a better deal than John's offer."
