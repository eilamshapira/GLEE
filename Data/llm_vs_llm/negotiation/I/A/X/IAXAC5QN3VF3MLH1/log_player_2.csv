"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for sale. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice first. $180 is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $120. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $120 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice met our alternative price. It's not worth risking a higher counteroffer since John will sell it for the same price."
