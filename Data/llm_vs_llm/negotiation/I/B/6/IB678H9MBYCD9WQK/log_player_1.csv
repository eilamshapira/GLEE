Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. I'm aware of market prices for similar products, and I have other options available around $800000. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. Would you consider $700000 for the product?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $1100000 is still well above my budget. I understand the value of your product, but I have a firm budget constraint and a reliable alternative offer at $800000. To make this work, I can offer $750000, which is higher than my initial offer. This represents the maximum I can stretch my budget while still making business sense for me.
