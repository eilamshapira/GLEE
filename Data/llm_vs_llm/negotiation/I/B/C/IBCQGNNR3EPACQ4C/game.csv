"Alice,  $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't justify that price. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it,  a price that reflects its fair market value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe the value of the product is worth more than $1000000. I can offer it to you at a more competitive price of $1750000. This adjustment still ensures that you are getting great value, while also reflecting the unique qualities of the product.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  However, $1750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to pay $1375000 for the product,  which is a fair price for both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
