"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $10000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. Given the product's value, I can offer it to you for $13500. This is a reduction from my initial offer and represents good value for the quality you're getting.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is my best offer, considering my budget constraints. Let me know if you can accept this price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
