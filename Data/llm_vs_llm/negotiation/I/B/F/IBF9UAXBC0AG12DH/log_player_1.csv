Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it for $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Since Bob's offer is too low, I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. I know I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I won't accept anything below that from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $10,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. Given the product's value, I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is a reduction from my initial offer and represents good value for the quality you're getting."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is my best offer, considering my budget constraints. Let me know if you can accept this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's highest offer is $11,000, which is still below what John is willing to pay ($12,000), and Bob indicates this is his best offer, it makes the most financial sense to sell to John. There's no point in continuing negotiations with Bob if he can't exceed $12,000."
