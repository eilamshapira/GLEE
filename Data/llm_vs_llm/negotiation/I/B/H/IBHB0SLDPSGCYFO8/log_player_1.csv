Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that the product is worth $15,000 to Bob and $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I should offer a price that maximizes my profit while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept. Since Bob has room between my minimum ($10,000) and his maximum value ($15,000), I'll set the price closer to his maximum value while leaving some benefit for him to incentivize acceptance.

{""product_price"": 13500}

This price gives Bob $1,500 in value ($15,000 - $13,500) while giving me a good profit of $3,500 above my minimum price. If Bob rejects this, I still have John's guaranteed offer of $10,000."
