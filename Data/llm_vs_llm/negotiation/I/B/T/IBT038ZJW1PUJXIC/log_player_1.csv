"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is higher than my minimum price of $800,000 and leaves room for further negotiation, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

My counteroffer is: $1,400,000

I'm hoping to meet somewhere in the middle, but closer to my desired price.

I'm trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us.

My next counteroffer is: $1,250,000

I'm trying to find a price that is more reasonable considering the product's value to Bob.

Accepting $850,000 is better than selling to John for $800,000, and it's also better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking him walking away.
