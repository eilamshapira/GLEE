"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I think we can get this done.  Let's go with $155. That's as low as I can reasonably go and still feel like I'm getting a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's unlikely Alice will come down significantly from $155, and I'm not willing to go any higher. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for the guaranteed best price."
