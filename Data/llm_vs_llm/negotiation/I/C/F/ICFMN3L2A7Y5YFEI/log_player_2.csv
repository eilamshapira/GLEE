"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you are interested in purchasing the product. I believe it would be a valuable addition for you. I am offering it to you for $15000, its full value. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $15,000, it's not a good deal for me. I will reject Alice's offer and consider buying the product from John for $8,000, which is within my budget."
