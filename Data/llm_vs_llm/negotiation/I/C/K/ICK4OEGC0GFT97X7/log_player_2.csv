"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given the details:
- The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
- Alice's offer is $10,000
- John's fixed price is $12,000
- Alice's cost is $8,000

Alice's offer of $10,000 is already better than John's price of $12,000, saving me $2,000. However, since Alice's cost is $8,000, there might be room for negotiation to get an even better price. It makes sense to reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives us both some value while trying to save money.

{""product_price"": $8,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price from $10,000 to $9,500, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is already $2,500 less than John's price, but I think there's still room to negotiate since her cost is $8,000. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $9,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price further to $9,200, which is a $300 reduction from her previous offer of $9,500. We're making progress in the negotiation, and this price is already $2,800 less than John's price. 

Since we're now in round 5 of 10, and Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by dropping her price multiple times, I'll accept this offer to secure the deal at a good price.
