"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product to offer you. Based on my market research and the product's features, I'm offering it at $1800000. This is a premium product with excellent value, and I believe it's a fair price considering its quality and potential benefits.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the quality of your product, but the price you're asking is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. Let me know if we can work with this figure.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $1000000 is significantly below the product's value. My absolute minimum is $1500000, which represents the current market value of the product. I already have another potential buyer willing to pay this amount, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Perhaps we can meet at this price point, which is already $300000 less than my initial offer.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1500000 is still above what I'm willing to pay. I can go up to $1100000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. I hope we can find a middle ground here.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but I need to be transparent with you. The product is worth no less than $1500000 to me, and I already have John willing to pay exactly that amount. I understand this may be above your budget, but I cannot go below $1500000 as it would result in a loss for me. If you can meet me at $1500000, we can close the deal; otherwise, I'll need to accept John's offer.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
