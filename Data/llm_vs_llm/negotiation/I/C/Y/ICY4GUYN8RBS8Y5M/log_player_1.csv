Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product to offer you. Based on my market research and the product's features, I'm offering it at $1,800,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the quality of your product, but the price you're asking is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. Let me know if we can work with this figure. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's value. My absolute minimum is $1,500,000, which represents the current market value of the product. I already have another potential buyer willing to pay this amount, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Perhaps we can meet at this price point, which is already $300,000 less than my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but I need to be transparent with you. The product is worth no less than $1,500,000 to me, and I already have John willing to pay exactly that amount. I understand this may be above your budget, but I cannot go below $1,500,000 as it would result in a loss for me. If you can meet me at $1,500,000, we can close the deal; otherwise, I'll need to accept John's offer."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
