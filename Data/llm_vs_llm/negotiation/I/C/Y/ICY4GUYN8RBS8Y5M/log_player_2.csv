Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $1000000 is significantly below the product's value. My absolute minimum is $1500000, which represents the current market value of the product. I already have another potential buyer willing to pay this amount, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Perhaps we can meet at this price point, which is already $300000 less than my initial offer.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but I need to be transparent with you. The product is worth no less than $1500000 to me, and I already have John willing to pay exactly that amount. I understand this may be above your budget, but I cannot go below $1500000 as it would result in a loss for me. If you can meet me at $1500000, we can close the deal; otherwise, I'll need to accept John's offer.
