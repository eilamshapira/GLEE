"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it for $25000. This price reflects the product's exceptional quality and market value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's quite a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. I was thinking of a price around $5000. Would you be willing to sell at this price?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $5000 is significantly below the product's value. While I can be somewhat flexible on the price, I need to ensure I receive fair value. I can offer it to you for $21000, which is already a reduction from my initial price. This product's quality and market value justify this price point. Would you consider this offer?",21000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Alice, but $21000 is still a bit steep for me. Could we meet in the middle at $8000? I believe this price point aligns better with my budget while still recognizing the product's value. What are your thoughts?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob, but $8000 is still significantly below what I can accept. Given that I have another interested buyer, I need to be transparent - I cannot go below $18000. This is already a substantial reduction from my initial asking price and reflects the true value of the product. Would you be able to meet me at this price?",18000.0,Alice,5,
