Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it for $25,000. This price reflects the product's exceptional quality and market value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's quite a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. I was thinking of a price around $5000. Would you be willing to sell at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $5,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 (which is what John is willing to pay). However, there might be room for negotiation to reach a better price with Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, coming down from my initial price but still maintaining a profitable margin."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $5,000 is significantly below the product's value. While I can be somewhat flexible on the price, I need to ensure I receive fair value. I can offer it to you for $21,000, which is already a reduction from my initial price. This product's quality and market value justify this price point. Would you consider this offer?"", ""product_price"": 21000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice, but $21000 is still a bit steep for me. Could we meet in the middle at $8000? I believe this price point aligns better with my budget while still recognizing the product's value. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $8,000 is still well below my guaranteed option of $15,000 from John. While Bob is showing some flexibility by increasing his offer, the gap is still too large. I'll make another counteroffer, but if we can't get closer to a price that exceeds John's offer, I'll need to consider taking John's guaranteed $15,000."
