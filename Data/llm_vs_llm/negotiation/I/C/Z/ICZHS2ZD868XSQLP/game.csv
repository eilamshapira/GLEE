,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $5000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your response, but $5000 is significantly lower than what I can accept for the product. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to offer it to you for $17000. I believe it's a fair deal considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts!",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $17000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $7000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand budget constraints, but unfortunately, I can't go as low as $7000. How about I offer it to you for $15000? That's the lowest I can go, and it's still a great deal for such a valuable product. Let me know if you're interested!",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to lower the price. However, $15000 is still a bit steep for me. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $8500. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still can't accept $8500. Based on the product's unique value, I can offer it to you for $12500. This is my best offer, and I genuinely believe it's a great investment. Let me know if this works for you!",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your latest offer. However, I'm still looking to get the best deal possible. Considering your offer of $12500, I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $9500. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",9500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued offers. However, I can't go as low as $9500. My final offer is $11000, which I believe reflects the true value of the product. I hope you can consider this offer seriously. Looking forward to your response!",11000.0,Alice,9,
