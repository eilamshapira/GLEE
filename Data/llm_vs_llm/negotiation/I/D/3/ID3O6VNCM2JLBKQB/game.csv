"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $8000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this item. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a better price. I can offer you $6500 for the product. This would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. What do you think?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to come down from my initial price, so how about we settle for $9200? This way, you'll still get a good deal compared to John's offer, and I'll also feel satisfied with the sale.",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. That's a step in the right direction, but I'm afraid it's still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, John is offering the same product for $8000, and that's actually my absolute ceiling for this purchase. If you can beat that price, I'd be happy to buy from you instead. I can offer $7200, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. Would that work for you?",7200.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your patience. I understand that you're looking for the best deal possible, and I'm willing to work with you on that. I can come down to $8600, which is quite close to John's offer. This way, you'll still get a better deal from me while allowing me to make a profitable sale. Let me know if we can settle at this price.",8600.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate and your latest offer of $8600. You've come down significantly from your initial price, which I really appreciate. However, I need to be direct - this product is worth a maximum of $8000 to me, which is exactly what John is offering. For me to choose you over John, I'd need a price below $8000. My final offer is $7500. This gives you a sale and gives me some savings compared to my alternative. If we can't agree on this, I'll need to go with John's offer. What do you say?",7500.0,Bob,6,
