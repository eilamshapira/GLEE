Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $8000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this item. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a better price. I can offer you $6500 for the product. This would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will offer Bob the product for $9200.

I decided to reject Bob's offer of $6,500 because it is significantly lower than my valuation of the product ($8,000) and also lower than John's offer. By counteroffering at $9,200, I am signaling to Bob that I am willing to negotiate but am holding firm on a price above my valuation. This price point also gives some wiggle room for further negotiation while still aiming to maximize my profit."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to come down from my initial price, so how about we settle for $9,200? This way, you'll still get a good deal compared to John's offer, and I'll also feel satisfied with the sale."", ""product_price"": 9200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. That's a step in the right direction, but I'm afraid it's still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, John is offering the same product for $8000, and that's actually my absolute ceiling for this purchase. If you can beat that price, I'd be happy to buy from you instead. I can offer $7200, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will offer Bob the product for $8600.

I decided to reject Bob's offer of $7,200 because it is still lower than my valuation of the product ($8,000) and also lower than John's offer. By counteroffering at $8,600, I am signaling to Bob that I am willing to negotiate but am holding firm on a price above my valuation. This price point also gives some wiggle room for further negotiation while still aiming to maximize my profit. Additionally, by coming down from my previous offer, I am showing Bob that I am serious about making a deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your patience. I understand that you're looking for the best deal possible, and I'm willing to work with you on that. I can come down to $8,600, which is quite close to John's offer. This way, you'll still get a better deal from me while allowing me to make a profitable sale. Let me know if we can settle at this price."", ""product_price"": 8600}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate and your latest offer of $8600. You've come down significantly from your initial price, which I really appreciate. However, I need to be direct - this product is worth a maximum of $8000 to me, which is exactly what John is offering. For me to choose you over John, I'd need a price below $8000. My final offer is $7500. This gives you a sale and gives me some savings compared to my alternative. If we can't agree on this, I'll need to go with John's offer. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I decided to sell the product to John for $8,000 because Bob's final offer of $7,500 is still lower than my valuation of the product and also lower than John's offer. Given that Bob has indicated that he would choose John's offer if we can't agree on a price below $8,000, it makes the most financial sense for me to sell the product to John for $8,000 and ensure a profitable sale."
