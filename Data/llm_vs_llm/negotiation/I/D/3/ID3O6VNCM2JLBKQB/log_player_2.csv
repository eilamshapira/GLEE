"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $10000. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer of $10,000 exceeds the maximum value of $8,000 that the product is worth to me. Since John is offering the same product for $8,000, which matches my maximum valuation, I should either try to negotiate with Alice for a better price or buy from John.

Since I have the option to buy from John at any time, I'll try negotiating with Alice first to see if I can get a better deal than $8,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $8,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this item. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a better price. I can offer you $6,500 for the product. This would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 6500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to come down from my initial price, so how about we settle for $9200? This way, you'll still get a good deal compared to John's offer, and I'll also feel satisfied with the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has lowered her price from $10,000 to $9,200, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still above the $8,000 that John is offering and above my maximum valuation. Since I can get the same product from John for $8,000, I should either try to negotiate further with Alice or go with John's offer.

I'll continue negotiating with Alice to see if I can get her to lower her price below $8,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. That's a step in the right direction, but I'm afraid it's still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, John is offering the same product for $8,000, and that's actually my absolute ceiling for this purchase. If you can beat that price, I'd be happy to buy from you instead. I can offer $7,200, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 7200}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your patience. I understand that you're looking for the best deal possible, and I'm willing to work with you on that. I can come down to $8600, which is quite close to John's offer. This way, you'll still get a better deal from me while allowing me to make a profitable sale. Let me know if we can settle at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has lowered her price to $8,600, which shows continued willingness to negotiate. However, this is still $600 more than John's offer of $8,000. Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and John is offering exactly that price, Alice's current offer doesn't make financial sense for me.

I'll try one more round of negotiation to see if Alice will go below $8,000, but if not, I should take John's offer.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate and your latest offer of $8,600. You've come down significantly from your initial price, which I really appreciate. However, I need to be direct - this product is worth a maximum of $8,000 to me, which is exactly what John is offering. For me to choose you over John, I'd need a price below $8,000. My final offer is $7,500. This gives you a sale and gives me some savings compared to my alternative. If we can't agree on this, I'll need to go with John's offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 7500}"
