"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice is offering the product for $20,000, which exceeds the $10,000 maximum value the product has to me. John is willing to sell the same product for $10,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

Given that:
1. Alice's offer is twice what the product is worth to me
2. John's offer equals exactly what the product is worth to me
3. Even if I make a counteroffer to Alice, there's no guarantee we'll reach a price below $10,000

The rational choice is to buy from John rather than accept Alice's high offer or enter a potentially lengthy negotiation.
