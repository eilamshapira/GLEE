Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to think about this strategically. Bob values the product at $80, which is the same as my minimum acceptable value. If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell to John for $80.

Since Bob and I value the product equally at $80, if I offer exactly $80, Bob should be indifferent between accepting and rejecting (since he gains no surplus). Any price above $80 will likely be rejected, as Bob would be losing money.

Since I'm guaranteed $80 from John if Bob rejects, I should offer Bob exactly $80, which gives him no reason to accept but also no reason to reject.
