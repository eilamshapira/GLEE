"Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice is offering the product for $80 and John is also selling the product for $80, accepting Alice's offer is equivalent to buying from John. Therefore, it doesn't matter which one I choose.
