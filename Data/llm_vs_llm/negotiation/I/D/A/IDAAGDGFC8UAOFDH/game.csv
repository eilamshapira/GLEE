"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $50 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $200 for the product. Let me know if this works for you!",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $200. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $75 for the product. If this doesn't work for you, I'm afraid I might have to explore other options, like buying from John for $100.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to work within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, $75 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to go down to $175, which is my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider selling to John. Let me know what you decide!",175.0,Alice,5,
