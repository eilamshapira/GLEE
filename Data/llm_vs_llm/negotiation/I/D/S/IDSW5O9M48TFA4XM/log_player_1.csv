Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Given that the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and Bob's offer is significantly lower, I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a tough spot. Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. However, the offer is getting closer, and further negotiation might push the price above my minimum. But I also have the option to sell to John.

Considering the risk of further negotiation and the possibility that Bob's final offer may still be below my minimum, I will choose to sell to John.
