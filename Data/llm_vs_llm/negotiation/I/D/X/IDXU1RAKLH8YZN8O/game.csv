"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm more comfortable with $8000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $17000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and it reflects my desire to work with you. Let me know if this works for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for considering a discount, Alice. While I appreciate your offer, I still have budget constraints. How about we settle at $10000? I believe this could be a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $10000 simply isn't viable for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's work together to close this deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
