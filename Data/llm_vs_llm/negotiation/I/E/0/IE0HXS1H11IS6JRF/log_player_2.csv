"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you! I'm offering a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  Would you be interested in a price of $15000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
