,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $300 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $80. Would you be willing to consider that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $80 as it's significantly below the product's value. Given the quality and features of the product, I can offer it to you for $225, which is already a substantial reduction from my initial price. Would this work for you?",225.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $225 is still a bit high for me. How about $120? This is still a decent price for you and within my budget.",120.0,Bob,4,
