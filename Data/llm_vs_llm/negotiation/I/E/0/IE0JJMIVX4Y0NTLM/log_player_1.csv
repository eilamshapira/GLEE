Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $300. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 300}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $300 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $80. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $80 as it's significantly below the product's value. Given the quality and features of the product, I can offer it to you for $225, which is already a substantial reduction from my initial price. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 225}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $225 is still a bit high for me. How about $120? This is still a decent price for you and within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $120 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150, and we seem to be quite far apart in our valuations, I'll take the guaranteed $150 from John rather than continue negotiations that may not reach an acceptable price."
