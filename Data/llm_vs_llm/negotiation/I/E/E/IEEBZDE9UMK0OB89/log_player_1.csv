Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me start with a reasonably high price to leave room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer ($80) is below my minimum acceptable value ($100), and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $100, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, instead of making a counteroffer, it's more rational to take the guaranteed $100 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob, who has shown he's willing to offer below my minimum threshold.
