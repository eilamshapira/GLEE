"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000, considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the product's intrinsic value and its potential return on investment justify a higher price. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $875000.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle is a good idea, but I was thinking more along the lines of meeting in the middle between my previous offer and your initial offer. That would put us at $825000. I'm willing to go a bit higher than that, so I'll offer $850000.",850000.0,Bob,4,
