Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on an optimal price to offer Bob. If I price it too high, Bob might reject the offer, and I'll end up selling to John for $80. If I price it too low, I might be leaving money on the table.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I need to balance the risk of rejection with the potential for a higher profit. A reasonable approach would be to set a price significantly higher than my guaranteed $80 from John, but not so high that Bob is likely to reject it outright.
