"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject this offer because $2,000,000 is clearly above my maximum value of $1,000,000. It wouldn't make sense to accept this when I can buy from John for $1,000,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round that's below my maximum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 500000}

I'll offer $500,000, which is half of John's price. This gives room for negotiation while still being a reasonable price that would save me money compared to John's offer. If Alice rejects this, we can potentially meet somewhere in the middle, while still staying under my maximum value of $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject this offer because $1,500,000 is still above my maximum value of $1,000,000, and it's also higher than John's price of $1,000,000. It wouldn't make sense to accept this when I can get the product for less from John. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round that's below my maximum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'll increase my offer to $700,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer of $500,000, showing I'm willing to negotiate in good faith, but it still keeps the price well below both my maximum value and John's price. This leaves room for further negotiation while potentially being more attractive to Alice than my previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject this offer because $1,300,000 is still above both my maximum value of $1,000,000 and John's price. Alice has come down from her initial offer but not enough to make it worthwhile compared to buying from John. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, but if Alice doesn't come down significantly, I may need to consider taking John's offer soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 850000}

I'll increase my offer to $850,000. This is another significant step up from my previous offer of $700,000, showing I'm willing to continue negotiating in good faith. This price is still below both my maximum value and John's price, while potentially being more attractive to Alice. If Alice doesn't respond with a more reasonable counteroffer, I may need to consider taking John's offer in the next rounds as we're already at round 6 of 10."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $1,000,000. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer of $1,150,000 is still above both my maximum value and John's price
2. We've gone through 7 rounds, and Alice's offers are still consistently above John's price
3. While Alice has been coming down in price, the pace of reduction suggests we might not reach a price below $1,000,000 in the remaining rounds
4. There's a risk in continuing to negotiate when we have a guaranteed option at $1,000,000

It's better to secure the deal with John now rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome."
