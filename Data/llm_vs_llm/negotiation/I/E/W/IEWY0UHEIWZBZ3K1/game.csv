"Hello Bob, I'm offering you an excellent product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. While its market value is significant, I'm willing to offer it to you for $180. This is a competitive price given the quality and features of the product. Would you like to proceed with this purchase?",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is significantly above my budget. Given that I can get a similar product elsewhere for $100, I would be willing to pay $90 for your product. This would save you the hassle of finding another buyer. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is significantly below my minimum price point. The product is worth at least $150 to me based on its quality and market value. However, I understand budget concerns, so I'm willing to come down to $155, which is quite reasonable considering what you'd get. This is already below what I could get elsewhere, as I have another buyer willing to pay $150. Let me know if this works for you.",155.0,Alice,3,
