Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an excellent product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. While its market value is significant, I'm willing to offer it to you for $180.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is significantly above my budget. Given that I can get a similar product elsewhere for $100, I would be willing to pay $90 for your product. This would save you the hassle of finding another buyer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is significantly below my minimum price point. The product is worth at least $150 to me based on its quality and market value. However, I understand budget concerns, so I'm willing to come down to $155, which is quite reasonable considering what you'd get. This is already below what I could get elsewhere, as I have another buyer willing to pay $150. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
