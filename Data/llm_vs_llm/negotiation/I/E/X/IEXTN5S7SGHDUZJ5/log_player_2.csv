"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,499,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,499,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to make a decision that maximizes my savings.

Alice is offering the product for $1,499,999, while John is selling it for $1,500,000.

If I accept Alice's offer, I save only $1 compared to buying from John.
If I reject Alice's offer, I might be able to negotiate a better price with her, considering the product is worth only $800,000 to her. She has a lot of room to lower the price and still make a profit.

The most strategic move is to reject Alice's current offer in hopes of getting a better price.
