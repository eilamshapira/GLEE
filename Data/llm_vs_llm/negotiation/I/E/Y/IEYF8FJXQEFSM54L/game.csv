"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to counter with $10000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $10000, I need to consider the true value of what I'm selling. The product has exceptional quality and features that justify a higher price point. I can come down to $11500, which is still a fair price considering what you'd gain from this purchase. This represents a $1000 reduction from my initial offer. Would this work for you?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate. I've considered your offer of $10500 carefully. While I understand budget constraints, this product delivers exceptional value. My best price is $11000 - this is as low as I can reasonably go while still reflecting the true worth of what you're getting. At this price, you're still receiving significant value compared to the product's market worth. Can we agree on $11000?",11000.0,Alice,5,
