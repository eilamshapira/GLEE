Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $10000, I need to consider the true value of what I'm selling. The product has exceptional quality and features that justify a higher price point. I can come down to $11500, which is still a fair price considering what you'd gain from this purchase.
