Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 150}

Rationale: Since I know that:
1. The product is worth $150 minimum to me
2. Bob values the product at $100
3. I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150
4. Bob will only accept if the price is at or below his valuation ($100)

There's no reason for me to offer Bob a price below $150. If I offered any price above $100, Bob would reject it anyway (since it's above his valuation), and if I offered any price at or below $100, I would be losing money compared to selling to John at $150. Therefore, I might as well offer $150, knowing Bob will reject it, and then sell to John at $150."
