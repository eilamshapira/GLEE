Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept anything near that.  I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price, but still keeping it well above my minimum acceptable amount.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still too low. I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll try a counteroffer again, but I'm starting to feel like John might be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm starting to feel like I might be too stubborn.  I'm going to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. If not, I might be better off taking John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting frustrating. Bob is clearly not willing to negotiate seriously. I've dropped my price considerably, and he still isn't budging.  I'm tired of this back-and-forth, and John is offering a safe and reliable deal. I'm going to sell to John."
