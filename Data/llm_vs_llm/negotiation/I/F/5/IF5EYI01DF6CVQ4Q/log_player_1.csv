Send your offer to Bob.,"Since I know that I can sell the product to John for $15,000 (which is my minimum acceptable price), and Bob values the product at $8,000, it wouldn't make sense to start with a very low offer. I'll start with a price above Bob's valuation but below John's offer to see if there's any room for negotiation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is well below both my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and even his own valuation ($8,000), and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, it makes the most sense to sell to John rather than continue negotiating with Bob. The gap between Bob's valuation ($8,000) and my minimum price ($15,000) means we won't be able to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
