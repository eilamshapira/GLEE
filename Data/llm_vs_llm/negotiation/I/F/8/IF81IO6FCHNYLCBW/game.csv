"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product that we both know is worth $1000000. Given its value and the opportunity it represents, I'm looking to sell it for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but my budget is a little lower. How about $800000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $800000 is a good starting point, I cannot go that low. How about we settle on $1100000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product. Let me know your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. $1100000 is still higher than I'd like to go. My maximum is really $900000. Can we meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your patience, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. However, I can't go as low as $900000. How about we aim for $1050000? I believe itâ€™s a fair compromise between our positions. Looking forward to your response!",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! $1050000 is still a bit more than I was hoping for. John is offering it for $1000000. I'm willing to go to $950000 to do business with you. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued interest, Bob! While I understand your position, I can't accept $950000. How about we meet at $1000000? This would ensure you get the product without going through John. Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,7,
