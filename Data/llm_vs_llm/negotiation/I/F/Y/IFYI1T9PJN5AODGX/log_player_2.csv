{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget and what John is offering. I should make a counteroffer that's significantly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 500000
}
``` 

This is a starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still gives room to negotiate upwards if needed. My goal is to get the price as close to John's offer ($1,000,000) as possible without going over."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While Alice came down a bit, the offer is still much too high. I'll continue negotiating and see if I can get her closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still staying far below her asking price. It's important to let her counter before making any significant jumps."

Alice is coming down slowly, but her offer is still way above my budget. I'll need to signal I'm getting impatient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but I'm still significantly below Alice's last offer. This signals that I'm willing to negotiate but not at any cost. We're getting closer to John's price, and I need to be mindful of the shrinking negotiation window."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's price reductions are getting smaller.  It's getting close to the point where negotiating further might not be worth it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

This is a significant jump, but it might be necessary to push things along. We are running out of rounds, and I want to see if Alice is willing to make a substantial move."
