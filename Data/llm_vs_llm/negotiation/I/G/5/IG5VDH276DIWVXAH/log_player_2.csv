"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $1,000,000
2. Buy from John: $1,200,000

Alice's offer ($1,000,000) is less than John's price ($1,200,000) by $200,000. Since:
- The product is worth up to $1,200,000 to me
- Alice's offer is below my maximum value
- Alice's offer saves me $200,000 compared to buying from John

The logical choice is to accept Alice's offer as it provides the best value and saves me money.
