"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start the negotiation with Bob.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you at a price of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth, and I believe it would be a good investment for you."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your proposal, but I must inform you that the product is worth no more than $800000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for exactly $800000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need a better price. I'm willing to offer you $700000 for the product, which would give me some savings compared to my alternative option. How does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer and explanation. While I understand you have another option with John, I need to clarify something important: I know the product is worth $800,000 to you, and interestingly, I also have a buyer named John who is willing to pay me $800,000 for it. Given this situation, I cannot sell below my minimum of $800,000. However, I can offer you the product at exactly $800,000 - the same price you mentioned John is offering to you. This way, neither of us loses anything, and we can still do business together. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
