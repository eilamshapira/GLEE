"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you at a price of $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth, and I believe it would be a good investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's price of $950,000 is significantly higher than the $800,000 the product is worth to me, and it's also higher than John's offering price. There's no reason to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your proposal, but I must inform you that the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for exactly $800,000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need a better price. I'm willing to offer you $700,000 for the product, which would give me some savings compared to my alternative option. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer and explanation. While I understand you have another option with John, I need to clarify something important: I know the product is worth $800000 to you, and interestingly, I also have a buyer named John who is willing to pay me $800000 for it. Given this situation, I cannot sell below my minimum of $800000. However, I can offer you the product at exactly $800000 - the same price you mentioned John is offering to you. This way, neither of us loses anything, and we can still do business together. Does that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice is now offering the product at $800,000, which is the same price John is offering and the maximum value to me, I'm indifferent between buying from Alice or John. I might as well accept Alice's offer at this point.
