"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $150 is higher than my maximum valuation of $100, and also higher than John's price of $100. It would be better to either negotiate with Alice for a lower price or buy from John at $100. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 80}

I'll offer $80, which is below both John's price and Alice's cost. This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's price of $100. If Alice accepts, I'll save $20 compared to buying from John. If she counters, we can still negotiate towards a mutually beneficial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $140 is still significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($100) and John's price ($100). While Alice has reduced her price from $150 to $140, it's still not a good deal for me. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, as there's still room for negotiation. If we can't reach a reasonable price, I can always fall back on John's offer of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 85}

I'll slightly increase my previous offer to $85. This shows some willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price well below both my maximum valuation and John's price. This offer would allow Alice to make some profit (as her cost is $100) if she's willing to reduce her expectations, while giving me a better deal than John's price. If Alice rejects this offer, I still have several rounds to negotiate, or I can ultimately go with John's option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is gradually lowering her price (from $150 to $140 to $130), but $130 is still higher than both my maximum valuation and John's price of $100. There's no reason to accept this offer when I can buy from John for $100. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, as Alice seems to be showing flexibility in her pricing. However, if we can't reach a price below $100, I'll eventually go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 90}

I'll increase my offer to $90. This represents another step up from my previous offers of $80 and $85, showing continued willingness to negotiate. At $90, it would still give me a $10 savings compared to John's price, while being closer to Alice's cost of $100. Since Alice has been consistently lowering her price, this higher offer might encourage her to meet me at a price point that works for both of us. We still have a few rounds left for negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's offers, while decreasing ($150 → $140 → $130 → $120), are still above John's price of $100
2. Even if Alice continues to decrease her price by $10 each round, she won't reach $100 within the remaining rounds
3. Since the product is only worth $100 to me, and John offers it at exactly $100, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice
4. There's a risk of running out of rounds while trying to negotiate further

It's most rational to take John's guaranteed offer of $100 rather than continue this negotiation."
