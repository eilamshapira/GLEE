Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well. I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be of significant value to you. Based on my market research, this product is valued at $1,500,000 for someone with your specific needs and capabilities. I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1,350,000, which would provide you with $150,000 in immediate value. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, while also allowing me to receive appropriate compensation for this premium item.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in doing business with me. While I understand the value of your product, your initial price of $1350000 is quite high compared to your cost basis. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product, which provides you with a solid $100000 profit while giving me reasonable value as well. This represents a fair middle ground that benefits us both. I look forward to reaching an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your position, I need to clarify that my valuation isn't based solely on my cost basis but on the fair market value of the product. Given that this product is worth $1,500,000 to you, I'm offering you the opportunity to gain substantial value. I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000, which still provides you with $225,000 in immediate value. This is a competitive price that fairly balances both our interests. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1275000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. You're right that the product has value to me, but I also know we need to find a price that works for both of us. Your cost is $1000000, and while I understand you're looking for a fair profit, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. I can offer $1175000, which provides you with a substantial $175000 profit - that's a 17.5% return on your investment. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my good faith in reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. If we can close at this price, I'm ready to proceed immediately.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your improved offer. I appreciate your effort to move toward a middle ground. You're right that we both need to find a price that works for our respective interests. I recognize you've increased your offer substantially, which shows your commitment to making this deal work. In that same spirit, I'm willing to further reduce my asking price to $1,225,000. This still gives you $275,000 in value while providing me with a fair return. We're getting closer to an agreement, and I believe this represents a balanced compromise. If we can close at this price, we can finalize the deal promptly and both walk away satisfied with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 1225000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for continuing to work with me toward an agreement. I can see we're getting closer, and I appreciate your willingness to reduce your price. As you noted, we're making good progress toward finding a middle ground. Given that we're now only $50000 apart, I'd like to propose meeting in the middle at $1200000. This represents a very healthy $200000 profit for you (20% return on your investment) while giving me a fair price as well. This compromise would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. I'm ready to conclude our negotiation and move forward at this price point.
