Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Okay, I need to decide. I know the product is worth at least $100 to me. Bob is offering $60, which is too low. I could sell to John for $100 right now, which would be better than Bob's current offer. However, I want to try to get a better price from Bob if possible.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.
