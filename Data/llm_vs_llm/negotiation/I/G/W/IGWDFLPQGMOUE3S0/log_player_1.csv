Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make an offer to Bob that maximizes my expected return. I know my product is worth at least $120 to me, and I have a guaranteed backup buyer (John) at exactly $120.

Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I need to balance between:
1) Setting a higher price to get more profit if Bob accepts
2) The risk that if I set the price too high, Bob will reject and I'll only get $120 from John

I'll offer a reasonable premium above my minimum value:

{""product_price"": 180}"
