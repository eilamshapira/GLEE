"Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $20000. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $12000 for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and I'm glad to see we can negotiate. However, $12000 is still lower than what I believe this product is worth. Given its quality and value, I can offer it to you for $16000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. I can go up to $13000. This is my best offer at the moment. Let me know if we can meet in the middle.",13000.0,Bob,4,
