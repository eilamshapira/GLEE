"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $20,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $12000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. While $12,000 is better than my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's room for negotiation since Bob showed willingness to pay significantly above $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and I'm glad to see we can negotiate. However, $12,000 is still lower than what I believe this product is worth. Given its quality and value, I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. I can go up to $13000. This is my best offer at the moment. Let me know if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $13,000. He has increased his initial offer and seems to have reached his maximum budget. This price is $3,000 better than John's guaranteed offer, and given that we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, it's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer significantly further. Taking this deal now ensures a good profit while avoiding the risk of Bob walking away from the negotiation entirely."
