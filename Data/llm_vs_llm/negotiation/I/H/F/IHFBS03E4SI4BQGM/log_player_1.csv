"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $6,000 as it's well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 (which is what John is offering). Since Bob's initial offer is so low, it suggests we're quite far apart in our valuations. However, I'll continue negotiating for now since we have several rounds left.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still maintain a strong position since Bob's offer was very low.

{""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's second offer only increased by $1,000 from his first offer, and is still far below John's guaranteed offer of $12,000. Given that we're now in round 4 and Bob's incremental increase is very small, it seems unlikely that we'll reach a price above $12,000 in the remaining rounds. The most rational decision is to take John's guaranteed offer.
