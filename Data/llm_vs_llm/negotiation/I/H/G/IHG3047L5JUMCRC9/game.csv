"Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well. I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth and potential benefits.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product could be valuable,  $1500000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $1000000 as the product is worth at least $1200000 to me. I already have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1200000. However, I'd prefer to work with you, so I can offer it to you for $1300000, which is still a significant reduction from my initial price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm glad to hear you'd prefer to work with me directly.  How about we meet in the middle at $1150000? That's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
