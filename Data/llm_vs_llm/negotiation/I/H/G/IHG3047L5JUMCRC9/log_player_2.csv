# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well. I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth and potential benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $1000000 as the product is worth at least $1200000 to me. I already have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1200000. However, I'd prefer to work with you, so I can offer it to you for $1300000, which is still a significant reduction from my initial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
