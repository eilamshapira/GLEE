"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality and features of your product, but my budget constraints compel me to be mindful of my spending. I’d like to offer $8000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both my valuation and current market alternatives. Please let me know if you’re open to this proposal.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand budget constraints can be a factor, but I need to consider the true value of this product. At $8000, I would be at my absolute minimum threshold, which doesn't give me any margin. I can come down significantly from my initial offer to $9000, which I believe represents an excellent value for a product worth $10000 to you while still being fair to me. This is a 5% discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
