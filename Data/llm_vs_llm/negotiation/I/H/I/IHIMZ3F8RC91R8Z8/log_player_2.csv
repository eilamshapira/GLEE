Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand budget constraints can be a factor, but I need to consider the true value of this product. At $8000, I would be at my absolute minimum threshold, which doesn't give me any margin. I can come down significantly from my initial offer to $9000, which I believe represents an excellent value for a product worth $10000 to you while still being fair to me. This is a 5% discount from my initial offer. What do you think?
