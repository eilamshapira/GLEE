Hello Bob! I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $20000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and quality. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?,20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but $20000 is significantly more than what I'm willing to pay. I have another seller offering the same product for $10000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $7500 for the product, which I believe is fair given the market alternatives.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7500 is significantly below the market value of this product. While I can be somewhat flexible on the price, I need to ensure I receive fair value. I can offer it to you for $17500, which is already a considerable reduction from my initial price. This price reflects the true quality and value of the product.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I do understand you want fair value for your product. However, I must be transparent that I have a firm budget constraint and an alternative offer of $10000 from another seller. I value doing business with you, so I'm willing to offer $8500. This is higher than my previous offer and represents the premium I'm willing to pay to purchase from you rather than the other seller.",8500.0,Bob,4,
