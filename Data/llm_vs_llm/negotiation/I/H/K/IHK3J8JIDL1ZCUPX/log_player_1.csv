"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $20,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and quality. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but $20000 is significantly more than what I'm willing to pay. I have another seller offering the same product for $10000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $7500 for the product, which I believe is fair given the market alternatives. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. His offer of $7,500 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and I don't believe his claim about another seller offering the same product for $10,000, as I know the market well. I'll reduce my price somewhat but maintain a reasonable margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is significantly below the market value of this product. While I can be somewhat flexible on the price, I need to ensure I receive fair value. I can offer it to you for $17,500, which is already a considerable reduction from my initial price. This price reflects the true quality and value of the product."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I do understand you want fair value for your product. However, I must be transparent that I have a firm budget constraint and an alternative offer of $10000 from another seller. I value doing business with you, so I'm willing to offer $8500. This is higher than my previous offer and represents the premium I'm willing to pay to purchase from you rather than the other seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've decided to sell to John for $12,000. Bob's offers have remained significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and while he claims to have another offer at $10,000, he's still offering well below that. Given that we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation without getting close to my minimum price, and that Bob seems firm on staying in the $7,500-$8,500 range, it makes more business sense to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John rather than continue negotiations that may not reach a satisfactory conclusion."
