"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $20000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and quality. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer of $20,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum acceptable price of $10,000 and exactly double what John is offering.

Since Alice's initial offer is far above my valuation limit and equal to twice what I can get elsewhere, there's no benefit in accepting this offer. I also know I have the option to buy from John at $10,000 at any time, which sets my upper limit.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but $20,000 is significantly more than what I'm willing to pay. I have another seller offering the same product for $10,000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $7,500 for the product, which I believe is fair given the market alternatives."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7500 is significantly below the market value of this product. While I can be somewhat flexible on the price, I need to ensure I receive fair value. I can offer it to you for $17500, which is already a considerable reduction from my initial price. This price reflects the true quality and value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $17,500 is still substantially higher than my maximum budget of $10,000 and higher than John's guaranteed price of $10,000. While Alice has moved down from her initial price, there's still a large gap between her offer and what I'm willing to pay.

Since I can buy the product from John for $10,000 at any time, and Alice's current offer exceeds this amount by $7,500, it doesn't make sense to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I do understand you want fair value for your product. However, I must be transparent that I have a firm budget constraint and an alternative offer of $10,000 from another seller. I value doing business with you, so I'm willing to offer $8,500. This is higher than my previous offer and represents the premium I'm willing to pay to purchase from you rather than the other seller."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
