Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to set a price that maximizes my earnings while considering Bob might reject my offer if it's too high. If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed $10,000 from John.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll price it higher than my guaranteed alternative but not so high that rejection becomes extremely likely.
