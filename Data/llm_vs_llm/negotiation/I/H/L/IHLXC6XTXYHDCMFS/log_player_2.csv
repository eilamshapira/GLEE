"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,300,000 exceeds the maximum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me, and John is offering to sell the same product for exactly $800,000, I should buy from John to save money.
