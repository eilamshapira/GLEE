"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I think $115 is a bit high for me. The product looks good, but I'm working with a budget. I'd be comfortable paying $105 for it. This gives you a fair profit while helping me stay within my budget. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway - how about $110?  That gives you a great deal on a valuable product, and it's still a good price for me.",110.0,Alice,3,
