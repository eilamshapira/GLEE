Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I think $115 is a bit high for me. The product looks good, but I'm working with a budget. I'd be comfortable paying $105 for it. This gives you a fair profit while helping me stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
