"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $115.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's offer of $115 is below my maximum valuation of $120, but it's still on the high side. Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, and I have the option to negotiate with Alice further, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. The product is worth $100 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I think $115 is a bit high for me. The product looks good, but I'm working with a budget. I'd be comfortable paying $105 for it. This gives you a fair profit while helping me stay within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway - how about $110?  That gives you a great deal on a valuable product, and it's still a good price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has come down from $115 to $110, which is a good improvement and well below my maximum valuation of $120. This is $10 better than buying from John. While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has already met me halfway from her initial offer. This seems like a reasonable price that gives both of us value - Alice makes $10 profit above her $100 cost, and I save $10 compared to buying from John.
