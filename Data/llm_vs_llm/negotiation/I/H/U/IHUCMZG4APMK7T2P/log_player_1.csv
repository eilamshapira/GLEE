Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $250 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I can get this product from another seller for $120. But I'd like to negotiate with you first. Would you consider selling it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is too low for me to consider. I can't go that low. However, since I'd prefer to sell to you if possible, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about this?"", ""product_price"": 220}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $220 is still significantly higher than market value. I know I can get this product for $120 from another seller, so I can't justify paying that much more. To make it worth both our time, I could offer $100. What do you think?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob is still offering a price far below what I need to make a profit. I have the guaranteed $150 from John. While I'd like to sell to Bob, the gap is too wide.
