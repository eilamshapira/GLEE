"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $1,150,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000, and it's also higher than John's fixed price of $800,000. It would be rational to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Even if negotiations with Alice fail, I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 650000}

I'll start with a relatively low offer of $650,000. This is significantly below both Alice's cost ($1,000,000) and John's alternative price ($800,000), which gives room for negotiation. While I know Alice won't accept this initial offer since it's below her cost, it establishes a low anchor point from which we can work up towards a more reasonable price. My goal is to eventually reach a price below $800,000 (John's price), but I need to start low to have room for negotiation upward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has lowered her price significantly from $1,150,000 to $950,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this price is still above both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's offer ($800,000). It makes sense to reject this offer and continue negotiating. Since Alice has shown flexibility by reducing her price by $200,000, there might be room for further negotiation to reach a price below $800,000. If we can't reach an agreement, I can still take John's offer of $800,000 as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 725000}

I'm increasing my offer from $650,000 to $725,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer (up $75,000), showing that I'm willing to negotiate in good faith. This price is still below John's price of $800,000, which gives me room to potentially negotiate further while still maintaining the possibility of saving money compared to John's offer. While this is still below Alice's cost, it shows substantial movement from my initial position and might encourage Alice to continue negotiating toward a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's best to buy from John for $800,000. Here's why:

1. Alice's latest offer ($875,000) is still above John's price ($800,000)
2. While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate down (from $1,150,000 to $875,000), she's still not offering a better deal than John
3. Given that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, it's unlikely she'll go below her cost, let alone below John's price of $800,000
4. We've already spent 5 rounds negotiating, and the risk of continuing further without getting a better deal than John's $800,000 isn't worth it

Therefore, the rational choice is to take the guaranteed option of buying from John at $800,000, which is both within my maximum value and better than Alice's current offer."
