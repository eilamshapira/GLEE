Hi Bob! I have a great product I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200.,200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $200 is far above what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can actually get the same product from another seller for $80. But I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you consider selling it to me for $60? This would save me the hassle of going to another seller and would still give you a sale today.",60.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate you considering doing business with me. However, I can't go down to $60. The lowest I can go is $180.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you reducing your price, but $180 is still much higher than I can justify. As I mentioned, I can buy this exact product from John for $80, which is the maximum this product is worth to me. If you'd like to make the sale today, I could offer you $70, which would save me a bit compared to John's price while still giving you my business. Otherwise, I'll need to go with John's offer.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you. However, $70 is too low for me to consider. To be honest, the product is worth more than that to me. Considering I value it at a minimum of $120, I can't go below $160.",160.0,Alice,5,
