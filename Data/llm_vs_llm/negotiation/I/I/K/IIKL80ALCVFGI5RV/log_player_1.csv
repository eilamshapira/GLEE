Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I have a great product I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $200 is far above what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can actually get the same product from another seller for $80. But I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you consider selling it to me for $60? This would save me the hassle of going to another seller and would still give you a sale today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $60. I need to get at least $120.

My decision: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate you considering doing business with me. However, I can't go down to $60. The lowest I can go is $180."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you reducing your price, but $180 is still much higher than I can justify. As I mentioned, I can buy this exact product from John for $80, which is the maximum this product is worth to me. If you'd like to make the sale today, I could offer you $70, which would save me a bit compared to John's price while still giving you my business. Otherwise, I'll need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob is really lowballing me. He's clearly trying to get a bargain. $70 is still far below what I need. I also suspect he might be bluffing about John's offer. However, I can't ignore his claim and I would lose money if I sell to him for $70.

My decision: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you. However, $70 is too low for me to consider. To be honest, the product is worth more than that to me. Considering I value it at a minimum of $120, I can't go below $160."", ""product_price"": 160}"
