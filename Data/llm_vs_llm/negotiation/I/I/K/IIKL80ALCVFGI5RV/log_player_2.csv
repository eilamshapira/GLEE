"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a great product I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","$200 is significantly higher than the product is worth to me (no more than $80) and higher than John's fixed price offer. It makes more sense for me to either negotiate with Alice or simply buy from John.

Since John is offering the product at $80, which is exactly the maximum value the product has to me, I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If the negotiations don't go well, I can always buy from John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $200 is far above what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can actually get the same product from another seller for $80. But I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you consider selling it to me for $60? This would save me the hassle of going to another seller and would still give you a sale today."", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate you considering doing business with me. However, I can't go down to $60. The lowest I can go is $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $180 is still significantly higher than the product's value to me (maximum $80) and more than double John's price of $80. Since I can buy the exact same product from John for $80, there's no reason for me to accept Alice's offer of $180.

I'll reject Alice's offer. I could make another counteroffer, but since Alice only came down $20 from her initial $200 price, it seems unlikely we'll reach a price better than John's $80. However, I'll give negotiations one more try before going to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you reducing your price, but $180 is still much higher than I can justify. As I mentioned, I can buy this exact product from John for $80, which is the maximum this product is worth to me. If you'd like to make the sale today, I could offer you $70, which would save me a bit compared to John's price while still giving you my business. Otherwise, I'll need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you. However, $70 is too low for me to consider. To be honest, the product is worth more than that to me. Considering I value it at a minimum of $120, I can't go below $160. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has come down to $160, but that's still double the price of John's offer ($80) and double the maximum value the product has to me ($80). Alice also shared that the product is worth at least $120 to her, which suggests we have a significant gap in our valuations.

Given that:
1. Alice values the product at a minimum of $120
2. I value the product at a maximum of $80
3. John will sell me the product for $80

There doesn't appear to be a zone of possible agreement between Alice and me, since she won't sell below her valuation. Since I can get the product from John at exactly my maximum valuation ($80), that's clearly the best option.
