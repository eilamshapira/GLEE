"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","The offer of $1,200,000 is higher than my maximum willingness to pay of $800,000. Therefore, I should reject the offer. Buying from John is a better option than accepting the offer.
