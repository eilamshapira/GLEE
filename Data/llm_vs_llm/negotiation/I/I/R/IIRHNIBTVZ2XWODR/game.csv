"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $25000.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, $25000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $10000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $10000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's exceptional quality and potential benefits, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer it to you for $22000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $22000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $16000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $20000 as a compromise. This price still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account your budget constraints. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",20000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I could potentially do $17000, but that's really pushing my limit for this purchase.",17000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I can see that we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. Considering your limit is $17000, I'm willing to make a final compromise. I'd like to offer the product to you for $19000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. If this doesn't work for you, I may need to consider other options. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",19000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  To be completely honest, I'm getting close to walking away.  I can do $17500, but if that doesn't work, I'll likely buy from John.",17500.0,Bob,8,
