"Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll find our price of $14500 quite reasonable.",14500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find $14500 to be quite high for my budget. I've done my market research, and I would like to make a counteroffer of $7000 for the product. This is a fair starting point considering market conditions.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
" After careful consideration, we're willing to lower our price to $13000. This reflects a significant reduction from our initial offer and demonstrates our commitment to reaching an agreement with you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, I should be transparent - I have another seller offering this product for $8000. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I can only go up to $7500 for this product. This is a fair increase from my previous offer, and I hope we can find common ground.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"After reevaluating our position, we're willing to offer the product at $11000. This price reflects a significant discount from our initial offer, and we believe it demonstrates our eagerness to work with you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I need to be completely honest - I have a firm offer from another seller for $8000, and that's actually the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. To make it worth choosing you over the other seller, I would need a better price. I can offer $7800, which is very close to my absolute maximum. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll need to go with the other offer.",7800.0,Bob,6,
