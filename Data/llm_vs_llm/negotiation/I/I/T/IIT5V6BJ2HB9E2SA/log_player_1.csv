Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find $14500 to be quite high for my budget. I've done my market research, and I would like to make a counteroffer of $7000 for the product. This is a fair starting point considering market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

# Alice's message: ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, given the product's value, I'm afraid $7,000 is too low for us to consider. We need to find a middle ground that works for both parties. Let's continue the negotiation.""

# New offer: The product price will be $13,000"

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, I should be transparent - I have another seller offering this product for $8000. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I can only go up to $7500 for this product. This is a fair increase from my previous offer, and I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

# Alice's message: ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your transparency. However, $7,500 is still too low for us to accept. We're willing to make another concession, though, to show our good faith in negotiating with you.""

# New offer: The product price will be $11,000."

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I need to be completely honest - I have a firm offer from another seller for $8000, and that's actually the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. To make it worth choosing you over the other seller, I would need a better price. I can offer $7800, which is very close to my absolute maximum. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll need to go with the other offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

# Alice's message: ""Bob, I appreciate your candidness and the time you've invested in this negotiation. However, given your constraints and the current offer you have from another seller, I realize that we won't be able to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I wish you all the best, and I hope we can do business together in the future under different circumstances. I have decided to sell the product to another buyer."""
