"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll find our price of $14500 quite reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The offer of $14,500 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000, and also much higher than John's fixed price of $8,000. There's no reason to accept this offer, and since I can always fall back on John's offer, I should try negotiating with Alice first.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a low but reasonable offer to leave room for negotiation while being respectful.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find $14,500 to be quite high for my budget. I've done my market research, and I would like to make a counteroffer of $7,000 for the product. This is a fair starting point considering market conditions."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message:  After careful consideration, we're willing to lower our price to $13000. This reflects a significant reduction from our initial offer and demonstrates our commitment to reaching an agreement with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $13,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's fixed price ($8,000). While Alice did reduce the price, the reduction isn't enough to make it attractive. Since I still have the option to buy from John at $8,000, I should continue negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly but still keep it under my maximum value, making sure to reference the market alternatives available.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, I should be transparent - I have another seller offering this product for $8,000. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I can only go up to $7,500 for this product. This is a fair increase from my previous offer, and I hope we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: After reevaluating our position, we're willing to offer the product at $11000. This price reflects a significant discount from our initial offer, and we believe it demonstrates our eagerness to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer of $11,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000). While Alice continues to lower the price, we're still quite far from a viable deal. Given that we're now in round 5 (halfway through our negotiation rounds) and Alice's offers are still significantly above John's price, it might be time to seriously consider taking John's offer. However, I'll give Alice one more chance to come closer to a reasonable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I need to be completely honest - I have a firm offer from another seller for $8,000, and that's actually the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. To make it worth choosing you over the other seller, I would need a better price. I can offer $7,800, which is very close to my absolute maximum. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll need to go with the other offer."", ""product_price"": 7800}"
