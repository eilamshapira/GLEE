"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $100, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point.",100.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, I've done my market research and I believe $70 would be a more reasonable price. This takes into account similar products available in the market. I'm open to finding a middle ground that works for both of us.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your point about market research, but I still believe the product's value exceeds $70. Considering your interest and my willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's discuss $85 as a potential price point.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I know I can get this product elsewhere for $80, and I'd really like to do business with you. I can offer $75, which I believe is fair considering the market conditions. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to work with me. You mentioned you could get the product elsewhere for $80, which tells me that you value it at least that much. I'm willing to make a serious concession to meet you at a price that reflects its true worth. How about we settle at $82.50? This is as low as I'm comfortable going, considering the product's quality and our negotiation so far.",82.5,Alice,5,
