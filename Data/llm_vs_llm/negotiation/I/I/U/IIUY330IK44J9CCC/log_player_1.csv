"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $100, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, I've done my market research and I believe $70 would be a more reasonable price. This takes into account similar products available in the market. I'm open to finding a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80, and I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your point about market research, but I still believe the product's value exceeds $70. Considering your interest and my willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's discuss $85 as a potential price point."", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I know I can get this product elsewhere for $80, and I'd really like to do business with you. I can offer $75, which I believe is fair considering the market conditions. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Since Bob mentioned he can get the product elsewhere for $80 and he's willing to do business with me, I believe there's still room to negotiate closer to my desired price or at least meet the $80 threshold that I know is acceptable from another buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to work with me. You mentioned you could get the product elsewhere for $80, which tells me that you value it at least that much. I'm willing to make a serious concession to meet you at a price that reflects its true worth. How about we settle at $82.50? This is as low as I'm comfortable going, considering the product's quality and our negotiation so far."", ""product_price"": 82.50}"
