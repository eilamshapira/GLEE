"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product which I understand would provide significant value to your business. Based on market analysis and the product's unique features, I'm offering it to you at $1450000. This price reflects both the exceptional quality and the substantial return on investment you can expect. I'm confident this represents a fair value given the $1500000 worth you'll receive from it.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is of high quality, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'm prepared to offer $1100000 for the product. This considers both its value and my budget constraints.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and counteroffer. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I must point out that your offer of $1100000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at $1200000, but I'd prefer to work with you. Given the product's value to you at $1500000, I'm willing to reduce my initial price to $1375000, which would still provide you with substantial value while meeting my business requirements. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and would be a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for clarifying. I understand you have other potential buyers, but $1375000 is still too high for me. Considering the information we've both shared, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I propose $1237500. This represents a fair compromise and hopefully allows us to close the deal.",1237500.0,Bob,4,
