Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is of high quality, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'm prepared to offer $1100000 for the product. This considers both its value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and counteroffer. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I must point out that your offer of $1,100,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at $1,200,000, but I'd prefer to work with you. Given the product's value to you at $1,500,000, I'm willing to reduce my initial price to $1,375,000, which would still provide you with substantial value while meeting my business requirements. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and would be a mutually beneficial arrangement."", ""product_price"": 1375000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for clarifying. I understand you have other potential buyers, but $1375000 is still too high for me. Considering the information we've both shared, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I propose $1237500. This represents a fair compromise and hopefully allows us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,237,500.
