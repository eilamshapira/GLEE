Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product which I understand would provide significant value to your business. Based on market analysis and the product's unique features, I'm offering it to you at $1450000. This price reflects both the exceptional quality and the substantial return on investment you can expect. I'm confident this represents a fair value given the $1500000 worth you'll receive from it.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is of high quality, the price point is a bit high for me right now.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and counteroffer. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I must point out that your offer of $1100000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at $1200000, but I'd prefer to work with you. Given the product's value to you at $1500000, I'm willing to reduce my initial price to $1375000, which would still provide you with substantial value while meeting my business requirements. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and would be a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for clarifying. I understand you have other potential buyers, but $1,375,000 is still too high for me. Considering the information we've both shared, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I propose $1,237,500. This represents a fair compromise and hopefully allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1237500}"
