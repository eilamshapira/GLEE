"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a high offer to maximize my potential earnings. Considering the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, I'll start with an even higher price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,000,000, I will not accept Bob's offer.

However, I still want to explore the possibility of getting a better deal from Bob, so I won't sell to John just yet.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $500,000, which is quite low, I'll make a counteroffer that is still high but slightly lower than my initial offer, to show that I'm willing to negotiate.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $800,000 is higher than his previous one, but it's still lower than the minimum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me. Since I have the option to sell it to John for $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer, I will not accept Bob's offer.

However, I'll give Bob another chance to increase his offer, so I won't sell to John just yet.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $800,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous one, to show that I'm willing to continue negotiating.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $900,000 is getting closer to the minimum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me, but it's still lower. Since I have the option to sell it to John for $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer, I will not accept Bob's offer.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $900,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous one, to show that I'm willing to continue negotiating. I'll also take into account that Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, so I won't lower the price too much.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $950,000 is very close to the minimum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me. However, it's still $50,000 lower than what I can get from John.

At this point, I think it's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer to $1,000,000 or more, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with John. So, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.
