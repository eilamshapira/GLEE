Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000}

Rationale: Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay exactly that amount, there's no reason for me to offer Bob a lower price. If Bob accepts, I get $1,500,000, and if he rejects, I still get $1,500,000 from John. While the product is only worth $1,200,000 to Bob, making him unlikely to accept, I have nothing to lose by making this offer since I have John as a backup buyer at the same price."
