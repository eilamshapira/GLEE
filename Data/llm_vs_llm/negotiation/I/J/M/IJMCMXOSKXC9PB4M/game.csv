"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $5000. Would you be willing to consider that?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $5000 is significantly below what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $17000, but it's still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $8000? I think that's a fair compromise.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $8000 is a better offer than your previous one, it's still considerably below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $12000.  This is a significant discount from my initial price, but it's the lowest I can go. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
