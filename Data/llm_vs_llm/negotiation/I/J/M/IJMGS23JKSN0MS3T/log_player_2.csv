"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1800000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. Please let me know your decision as soon as possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me. Alice is offering it for $1,800,000. If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy it from John for $1,000,000. Since $1,000,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay, I should buy from John if Alice's price is higher than that.
