"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","While $10,000 is a good offer that's well above my minimum threshold of $8,000, I believe there might still be room for negotiation since Bob came down from $12,000 to $10,000 relatively quickly. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob was willing to pay $10,000, I'll counter with a price slightly higher but more reasonable than my initial offer.

{""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer of $9,500 is quite good - it's well above my minimum threshold and shows we're getting closer to a fair price. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that prolonged negotiations might lead Bob to walk away. Since we're already in round 4 and the offer represents a good profit margin, I'll accept this offer.
