"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer of $12,000 is below my maximum budget of $15,000, I'm inclined to consider it. However, I also want to try to save as much money as possible. Given that this is the first round and I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, I think it's worth trying to see if I can get a better deal from Alice.

Therefore, my decision is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send Alice a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $12,000, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than that. I'll aim for a price that is reasonable and see how Alice responds.

My counteroffer is: {""product_price"": $9,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice rejected my counteroffer of $9,000 and came back with a new offer of $10,500. This is still below my maximum budget of $15,000, but it's higher than I was hoping to pay.

I'm not ready to give up on negotiating yet, and I think I can try to get a better deal. Since Alice was willing to come down from $12,000 to $10,500, I'm hoping she may be willing to come down further.

My decision is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send Alice a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $10,500, I'll try to meet her halfway between her last offer and my previous counteroffer of $9,000.

My counteroffer is: {""product_price"": $9,750}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice rejected my counteroffer of $9,750 and came back with a new offer of $10,000. This is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $12,000, and it's getting closer to my target price.

At this point, I'm starting to think that $10,000 might be a reasonable price for the product. However, I still have 5 more rounds to negotiate, and I don't want to give up yet.

I'll reject Alice's offer one more time and try to see if I can get her to come down a bit further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $10,000, I'll try to make a small concession to see if I can get her to meet me in the middle. I'll offer a price that's slightly higher than my previous counteroffer of $9,750, but still lower than Alice's last offer.

My counteroffer is: {""product_price"": $9,900}"
