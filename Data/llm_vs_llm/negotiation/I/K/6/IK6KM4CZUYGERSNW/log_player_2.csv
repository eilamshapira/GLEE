"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,200,000 and also higher than John's price. It would be best to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, as there might be room for negotiation with Alice to get a better price than John's $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

I'll propose $800,000 as my counteroffer. This is significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer of $2,000,000 and John's price of $1,200,000. This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to get a better deal than John's price. If Alice rejects this, we can still work our way up to a mutually acceptable price, while keeping John's offer as a backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,800,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000). While Alice has reduced the price by $200,000 from her initial offer, it's still not competitive with John's price. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, as there might still be room to negotiate a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'll increase my offer to $1,000,000. This is a $200,000 increase from my previous offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying below John's price of $1,200,000. This gives Alice room to continue negotiating while potentially allowing me to secure a better deal than John's offer. If Alice rejects this, we still have several rounds to negotiate, and John's offer remains as our backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($1,500,000) is still significantly above John's price ($1,200,000)
2. While Alice has been reducing her price (from $2M to $1.8M to $1.5M), the rate of reduction suggests we might not reach a price below $1.2M
3. We've already gone through half of our available rounds
4. Even if Alice eventually comes down in price, there's no guarantee it will be below John's offer
5. John's price is already at my maximum value threshold ($1,200,000)

It's better to secure the deal with John now rather than risk further negotiations that might not lead to a better outcome."
