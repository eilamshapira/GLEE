Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, and I need to get at least $120, I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $120, there's no reason for me to accept Bob's low offer. I could make a counteroffer, but since Bob's initial offer was so low and I have a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, it's most rational to take the sure deal.
