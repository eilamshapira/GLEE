"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that $180 is a bit high for you. However, $100 is too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. How about I will sell you the product for $160?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. However, $130 is still too low for me. Let's settle on $150. That way, we both walk away from this feeling like we've made a fair deal. ",150.0,Alice,5,
