"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  Could you do $180?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $180 is still too high for me. How about we settle at $85? Let me know if that works for you.",85.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems like we're pretty far apart on price. To be honest, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. I'm willing to let it go to you for $150, but that's my absolute bottom line.",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your situation, but $150 is still beyond what I'm willing to spend. I can go up to $95, which is my final offer. If that doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",95.0,Bob,6,
