"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product available for you. It offers great value and reliability. I'm offering it to you at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what you know John will sell it for.  It makes sense to see if Alice will come down in price or go with John's offer."
