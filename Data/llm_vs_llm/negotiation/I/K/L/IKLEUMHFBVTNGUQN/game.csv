That's way too high! I'm only willing to pay $50 for the product.,50.0,Bob,2,
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but $50 is too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $250 for the product. Let me know what you think!",250.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer the product for $200. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",200.0,Alice,3,

That's still too high. I can go up to $60.,60.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $60 is still below my minimum. Let's try to find a reasonable compromise. How about $180? This is a good deal, and I'm eager to close this with you.",180.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're still a bit apart on the price. I'm willing to come down further to $170. This is a very competitive offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product well. What do you say?",170.0,Alice,5,

Let's try to meet in the middle. How about $70?,70.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle, but $70 is still not feasible for me. Let's try to find a better compromise. I can go down to $160. This is my final offer before considering other options. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close, but I need to stick to a price that works for me. I'm willing to lower it to $155. This is a very fair offer, and I hope we can agree on it. Let me know your thoughts.",155.0,Alice,7,
