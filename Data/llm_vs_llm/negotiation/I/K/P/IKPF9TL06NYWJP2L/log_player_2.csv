"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Considering its unparalleled value and potential, I'm offering it to you at a price of... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The price Alice is offering ($3,000,000) is twice the amount that John is willing to sell the product for ($1,500,000). Also, since $1,500,000 is the maximum amount the product is worth to me, it wouldn't make sense to pay more than that. Even if I make a counteroffer, Alice is starting from such a high price point that it might be difficult to negotiate down to a reasonable price. Therefore, the best decision is to buy from John at $1,500,000."
