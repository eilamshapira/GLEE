"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I've done some research and found similar products at lower prices. I'm willing to pay $6000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to be honest with you - $6000 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product's quality and value justify a higher price point. I'm willing to work with you, though. I can come down to $9200, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still offering you savings compared to similar items on the market.",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9200 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your revised offer. I'd like to propose a price of $7600.",7600.0,Bob,4,
