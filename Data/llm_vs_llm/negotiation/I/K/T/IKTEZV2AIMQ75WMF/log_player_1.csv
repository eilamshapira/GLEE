Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to be honest with you - $6,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product's quality and value justify a higher price point. I'm willing to work with you, though. I can come down to $9,200, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still offering you savings compared to similar items on the market."", ""product_price"": 9200}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9200 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your revised offer. I'd like to propose a price of $7600.
