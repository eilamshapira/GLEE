Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to be honest with you - $6000 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product's quality and value justify a higher price point. I'm willing to work with you, though. I can come down to $9200, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still offering you savings compared to similar items on the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
