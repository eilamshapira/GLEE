"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer of $150 is higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, which is $120, I will reject her offer. I'd like to try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm willing to pay up to $120, I'll offer a price that's somewhat lower to leave room for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $130 is still higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, which is $120. However, it's closer to my target price than her initial offer. I'll reject her offer again and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer of $130 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay, I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my target price of $120, but still a bit higher than my previous offer of $100. This will show that I'm willing to compromise and meet Alice halfway.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $125 is very close to my maximum budget of $120, but it's still slightly above it. At this point, I have to consider that buying from John for $120 is a viable option. Since Alice's offer is only $5 more than my maximum budget, I'll think about whether it's worth paying a bit extra to buy from Alice.

However, since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I think I'll choose to buy from John instead, as it's the best option for my budget.
