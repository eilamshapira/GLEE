"Hello Bob, I'd like to offer you a valuable product that I'm currently planning to sell. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase it for $8000, but I wanted to give you the opportunity first. This product represents significant value, and I'm offering it to you for $10500. This price offers you substantial value while also allowing me to make a reasonable profit on the sale. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",10500.0,Alice,1,
