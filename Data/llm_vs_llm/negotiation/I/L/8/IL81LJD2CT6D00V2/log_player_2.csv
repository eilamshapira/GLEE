"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $150 is higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. If the negotiation doesn't work out, I can always buy from John at $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 80}

I'm offering $80, which is below John's price of $100. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to John's price. If Alice rejects this offer, we can continue negotiating, or I can always fall back to buying from John at $100."
