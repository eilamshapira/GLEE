"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $14,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but I believe we can agree on a lower price. How about $13000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $13,000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and I know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob. There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $13,000 is too low considering the product's value. I can come down from my initial price, but I believe $14,000 is a more reasonable price for this product given its quality and market value."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on $13500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $13,500. This is a reasonable compromise that gives both parties value. It's significantly better than John's offer of $12,000, and while Bob might be willing to go higher, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether. The $13,500 price point gives me a good profit while still giving Bob room to benefit from the product's $15,000 value to him."
