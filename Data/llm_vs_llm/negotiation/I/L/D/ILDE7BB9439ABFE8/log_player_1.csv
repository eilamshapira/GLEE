"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since the product is worth no less than $80 to me, and Bob's offer is exactly $80, I could consider accepting it. However, I still have 8 rounds left to potentially negotiate a higher price. Given that selling to John for $80 is an option that guarantees me at least $80, and Bob's offer is at the minimum of what I'm willing to accept, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $80, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept, my next counteroffer will be slightly higher than my initial offer to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle.

{""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer of $90 is higher than his previous offer and higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($80), but it's still lower than my initial offer ($120) and my last counteroffer ($110). Since Bob is increasing his offer, it shows he's interested in the product and willing to negotiate. I'll reject his offer again to try to get closer to my target price, but I'll also consider making a smaller concession in my next counteroffer to keep the negotiation going.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Given that Bob's last offer was $90, and considering I want to keep the negotiation going while trying to get a better price, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one but still higher than Bob's last offer.
