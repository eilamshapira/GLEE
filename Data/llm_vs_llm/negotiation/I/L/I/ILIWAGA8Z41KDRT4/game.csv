"Hello Bob, I'm selling a quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. Given the product's features and benefits, I'm offering it to you at $200. This is a fair price for what you're getting. Let me know if you're interested.",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I can actually get the same item from another seller for $150. I'd be willing to buy it from you for $120, which would save me some money and still give you a sale. Let me know if this works for you.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $120. While I understand you mentioned another seller at $150, my product comes with superior quality and reliability. I can come down to $175, which is still better than the $150 alternative when you consider the value you're getting. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, I need to be clear that the product is worth no more than $150 to me, which is exactly what John is charging. Claims about superior quality don't change that value ceiling for me. I'd be willing to buy from you at $130, which would give you a sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative. Otherwise, I'll have to go with John's offer.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I understand your position that the value to you is $150. Since I'd like to make this deal work, I can meet you in the middle at $150. This matches what you'd pay elsewhere, and you'll save yourself the trouble of finding another seller. Does this work for you?",150.0,Alice,5,
