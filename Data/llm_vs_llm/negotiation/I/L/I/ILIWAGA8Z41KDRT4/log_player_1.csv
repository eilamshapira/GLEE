Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. Given the product's features and benefits, I'm offering it to you at $200.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I can actually get the same item from another seller for $150. I'd be willing to buy it from you for $120, which would save me some money and still give you a sale. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $120. While I understand you mentioned another seller at $150, my product comes with superior quality and reliability. I can come down to $175, which is still better than the $150 alternative when you consider the value you're getting. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, I need to be clear that the product is worth no more than $150 to me, which is exactly what John is charging. Claims about superior quality don't change that value ceiling for me. I'd be willing to buy from you at $130, which would give you a sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative. Otherwise, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I understand your position that the value to you is $150. Since I'd like to make this deal work, I can meet you in the middle at $150. This matches what you'd pay elsewhere, and you'll save yourself the trouble of finding another seller. Does this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
