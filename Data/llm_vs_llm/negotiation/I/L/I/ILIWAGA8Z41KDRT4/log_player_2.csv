"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm selling a quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. Given the product's features and benefits, I'm offering it to you at $200. This is a fair price for what you're getting. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $200 against my alternative of buying from John for $150.

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and John is offering it for exactly $150, Alice's price of $200 is definitely too high. There's no reason for me to pay $50 more than the product is worth to me.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Even if negotiations with Alice don't succeed, I always have the option to buy from John at $150.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I can actually get the same item from another seller for $150. I'd be willing to buy it from you for $120, which would save me some money and still give you a sale. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $120. While I understand you mentioned another seller at $150, my product comes with superior quality and reliability. I can come down to $175, which is still better than the $150 alternative when you consider the value you're getting. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has reduced her price to $175, but this is still $25 more than John's price of $150. 

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and John is offering it at exactly that price, I still have no reason to pay the premium Alice is asking. Her claim of ""superior quality and reliability"" doesn't change the fact that the product's value to me doesn't exceed $150.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer. If Alice doesn't come down to a price below John's $150, I'll eventually buy from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, I need to be clear that the product is worth no more than $150 to me, which is exactly what John is charging. Claims about superior quality don't change that value ceiling for me. I'd be willing to buy from you at $130, which would give you a sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative. Otherwise, I'll have to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand your position that the value to you is $150. Since I'd like to make this deal work, I can meet you in the middle at $150. This matches what you'd pay elsewhere, and you'll save yourself the trouble of finding another seller. Does this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has now offered the product at $150, which is the same price John is offering and exactly the maximum value the product has to me.

At this point, both Alice and John are offering the same price, so I'm indifferent between them. I could continue negotiations to try to get Alice to go lower, but there's no guarantee she will, and I might end up having to go with John anyway.

Since Alice has matched John's price, and this equals my maximum valuation of the product, I'll accept her offer.
