"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you the unique product at a price of $2000000. Let me know if you’re interested or if you’d like to negotiate further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), it would be unwise to accept this offer. Since John is offering the product at my maximum acceptable price, and any counter-offer to Alice would need to be significantly lower than $2,000,000 to be worthwhile, the most rational decision would be to buy from John.
