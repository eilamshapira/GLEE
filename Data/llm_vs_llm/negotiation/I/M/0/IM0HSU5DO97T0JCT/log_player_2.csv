"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Based on its unique value, I'm offering it to you for $1500000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me
2. Alice's offer ($1,500,000) is significantly higher than my maximum value
3. John's fixed price ($1,200,000) matches my maximum value
4. Alice's initial offer is 25% higher than John's price

I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. While John's price is available as a backup, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first to potentially get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,500,000 is considerably above my budget. Given current market conditions and comparable products, I can offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget considerations, but this product provides exceptional value. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1250000. I believe this price reflects the product's true worth and gives us both a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let's analyze the situation:
1. Alice has reduced her price from $1,500,000 to $1,250,000
2. The new price is still above John's price ($1,200,000)
3. Alice seems willing to negotiate, but her current offer is still higher than what we can get from John
4. We know John's price is equal to our maximum value ($1,200,000)

Since Alice's offer is still above John's price, and John's price is already at our maximum value, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer or continue negotiating. The best decision is to buy from John.
