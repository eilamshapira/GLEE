Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 119}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $90 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($80), but lower than what I initially offered ($119), I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

My counteroffer will be $110.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new offer is: {""product_price"": 110}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $100 is higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80) and closer to what I think the product is worth, I'll consider accepting it. However, I'll also think about the possibility of getting an even better price.

Given that Bob's offer is $100 and he initially valued the product at $120, I believe I can try to get a slightly better price. But I also don't want to risk losing the sale.

My decision is to reject Bob's offer of $100 and make a counteroffer of $105, which is still lower than Bob's initial valuation but higher than his current offer.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new offer is: {""product_price"": 105}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 105}"
