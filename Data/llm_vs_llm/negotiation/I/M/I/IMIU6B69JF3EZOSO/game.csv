"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm prepared to pay $12000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in the product while still being a fair price for both of us. I look forward to your response.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $12000. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product. While I can't accept $12000, I can come down from my initial offer. Given the exceptional quality and value this product will bring to you, I can offer it for $13200. This represents a significant discount from my initial price while still reflecting the true value of the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",13200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really looking forward to owning this product, but I need to stay within my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $12500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to make this purchase. I hope you'll consider it.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $12500. We're getting closer to an agreement. Given that this product is worth $15000 in market value, I've already made significant concessions from my initial offer. I can come down to $12900, which I believe represents an excellent value for you while still being fair to me. This is very close to your offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",12900.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you've already made concessions, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12900 is still a little too high for me.
