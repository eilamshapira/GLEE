Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price in negotiations. This leaves room for potential negotiation downward and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** While I haven't explicitly stated why the price is so high, the phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" and mentioning its ""significant value"" are intended to pique Bob's curiosity and potentially justify the price in his mind.
* **Backup Plan:**  I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so any amount above that is a profit. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still leaving room for a deal that could be acceptable to Bob."
