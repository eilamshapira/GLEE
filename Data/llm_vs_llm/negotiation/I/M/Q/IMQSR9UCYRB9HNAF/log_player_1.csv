Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe your initial price is a bit high. I'm willing to make a serious offer to purchase the product, but I need a more reasonable price. I'd like to propose a price that is closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as his proposed price of $900,000 is lower than I'm willing to accept. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm hoping we can meet at a mutually beneficial price. 

My counteroffer: $2,200,000. This price still reflects the high value of the product, but shows that I'm willing to negotiate and consider Bob's budget."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate the effort to bring the price down, but I still believe it's a bit above my budget.

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as his proposed price of $1,200,000 is still lower than I'm willing to accept, but closer to a reasonable range. Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, I'll try to get closer to that price with Bob.

My counteroffer: $1,400,000. This price shows that I'm willing to continue negotiating and find a mutually beneficial agreement, while also being mindful of the alternative option to sell to John."
