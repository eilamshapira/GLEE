"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to consider my options carefully:

1. Alice is offering the product for $120, which is above my maximum value ($100).
2. I could get the same product from John for $100, which equals my maximum value.
3. I could try to negotiate with Alice for a better price.

Since the product is only worth $100 to me, paying $120 would mean losing $20 in value. Meanwhile, John's price of $100 gives me exactly what the product is worth. I could try negotiating with Alice, but given that the product costs her $120, she may not go below that price.
