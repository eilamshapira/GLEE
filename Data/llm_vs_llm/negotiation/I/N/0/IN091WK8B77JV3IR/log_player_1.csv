Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm really excited to offer you this exclusive product! Given its value, I'm asking for $14,000."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to get a better deal. How about $12000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Given that my minimum acceptable price is $12,000, and Bob is offering exactly that, I'll take it.
