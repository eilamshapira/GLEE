Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make an initial offer to Bob. Since I know the product is worth at least $150 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

{""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $50 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I will reject Bob's very low offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will now make a new counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a more reasonable middle ground.

{""product_price"": 200}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's second offer of $65 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and significantly below the guaranteed offer from John. Since Bob's counteroffer only increased by $15 from his initial offer, it seems he might not be willing to reach a price point that would be acceptable to me. At this point, it's best to take the guaranteed offer from John.
