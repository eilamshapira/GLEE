"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm offering you this product for $125. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to analyze the offers:

The product is worth $120 to me, and:
- Alice is offering to sell it for $125
- John is willing to sell it for $120

Since Alice's price is higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120), it doesn't make sense to accept Alice's offer.
