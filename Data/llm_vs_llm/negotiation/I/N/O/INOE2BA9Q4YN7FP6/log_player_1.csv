Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Given Bob's counteroffer of $120, which is more than my minimum value of $80, I have to consider my options carefully. I still have a good number of rounds left. Selling to Bob now nets me a profit of $40, while selling to John nets me a profit of $0.

I'll **reject** Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob is now offering $130. This is a good offer, resulting in a $50 profit. I still have a reasonable number of rounds left, and I'm already significantly above my minimum value. It's tempting to push for more, but I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. I don't know how Bob values the product.

I'll **accept** Bob's offer.
