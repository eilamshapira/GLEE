"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 and Alice is offering the product at that price, you have no incentive to accept her offer. Rejecting her offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with John."
