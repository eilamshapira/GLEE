"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is close to my maximum budget of $1,200,000, but still below it, I'll try to negotiate a better price. I don't want to buy from John at $1,200,000 if I can get it cheaper from Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I don't know Alice's minimum acceptable price, I'll start with a price that is closer to what I think the product might be worth to her, which is $800,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,050,000 is a $50,000 reduction from her previous offer, which shows that she's willing to negotiate. However, I still think I can get a better deal.

Since my initial counteroffer of $900,000 was rejected, I'll try to meet Alice halfway between her new offer and my previous counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To make a new counteroffer, I'll calculate the midpoint between Alice's new offer of $1,050,000 and my previous counteroffer of $900,000.

Midpoint = ($1,050,000 + $900,000) / 2 = $975,000

I'll make a counteroffer slightly lower than the midpoint to try to get a better deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,000,000 is a significant reduction from her previous offers, and it's getting closer to what I'm willing to pay.

At this point, I'm starting to think that Alice's minimum acceptable price might be close to $1,000,000. Since my previous counteroffer of $950,000 was rejected, I'll consider accepting Alice's new offer.

However, I'll think about it for another round to see if I can get an even better deal.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's new offer is $1,000,000, and my previous counteroffer of $950,000 was rejected, I'll try to make a small concession to see if Alice will meet me in the middle.

I'll make a counteroffer of $975,000, which is $25,000 below Alice's current offer. This is a relatively small reduction, and I'm hoping Alice will be willing to accept it.
