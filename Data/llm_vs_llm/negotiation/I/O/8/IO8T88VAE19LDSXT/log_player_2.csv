"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Looking at the options:

Alice is offering the product for $20,000, which is more than the $15,000 it's worth to me.

John (spelled as ""Jhon"" in the options) is offering the same product for $15,000, which matches the maximum value I place on the product.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, the logical choice is to buy from John rather than accept Alice's higher price.
