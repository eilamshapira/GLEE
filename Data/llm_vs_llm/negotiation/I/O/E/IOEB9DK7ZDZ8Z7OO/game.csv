"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the premium quality of your product, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. The maximum value this product represents to my business is $1500000. In fact, I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me a similar product at this price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product, which I believe is fair considering market conditions.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand budget constraints are important, but I should clarify something - I actually have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase this product for $1500000, which represents the absolute minimum value I can accept. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I cannot go below this threshold. Given the product's quality and market value, I'm willing to meet you part of the way. I can offer it at $1900000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and reflects my sincere interest in working with you.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for lowering your price. I appreciate your position, but I need to be transparent - the product is only worth $1500000 to me, which happens to be the exact price John has offered me as a buyer. There seems to be some confusion - John is not buying from you; he's a competing seller offering me the same product. Since I can purchase this product from John at $1500000, I can't justify paying more than that. However, I'd still prefer to do business with you. My best offer is $1450000, which is very close to what I would pay John. This represents the maximum value I can offer while still making this deal worthwhile for my business.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
