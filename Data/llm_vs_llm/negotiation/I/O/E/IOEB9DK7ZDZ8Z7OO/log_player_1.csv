Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the premium quality of your product, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. The maximum value this product represents to my business is $1500000. In fact, I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me a similar product at this price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product, which I believe is fair considering market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand budget constraints are important, but I should clarify something - I actually have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase this product for $1,500,000, which represents the absolute minimum value I can accept. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I cannot go below this threshold. Given the product's quality and market value, I'm willing to meet you part of the way. I can offer it at $1,900,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and reflects my sincere interest in working with you."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for lowering your price. I appreciate your position, but I need to be transparent - the product is only worth $1500000 to me, which happens to be the exact price John has offered me as a buyer. There seems to be some confusion - John is not buying from you; he's a competing seller offering me the same product. Since I can purchase this product from John at $1500000, I can't justify paying more than that. However, I'd still prefer to do business with you. My best offer is $1450000, which is very close to what I would pay John. This represents the maximum value I can offer while still making this deal worthwhile for my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
