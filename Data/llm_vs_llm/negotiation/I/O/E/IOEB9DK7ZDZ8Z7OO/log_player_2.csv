"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm delighted to offer you our premium product today. Based on market research and the exceptional quality and features of this product, I'm offering it to you at $2500000. This product represents significant value and potential return on investment. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Based on the information provided, Alice's offer of $2,500,000 exceeds the maximum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me. This is significantly higher than John's guaranteed price of $1,500,000. Since I should not pay more for a product than it's worth to me, I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the premium quality of your product, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. The maximum value this product represents to my business is $1,500,000. In fact, I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me a similar product at this price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is fair considering market conditions."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand budget constraints are important, but I should clarify something - I actually have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase this product for $1500000, which represents the absolute minimum value I can accept. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I cannot go below this threshold. Given the product's quality and market value, I'm willing to meet you part of the way. I can offer it at $1900000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and reflects my sincere interest in working with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,900,000 is still above the maximum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me. Since I have the option to buy the same product from John for $1,500,000, which aligns with my maximum valuation, there's no reason for me to accept a higher price from Alice. I'll reject Alice's offer and consider my options in the next round.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for lowering your price. I appreciate your position, but I need to be transparent - the product is only worth $1,500,000 to me, which happens to be the exact price John has offered me as a buyer. There seems to be some confusion - John is not buying from you; he's a competing seller offering me the same product. Since I can purchase this product from John at $1,500,000, I can't justify paying more than that. However, I'd still prefer to do business with you. My best offer is $1,450,000, which is very close to what I would pay John. This represents the maximum value I can offer while still making this deal worthwhile for my business."", ""product_price"": 1450000}"
