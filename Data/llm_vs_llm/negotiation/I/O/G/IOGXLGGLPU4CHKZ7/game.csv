"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1450000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd like to counter with $1250000. Let me know what you think!",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad we can continue the discussion. While $1250000 is a serious offer, I was thinking more along the lines of $1420000, considering the product's value and its potential benefits to you.",1420000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1420000 is still a bit out of my budget range. How about we settle at $1300000? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial constraints.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. After considering your offer of $1300000, I'm willing to make a slight concession and meet you halfway between my previous offer and yours. I'm thinking of $1370000 as a fair price for the product.",1370000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for moving closer to my budget. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1370000 is still a bit high for me. Could we possibly settle at $1325000? I think this would be a great compromise for both of us.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I can see that we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. After considering your offer of $1325000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of $1350000 as a fair price for the product, which is still below my initial offer but takes into account your budget constraints.",1350000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your continued willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your latest offer, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1335000? This is a small step up from my last offer but still within my budget.",1335000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I can see that we're very close to reaching a deal. After considering your offer of $1335000, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm thinking of $1342000 as a fair price for the product, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going. I believe this is a great opportunity for both of us, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1342000.0,Alice,9,
