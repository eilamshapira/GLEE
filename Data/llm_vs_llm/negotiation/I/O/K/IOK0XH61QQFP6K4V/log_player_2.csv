"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $11,500 since it's quite close to John's price of $12,000, and knowing that the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there should be room for negotiation to get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm offering $9,000, which is $1,000 above Alice's cost ($8,000). This gives Alice a reasonable profit margin while being significantly lower than both her initial offer ($11,500) and John's price ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation if Alice counters, while still potentially saving me a substantial amount compared to the alternatives."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $10,000. This is a good deal because:
1. It's $2,000 less than John's price of $12,000
2. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $11,500
3. It provides Alice with a reasonable profit ($2,000 above her cost of $8,000)
4. Further negotiation might risk losing this favorable offer, and Alice could return to a higher price"
