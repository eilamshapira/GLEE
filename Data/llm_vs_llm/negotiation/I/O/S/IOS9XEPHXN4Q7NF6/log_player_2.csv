"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's initial offer of $120 is well above my budget of $80, I see no reason to accept it. Additionally, buying from John for $80 is an option, but I'd like to try negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and within my budget. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a lower offer.

{""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $100 is still above my budget of $80, but it's lower than her initial offer of $120. This suggests that she's willing to negotiate. I'm not ready to accept $100, as it's still too high for me. Buying from John for $80 is still an option, but I'd like to continue negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer decreased from $120 to $100, I'll try to meet her halfway between my previous offer of $60 and her current offer of $100. I'll make a counteroffer of $70, which is still within my budget of $80 and shows that I'm willing to compromise.

{""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $90 is getting closer to my budget of $80, but it's still $10 above what I'm willing to pay. I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a mutually agreeable price, but I'm not ready to accept $90. Buying from John for $80 is still a viable option, and I might consider it if Alice's next offer isn't more reasonable.

For now, I'll reject Alice's offer of $90 and try to make another counteroffer. Since Alice has been decreasing her price, I'll try to meet her in the middle again. My next counteroffer will be $75, which is closer to my target price and shows that I'm still willing to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","As I mentioned earlier, my next counteroffer will be $75, which is closer to my target price and shows that I'm still willing to negotiate.

{""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $85 is very close to my budget of $80, and it's clear that she's trying to meet me halfway. However, I still have the option to buy from John for $80, which is $5 less than Alice's current offer.

At this point, I think it's likely that Alice has made her best offer, and further negotiation might not yield a better price. Given that I can buy the product from John for $80, which is a better deal than Alice's current offer, I think it's time to consider walking away from the negotiation with Alice.
