Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This price represents good value considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I believe the product is valuable, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. $8,200 is too close to my minimum acceptable price, and I know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob. Let's continue negotiating.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, I need to get more value for this product. I can lower my initial price to $8,900. This is still well below the product's true value to you and represents a significant reduction from my first offer."", ""product_price"": 8900}"

I'll accept Bob's offer of $8,500. This is a reasonable compromise as it's notably better than John's fixed offer of $8,000, and while we might be able to negotiate further, there's always the risk of Bob walking away. The $8,500 offer provides a decent profit margin above my minimum price of $8,000."
