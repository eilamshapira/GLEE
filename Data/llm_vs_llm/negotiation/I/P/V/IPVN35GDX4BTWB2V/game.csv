"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but 1400000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is significantly below my valuation, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1200000. This would still be a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, 1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering I have another option to buy the product for 1000000 from John, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 1050000. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and your alternative offer. While $1050000 is closer to my valuation than your previous offer, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1150000, but this is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
