Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for round 1:

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but I think $120 is a bit high. I'm looking to spend no more than $100, so how about I offer you $80 instead?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Okay, considering Bob's counteroffer of $80, and knowing the product is worth $100 to me and I can sell it to John for $100, I have to weigh my options.

Since I have 10 rounds, I can try to negotiate for a better price with Bob. I also know that he is willing to pay up to $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:
