"Hello Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe you might be interested in.  I'm asking $2000000 for it. This is a fair price considering its potential value.  Let me know what you think.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I know the market value for similar products, and I have another seller offering it for $1500000. However, I'm interested in doing business with you. Would you consider $1200000 for the product?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $1200000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I understand your perspective, but this product has unique value that justifies a higher price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1700000?",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1200000 just doesn't reflect the true worth of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but $1700000 is the lowest I can go.  This price still allows you to make a significant profit, and it's fair given the product's unique capabilities.  What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I have a firm offer from another seller for $1500000, which is already at the top of my budget. If you can beat that price, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $1350000? This would be a win-win situation, as you'd make the sale and I'd get the product from my preferred seller.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and the fact you're willing to negotiate.  However, $1350000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident this product will generate significant value for you.  Would you be willing to consider $1550000? This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm feeling  generous, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $1500000? That way, you get the product from me, your preferred seller, and I can close this deal.  Let me know what you think. ",1500000.0,Alice,5,
