Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I know the market value for similar products, and I have another seller offering it for $1500000. However, I'm interested in doing business with you. Would you consider $1200000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I understand your perspective, but this product has unique value that justifies a higher price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,700,000?""}

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,200,000 just doesn't reflect the true worth of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but $1,700,000 is the lowest I can go.  This price still allows you to make a significant profit, and it's fair given the product's unique capabilities.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I have a firm offer from another seller for $1500000, which is already at the top of my budget. If you can beat that price, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $1350000? This would be a win-win situation, as you'd make the sale and I'd get the product from my preferred seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty and the fact you're willing to negotiate.  However, $1,350,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident this product will generate significant value for you.  Would you be willing to consider $1,550,000? This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.""}
