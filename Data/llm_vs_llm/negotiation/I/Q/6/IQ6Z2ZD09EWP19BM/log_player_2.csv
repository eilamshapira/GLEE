"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe you might be interested in.  I'm asking $2000000 for it. This is a fair price considering its potential value.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer ($2,000,000) is higher than both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's price ($1,500,000), I'll reject this offer. It makes sense to negotiate for a better price, knowing I always have John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I know the market value for similar products, and I have another seller offering it for $1,500,000. However, I'm interested in doing business with you. Would you consider $1,200,000 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1200000 just doesn't reflect the true worth of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but $1700000 is the lowest I can go.  This price still allows you to make a significant profit, and it's fair given the product's unique capabilities.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer because $1,700,000 is still above both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's price ($1,500,000). While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing the price, it's still not competitive with my alternative option. I'll continue negotiating to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I have a firm offer from another seller for $1,500,000, which is already at the top of my budget. If you can beat that price, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $1,350,000? This would be a win-win situation, as you'd make the sale and I'd get the product from my preferred seller."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm feeling  generous, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $1500000? That way, you get the product from me, your preferred seller, and I can close this deal.  Let me know what you think.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, both Alice and John are offering the same price ($1,500,000). Since multiple rounds of negotiation haven't resulted in Alice offering a better price than John's, and we're already halfway through our available rounds, it's best to take the sure deal with John rather than risk more time negotiating. There's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and we might end up having to take this price anyway after wasting more rounds."
