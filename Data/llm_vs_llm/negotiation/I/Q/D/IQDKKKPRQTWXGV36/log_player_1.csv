Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product but $150 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to do $120?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
