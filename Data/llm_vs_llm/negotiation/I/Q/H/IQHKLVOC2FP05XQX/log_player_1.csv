Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to him and $1,000,000 to me, I'll start with a high price to leave room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

{""product_price"": 1,150,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Bob's offer ($1,075,000) is better than John's fixed offer ($1,000,000)
2. However, since Bob indicated willingness to negotiate and the product is worth $1,200,000 to him, I believe there's room to get a better price
3. The risk of continuing negotiation is low since I always have John's offer as a backup

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob offered $1,075,000, I'll come down from my initial offer but still try to secure a good profit. I'll propose a price that's closer to the middle ground between his offer and my initial offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,095,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,095,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze Bob's new offer:
1. He increased his offer by $20,000 (from $1,075,000 to $1,095,000)
2. This shows he's willing to negotiate upward
3. The offer is significantly better than John's $1,000,000
4. However, since he moved up, there might still be room for one more round of negotiation

I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer, as the trend is moving in a favorable direction.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Given that Bob has moved up to $1,095,000, I'll make one more attempt at a slightly higher price, but I'll reduce the gap significantly to show I'm willing to reach a reasonable conclusion.
