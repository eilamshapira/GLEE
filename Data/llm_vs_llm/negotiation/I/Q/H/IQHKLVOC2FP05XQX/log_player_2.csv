"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is less than my maximum budget of $1,200,000, I am willing to consider it. However, I also believe that Alice's minimum price of $1,000,000 leaves room for negotiation. Therefore, I will reject Alice's initial offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of getting a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable considering her minimum price. Since Alice's minimum price is $1,000,000, I'll aim for a midpoint between that and her initial offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,115,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,115,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,115,000 is a step in the right direction, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since she rejected my previous counteroffer of $1,075,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between that and her new offer.

I'll reject Alice's current offer and make another counteroffer.

(I'll wait for the next step to send the actual counteroffer)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To meet Alice halfway between her new offer of $1,115,000 and my previous counteroffer of $1,075,000, I'll calculate the midpoint: ($1,115,000 + $1,075,000) / 2 = $1,095,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,105,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,105,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,105,000 is getting closer to what I'm willing to pay. Considering she's already come down from $1,150,000 to $1,105,000, I think she might be willing to go a bit lower, but not much.

At this point, I'm starting to feel that the potential savings from further negotiation might not be worth the time and effort. Alice's offer is only $95,000 away from my maximum budget of $1,200,000, and I've already invested time in negotiating.

Given the relatively small difference, I think it's time to accept Alice's offer and finalize the purchase.
