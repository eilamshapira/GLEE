Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm willing to pay up to $8,000, I'll start by offering a price that is significantly lower than that.

I'll reject her offer again and make a new counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $10,000 is still higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($8,000), but it's getting closer. I'll reject her offer again and try to make a more aggressive counteroffer to see if I can get her to meet me at my target price.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer by $1,000 again, to $7,000. This is getting closer to my maximum budget of $8,000, and I'm hoping Alice will be willing to meet me at this price or at least make a more significant concession.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $8,500 is still higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($8,000). However, I notice that John is offering the same product for $8,000, which is within my budget.

At this point, it doesn't seem like Alice is willing to meet me at my target price, and I have a better option available. I'll choose to buy the product from John instead of continuing to negotiate with Alice.
