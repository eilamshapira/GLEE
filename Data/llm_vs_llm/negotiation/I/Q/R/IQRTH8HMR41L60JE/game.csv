"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer that I believe is more reasonable.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but I'm afraid $5000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000, which I believe is a fair price for the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your new offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make another counteroffer that's closer to my budget. I'm thinking of a price that's slightly higher than my previous offer, but still reasonable.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your new offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price. However, $7500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12000, which I believe is a fair price for the product. I'm trying to be flexible and meet you halfway, but I also need to ensure I get a reasonable price for the product.",12000.0,Alice,5,
