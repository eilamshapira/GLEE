"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer that I believe is more reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $5,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually agreeable price. My next offer will be $15,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your new offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make another counteroffer that's closer to my budget. I'm thinking of a price that's slightly higher than my previous offer, but still reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as $7,500 is still below my target price. I'm willing to continue negotiating to find a mutually agreeable price. Since Bob's offer is increasing, I'm hopeful that we can reach a deal. My next offer will be $12,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest counteroffer.
