"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price, but $7000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, I could consider letting it go for $13000.  This is a more reasonable offer, considering its worth.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, I still think $13000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. How about we settle on $10000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
