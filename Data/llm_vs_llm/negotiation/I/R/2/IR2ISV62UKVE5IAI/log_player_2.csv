"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that Alice is offering the product for $150, which is more than the $100 value it has to you, and John is willing to sell the same product for $100, it makes more sense to buy from John.
