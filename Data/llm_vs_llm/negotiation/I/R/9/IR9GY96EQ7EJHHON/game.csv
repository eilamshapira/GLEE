"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 seems a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $70 for the product. Let me know what you think.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit high, but $70 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. Let's try to find a middle ground.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, I'm still finding it hard to justify anything over $90.  Would you be open to that?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I'm getting closer to what I'm looking for, but I still need to get a bit more for the product. How about we meet in the middle of $90 and $120? I think that's a fair price.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to budge a little more. How about $95 and we call it a deal?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. I appreciate your willingness to pay $95, but I'm still a bit short of what I need. Would you be willing to pay $98? That's as low as I can go.",98.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting down to the wire.  I'm willing to split the difference - $96.50 and we have a deal.  What do you say?",96.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference. I'm getting close to what I need, but I still need to get a bit more. I'll meet you at $99, and that's my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I have another buyer interested in the product, and I'll have to consider their offer.",99.0,Alice,9,
