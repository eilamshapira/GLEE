"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 seems a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $70 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $70 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob or sell it to John for $100 if the negotiation doesn't go well."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit high, but $70 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 120}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I'm getting closer to what I'm looking for, but I still need to get a bit more for the product. How about we meet in the middle of $90 and $120? I think that's a fair price."", ""product_price"": 105}"

Round 6

I'll make another counteroffer. Since Bob is willing to pay $95, I think he's very close to my target price, and I might be able to get him to pay just a bit more. I'll try to nudge him up a bit more.
