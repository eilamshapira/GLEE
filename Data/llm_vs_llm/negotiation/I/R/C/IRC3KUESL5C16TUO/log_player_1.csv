Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While the product sounds interesting, $200 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. Based on my research and budget, I can offer you $50 for it. This is a fair price considering similar products on the market. Let me know if this works for you.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $150 is still more than I can spend on this product. I know I can get a similar product elsewhere for $80, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer you $65, which would save me some money while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for continuing to work with me on the price. I appreciate your willingness to reduce it to $125, but I need to be transparent - I can purchase this exact product from another seller for $80. However, I'd still prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair agreement. My best offer is $75, which would save me a little while giving you the sale. Can we make this work?
