"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know if you'd like to take it at this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer of $200 is well above my maximum of $80, so I shouldn't accept it. Since John is offering the product for $80 (which is my maximum acceptable price), I could buy from him immediately. However, I might be able to get a better deal from Alice through negotiation, so I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While the product sounds interesting, $200 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. Based on my research and budget, I can offer you $50 for it. This is a fair price considering similar products on the market. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I believe the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $150. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I hope it aligns better with your expectations. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has come down significantly from $200 to $150, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $150 is still above my maximum value of $80, and John is offering it for $80. I should continue negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a better price than John's $80.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $150 is still more than I can spend on this product. I know I can get a similar product elsewhere for $80, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer you $65, which would save me some money while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 65}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. Given your last offer and my need to maintain a certain value for the product, I'm willing to go down to $125. This is very close to my bottom line, and I hope it's something you can consider. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has reduced her price again to $125, which shows she's continuing to negotiate, but this is still above both my maximum value ($80) and John's offer ($80). Since I can get the product from John for $80, and Alice is still significantly above that price, I should continue negotiating to see if she'll go lower.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for continuing to work with me on the price. I appreciate your willingness to reduce it to $125, but I need to be transparent - I can purchase this exact product from another seller for $80. However, I'd still prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair agreement. My best offer is $75, which would save me a little while giving you the sale. Can we make this work?"", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your situation, but I need to stick to my minimum price. I'm offering the product for $120, which is the lowest I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I hope you can agree to it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has only come down to $120, which is still significantly higher than John's offer of $80. Since she's calling this her ""minimum price"" and the ""lowest I can go,"" it seems unlikely she'll go below $80. Given that I can get the product from John for $80 (which is my maximum value for it anyway), I should take that option now.
