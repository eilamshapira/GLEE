"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since the product is worth $10,000 to me and Alice's offer of $9,500 is lower than that, it's a good deal. However, I want to try to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is $1,500 more than what the product is worth to her, so there might be some room for negotiation.

I'll choose option (2) and reject Alice's offer to see if I can get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since Alice's offer was $9,500 and the product is worth $8,000 to her, I'll try to split the difference.

My counteroffer will be $8,500.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has lowered her price to $9,000, which is a better offer than before. However, I still want to try to get the best possible deal.

Since Alice rejected my previous counteroffer of $8,500, I know that she's not willing to go that low. But she did lower her price by $500, which suggests that she's willing to negotiate.

I'll choose option (2) and reject Alice's offer again, and make a new counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one.

(I'll wait for the next round to make my counteroffer)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a new counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one of $8,500. Considering Alice's latest offer of $9,000, I'll try to meet her halfway.

My counteroffer will be $8,750.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has lowered her price again to $8,900, which is getting closer to my target price. Since she's already lowered her price by $600 from her initial offer, I think she's trying to make a deal.

Considering that the product is worth $10,000 to me and Alice's latest offer is $8,900, I'm getting a good deal. I'll choose option (1) and accept Alice's offer, as it's close enough to my target price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by making another counteroffer.
