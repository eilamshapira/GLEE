Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $19,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 19000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting high, I'm aiming to ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he doesn't accept this initial price, it might make him more receptive to a lower, but still profitable, price. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I'm aiming high, I'm conscious of John's standing offer of $12,000. I need to make sure my negotiations with Bob leave me in a position to accept John's offer if needed."
