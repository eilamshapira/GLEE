"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given the information provided, let me analyze my options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: Buy the product for $200
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John for $80

Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and John is offering it at exactly $80, Alice's offer of $200 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation and my alternative option.

The rational choice is to buy from John, as this satisfies my need for the product while spending exactly my maximum valuation.
