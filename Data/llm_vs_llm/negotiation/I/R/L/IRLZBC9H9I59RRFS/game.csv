"Alice, $2000000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. Let me know if that's a number we can work with.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob! While I understand your budget constraints, I cannot go as low as $1000000. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell the product for $1750000. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1750000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your flexibility, but I still can't accept $1250000. How about we settle at $1600000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! While $1400000 is closer to acceptable, I still can't go that low. How about I offer you the product for $1550000? I believe this is a fair compromise. Looking forward to your response!",1550000.0,Alice,7,
