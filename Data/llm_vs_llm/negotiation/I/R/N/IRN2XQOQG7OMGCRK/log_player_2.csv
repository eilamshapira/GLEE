"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth a premium price, and I'm willing to let it go for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Okay, I need to make a decision.

*   **My Value:** The product is worth $80 to me.
*   **Alice's Offer:** $140.
*   **John's Offer:** $80.

The offer from Alice is way above what I am willing to pay, and is even more than the value to me. I can buy the product from John for $80. Therefore, I should buy from John.
