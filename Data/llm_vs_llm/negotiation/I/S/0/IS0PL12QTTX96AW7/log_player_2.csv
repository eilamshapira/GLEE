"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth a premium price due to its high quality and demand. I'm willing to let it go for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me think about this:
1. Alice's offer is $180, which is significantly higher than my maximum value ($100)
2. John is offering the product for $100, which matches my maximum value
3. I could try negotiating with Alice, but her initial offer is very high ($180), suggesting she might not come down enough to beat John's price

Since Alice's opening offer is $80 above my maximum value, and John's price exactly matches my maximum willingness to pay, it makes sense to just buy from John rather than engage in potentially lengthy negotiations.
