"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it for $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","The offer from Alice is $18,000, which is considerably higher than the maximum $12,000 that the product is worth to me. John is offering the product for exactly $12,000, which is the maximum I'd be willing to pay.

While I could make a counteroffer to Alice, there's no guarantee she would accept a price below $12,000, and the negotiation might continue for multiple rounds.

Given that John's fixed price matches my maximum valuation, the most rational decision is to go with that option.
