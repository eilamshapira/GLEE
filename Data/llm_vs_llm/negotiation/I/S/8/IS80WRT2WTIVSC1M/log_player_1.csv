Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my premium product to you for $18,000. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend on this product. Based on my market research and budget, I can offer $6000 for the product. This is a fair price considering current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Message: ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. However, $6,000 is much lower than the minimum amount I am comfortable with. I understand that we all have budgets, but I am willing to meet you in the middle to complete the transaction. I am willing to go as low as $15,000."""

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, after considering your offer, I'm willing to lower my price. I can offer you the product for $15,000.
