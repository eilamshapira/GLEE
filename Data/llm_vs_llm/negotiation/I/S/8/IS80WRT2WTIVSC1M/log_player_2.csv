"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my premium product to you for $18000. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that my maximum value for the product is $8,000, Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. It's more than double my maximum value. While I could try to negotiate with Alice, her initial offer being so high suggests she might have a very different value perception. Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value of $8,000, it might be worth making at least one counteroffer to Alice to try getting a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18,000 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend on this product. Based on my market research and budget, I can offer $6,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering current market conditions."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after considering your offer, I'm willing to lower my price. I can offer you the product for $15000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll be getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $15,000 is still significantly above my maximum value of $8,000. While she did reduce the price by $3,000, we're still very far apart in our valuations. Given that she only came down marginally from her initial offer despite my much lower counteroffer, it seems unlikely we'll reach an agreement within my price range. At this point, it would be most rational to take John's offer at $8,000, which is exactly at my maximum value.
