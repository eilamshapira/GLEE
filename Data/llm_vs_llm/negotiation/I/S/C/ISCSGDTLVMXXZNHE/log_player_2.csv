"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product that I believe will bring great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is below my maximum budget of $1,500,000, I'm interested in exploring the possibility of getting a better deal. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer, hoping to negotiate a lower price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, in an attempt to gauge her flexibility and willingness to negotiate.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $500,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 500000}"
