"Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Looking at the options here:

1. Alice is offering the product for $25,000
2. I can reject Alice's offer
3. I can buy the product from John for $10,000

Since the product is only worth up to $10,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $10,000, Alice's offer of $25,000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay.

The most economical choice is clear:
