Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000}

Rationale: Since I know that:
1. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob
2. I can sell it to John for $1,500,000
3. The product is worth no less than $1,500,000 to me

It makes sense to offer the product to Bob at $1,500,000. If Bob accepts, I get my minimum acceptable value. If Bob rejects (which is likely since this price is above his valuation), I can sell to John for the same amount. There's no incentive for me to offer a lower price since I'm guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
