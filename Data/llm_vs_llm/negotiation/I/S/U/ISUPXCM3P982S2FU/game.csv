"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand that the product is unique and valuable, but I was thinking more along the lines of $500000. I believe this price reflects a fair value for the product, considering its potential and rarity.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $500000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I understand your perspective, I must emphasize the unique nature and future potential of this asset. Let's try to meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1650000. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand the value of the product, but I still have to consider my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $900000. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can work something out.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I recognize you're serious, and I appreciate you coming up to $900000. However, I can't go that low. My absolute rock-bottom price, considering the inherent value and potential returns, is $1500000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair one. Think about the bigger picture here.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
