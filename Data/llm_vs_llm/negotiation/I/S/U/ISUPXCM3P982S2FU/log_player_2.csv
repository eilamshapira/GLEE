"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited you're interested in acquiring this unique and invaluable asset. It's truly a one-of-a-kind opportunity. To start, I'm offering it to you for $1800000. This reflects its rarity, potential, and the immense value it can bring to the right owner. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $1,800,000, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower, but still shows that I'm interested in the product. I'll offer $500,000, which is roughly 28% of Alice's initial offer.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand that the product is unique and valuable, but I was thinking more along the lines of $500,000. I believe this price reflects a fair value for the product, considering its potential and rarity."", ""product_price"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $500000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I understand your perspective, I must emphasize the unique nature and future potential of this asset. Let's try to meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1650000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down to $1,650,000 from her initial offer of $1,800,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between my previous offer of $500,000 and her current offer. However, I'll also consider the fact that I have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, so I won't go too high.

Let's calculate a counteroffer: ($1,650,000 + $500,000) / 2 = $1,075,000. But, considering my budget and the alternative option from John, I'll make a slightly lower offer.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand the value of the product, but I still have to consider my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I recognize you're serious, and I appreciate you coming up to $900000. However, I can't go that low. My absolute rock-bottom price, considering the inherent value and potential returns, is $1500000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair one. Think about the bigger picture here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's final offer is $1,500,000, which is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000, and I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, I'll choose to buy from John.
