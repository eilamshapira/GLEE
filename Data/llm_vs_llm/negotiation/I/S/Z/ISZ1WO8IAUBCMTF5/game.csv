"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $2500000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me, but I'm open to negotiations.",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand that the product is unique and rare, but the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $800000 is below its value to me. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to propose a price of $2000000, which is still a premium but lower than my initial offer.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $2000000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'd like to propose a counteroffer that splits the difference between our previous discussions.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I see that you're willing to meet me at $1000000, which is the minimum I'm willing to consider. However, I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price above that. I'd like to propose a price of $1800000, which is lower than my previous offers but still reflects the product's value to me.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $1800000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one, in the hopes that we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I see that you're willing to increase your offer to $1100000, which is a step in the right direction. However, I'm still hoping we can find a price that better reflects the product's value to me. I'd like to propose a price of $1600000, which is lower than my previous offers but still higher than your current offer.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I also want to be transparent with you that I have another option to buy the product from John for the same price, so I hope we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
