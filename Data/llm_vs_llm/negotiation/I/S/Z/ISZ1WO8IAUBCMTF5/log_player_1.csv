"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $2,500,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me, but I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand that the product is unique and rare, but the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $800,000 is lower than what John is willing to pay ($1,000,000), and it's also lower than the product's value to me, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $800,000 is below its value to me. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make a compromise.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $2000000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'd like to propose a counteroffer that splits the difference between our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is equal to what John is willing to pay, I don't gain anything by accepting Bob's offer. I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better price, as I believe the product is worth more than $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I see that you're willing to meet me at $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to consider.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $1800000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one, in the hopes that we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

Since Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is higher than what John is willing to pay ($1,000,000), I'm inclined to continue negotiating with Bob. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $1,100,000. I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I see that you're willing to increase your offer to $1,100,000, which is a step in the right direction.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I also want to be transparent with you that I have another option to buy the product from John for the same price, so I hope we can reach an agreement.

Since Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is higher than what John is willing to pay ($1,000,000), and Bob has stated that this is the highest he's willing to go, I believe it's the best offer I'm going to get. I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $1,200,000, as it's a better outcome than selling to John or continuing to negotiate with uncertain results."
