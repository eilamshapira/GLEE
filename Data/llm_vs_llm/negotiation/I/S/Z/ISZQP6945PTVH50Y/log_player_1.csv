"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a high offer to maximize my potential earnings. Considering the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, I'll start with an even higher price.

{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the minimum value the product is worth to me, I don't want to accept it immediately without trying to negotiate a better price. However, I also don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by rejecting it and potentially not getting a better offer in subsequent rounds.

Given that selling to John would also result in a $1,000,000 sale, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and considering I have 8 more rounds to negotiate, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try and get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $1,000,000, which is the minimum value I'm willing to accept, my counteroffer should be higher but still reasonable to keep the negotiation going. I'll aim for a price that's significantly higher than $1,000,000 but not so high that it would immediately end the negotiation.

Considering my initial offer was $2,000,000, and Bob's counteroffer was $1,000,000, a reasonable next step could be to split the difference or slightly adjust from my initial offer to show willingness to negotiate.

{""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $1,250,000 is an increase from his previous offer of $1,000,000, showing that he is willing to negotiate and pay more for the product. This offer is still below my initial counteroffer of $1,750,000 and my initial offer of $2,000,000, but it's getting closer to a range that might be acceptable.

Given that I have 6 more rounds to negotiate and Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, I believe there's potential to get a better price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is still an option, but since Bob's offer is now higher than that, it makes more sense to continue negotiating with him.

I'll reject Bob's current offer and make a new counteroffer that's lower than my previous one but still higher than Bob's current offer, to continue the negotiation process.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Next, I will send a new counteroffer to Bob.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since I've already decided to make a counteroffer, I'll send it to Bob. As previously determined, my counteroffer is:
