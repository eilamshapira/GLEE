Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $1,500,000
3. Bob's valuation is unknown, but if it's higher than $1,500,000, I should try to capture some of that additional value
4. Setting the price too high risks losing a potentially better deal with Bob
5. However, I have no downside risk due to John's guaranteed offer

Given these factors, I'll set a price significantly above my minimum but not so high as to be unreasonable:

{""product_price"": 2200000}"
