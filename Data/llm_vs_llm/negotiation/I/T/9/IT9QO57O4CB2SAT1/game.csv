"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $175. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $175 is quite high for me. I know similar products are available for much less. I would be willing to pay $85 for the product. This would still give you a reasonable profit.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $85 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $125, which still leaves some room for negotiation. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I know I can get this product elsewhere for $100. To make it worth both our time, I can offer $90. This would still give you a profit while being a fair price for me.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $90 is still significantly below what I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to sell for $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,
