Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $175 is quite high for me. I know similar products are available for much less. I would be willing to pay $85 for the product. This would still give you a reasonable profit.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
