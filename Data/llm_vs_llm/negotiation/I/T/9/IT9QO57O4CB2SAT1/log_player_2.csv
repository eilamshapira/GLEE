"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $175. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer of $175 is significantly higher than both my maximum budget ($100) and John's price ($100), it wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. I also know I can always buy from John for $100, so there's no risk in negotiating with Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but leaves room for negotiation, considering that the product is worth $150 to Alice.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $175 is quite high for me. I know similar products are available for much less. I would be willing to pay $85 for the product. This would still give you a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $85 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $125, which still leaves some room for negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","While Alice has significantly reduced her price from $175 to $125, it's still above both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). Since I can get the product from John for $100, there's no reason to accept $125.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly but remind Alice about the market alternative to encourage a more competitive price.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I know I can get this product elsewhere for $100. To make it worth both our time, I can offer $90. This would still give you a profit while being a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $90 is still significantly below what I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to sell for $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer of $110 is still higher than John's price of $100, and I know I can definitely get it for $100, there's no reason to accept this offer. However, we're getting closer to a reasonable price.
