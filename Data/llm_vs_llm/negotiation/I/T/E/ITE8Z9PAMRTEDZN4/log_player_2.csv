"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $11000, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above your budget and what you know you can get it for from John. By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price or sticking with your backup plan of buying from John for $12,000."
