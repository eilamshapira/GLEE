Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I'm looking to purchase it for a lower price. How about $850000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer since $850,000 is too low considering the product's value to Bob ($1,000,000). We have room for negotiation above the $850,000 mark, and it's also above my minimum threshold of $800,000. I can still try to secure a better price before considering John's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $850,000 is significantly below the product's market value. I can reduce my initial asking price to $920,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value and potential return on investment for you."", ""product_price"": 920000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still looking to purchase the product for a more affordable price. Would you consider selling it for $875000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll continue negotiating as Bob has shown willingness to increase his offer. The current offer of $875,000 is moving in the right direction, but since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, there's still room for a better deal that would benefit both parties. The offer is well above John's $800,000, so I still have leverage to negotiate further."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate you moving up in your offer. You've shown good faith in the negotiations, and I'd like to continue working towards a mutually beneficial agreement. Given the product's significant value and potential returns for your business, I can offer it at $900,000. This represents a substantial discount from my initial asking price while still reflecting the product's true worth."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your patience in this negotiation, Alice. I value the product and understand its worth, but I'm still hoping to reach a lower price. Would you be willing to consider $860000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $860,000. While I could continue negotiating, Bob's movements in price have been getting smaller, and he seems to have reached his resistance point. The offer is significantly better than John's $800,000, and continuing negotiations might risk Bob walking away or becoming frustrated. A $860,000 sale represents a good compromise and ensures a profitable transaction."
