Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you an amazing product that I think you'll really love. How about we start the negotiation at $90?,90.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While $90 is less than what John is offering, I think we can find a price that works better for both of us. The product is worth $80 to you, and I'd like to get a better deal than just $10 off the alternative. How about we meet closer to the middle at $85?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your thoughtfulness. How about we settle on $88 for the product? I think it's a fair compromise.",88.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $88. That's a good step in the right direction. Since we both know the product is worth $80 to you, I'd like to propose $83 as a fair price that gives us both a good deal. That would save me $17 compared to John's price while giving you a $3 profit over your cost. What do you think?",83.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob! It's a good starting point. However, I would like to offer the product at $86. I believe that strikes a better balance for both of us. What do you say?",86.0,Alice,5,
