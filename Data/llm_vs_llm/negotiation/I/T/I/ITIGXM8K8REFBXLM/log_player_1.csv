"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While $90 is less than what John is offering, I think we can find a price that works better for both of us. The product is worth $80 to you, and I'd like to get a better deal than just $10 off the alternative. How about we meet closer to the middle at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $88. That's a good step in the right direction. Since we both know the product is worth $80 to you, I'd like to propose $83 as a fair price that gives us both a good deal. That would save me $17 compared to John's price while giving you a $3 profit over your cost. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $83. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $83
