"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you an amazing product that I think you'll really love. How about we start the negotiation at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice is offering the product for $90, which is less than the $100 it's worth to me. However, I can try to negotiate for an even better price since the product is only worth $80 to Alice, giving us room to negotiate.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While $90 is less than what John is offering, I think we can find a price that works better for both of us. The product is worth $80 to you, and I'd like to get a better deal than just $10 off the alternative. How about we meet closer to the middle at $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your thoughtfulness. How about we settle on $88 for the product? I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has come down from $90 to $88, which shows she's willing to negotiate. Since the product is worth $80 to her and up to $100 to me, there's still room for a better deal. I'll try one more counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $88. That's a good step in the right direction. Since we both know the product is worth $80 to you, I'd like to propose $83 as a fair price that gives us both a good deal. That would save me $17 compared to John's price while giving you a $3 profit over your cost. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 83}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob! It's a good starting point. However, I would like to offer the product at $86. I believe that strikes a better balance for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $86
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has now come down to $86, which is $14 less than John's price of $100. She's moved from $90 to $88 to $86, showing she's willing to negotiate but also suggesting she might not go much lower. Since we're on round 5 of 10, and Alice is giving me a reasonable deal ($6 above her cost), I'll accept this offer rather than risk further negotiation that might not yield much better results.
