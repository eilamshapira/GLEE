"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $130. I know you'll find it very valuable! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of $130, reject it, or buy from John for $150.

Since I'm looking for a product worth no more than $150 to me, and Alice is offering it for $130, which is $20 less than John's price, it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer. This will save me money while still getting the product I want.
