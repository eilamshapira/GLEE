Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a good price to offer Bob for my product. 

Since the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at exactly that price, I don't want to sell for less than $1,000,000.

However, if Bob values the product higher than $1,000,000, I should try to capture some of that additional value. Setting too high a price risks Bob rejecting my offer, but I have nothing to lose by asking for more than my reservation price of $1,000,000.

I'll set a price that's reasonably higher than my guaranteed alternative:

{""product_price"": 1,500,000}"
