"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this carefully.

The product is worth at most $150 to me, and Alice is offering to sell it to me for exactly $150. John is also offering the same product for $150.

If I accept Alice's offer, I'll pay $150.
If I reject Alice's offer, I can still buy from John for $150.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and both options cost the same amount, I could go with either Alice or John. There's no monetary advantage to either choice. However, since I've already been in discussion with Alice, I'll accept her offer.
