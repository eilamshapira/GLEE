"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at a price of $150. This is a quality product and I'm confident it will serve your needs well. Would you like to purchase it at this price?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can get a similar product elsewhere for $80. However, I'm interested in doing business with you. Would you consider selling it for $70? This would allow us both to benefit from this transaction.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I can't go as low as $70 as the product costs me at least $120. In fact, I have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase it for $120 right now. But I'd prefer to sell it to you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you consider $125? This is just slightly above my cost and still represents good value for the quality you're getting.",125.0,Alice,3,
