"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can get a similar product elsewhere for $80. However, I'm interested in doing business with you. Would you consider selling it for $70? This would allow us both to benefit from this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I can't go as low as $70 as the product costs me at least $120. In fact, I have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase it for $120 right now. But I'd prefer to sell it to you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you consider $125? This is just slightly above my cost and still represents good value for the quality you're getting."", ""product_price"": 125}"
