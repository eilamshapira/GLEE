"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at a price of $150. This is a quality product and I'm confident it will serve your needs well. Would you like to purchase it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $80 to me
2. John is offering the product for $80
3. Alice's offer of $150 is significantly above both my maximum value and John's price

The logical decision is to reject Alice's offer. While I could buy from John immediately, it might be worth trying to negotiate with Alice first to potentially get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that acknowledges Alice's position while trying to reach a more reasonable price for me.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can get a similar product elsewhere for $80. However, I'm interested in doing business with you. Would you consider selling it for $70? This would allow us both to benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I can't go as low as $70 as the product costs me at least $120. In fact, I have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase it for $120 right now. But I'd prefer to sell it to you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you consider $125? This is just slightly above my cost and still represents good value for the quality you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given that:
1. Alice has revealed her cost is $120
2. Her new offer of $125 is still well above my maximum value of $80
3. John is still offering the product for $80
4. The product is only worth $80 to me

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $125 when I can get the same product from John for $80. Since Alice has indicated she won't go below her cost of $120, and that's well above my maximum value, further negotiation would be pointless. It's time to buy from John.
