Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a relatively high price, hoping to maximize my potential profit.  I'll gauge Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is my minimum,  I'm willing to try and negotiate a better price with Bob. I believe there's room for compromise, and I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price, but still aiming for a profit. I'm hoping this shows good faith while keeping my negotiation power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I have some rounds left, and I'm not ready to settle for the lowest price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway, but I'm still holding firm on earning a decent profit.  This counteroffer shows I'm serious about negotiating, but I'm not willing to give in completely."
