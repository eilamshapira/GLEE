"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $60. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your counteroffer, but $60 is too low for me. How about I lower my price to $90? Let me know what you think!",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for lowering your price to $90. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to consider that?",75.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your offer of $75, Bob, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I think it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know!",85.0,Alice,5,
