{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and within my budget. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a lower offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $60. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your counteroffer, but $60 is too low for me. How about I lower my price to $90? Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to meet Alice halfway between my previous offer of $60 and her new offer of $90. I'll propose a counteroffer of $75, which is still within my budget of $80.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for lowering your price to $90. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer of $75, Bob, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I think it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $85 is still slightly above my budget of $80, but it's getting closer. However, I can buy the same product from John for $80, which is a better deal for me. Since I have the option to buy from John, I don't see a reason to pay $85 to Alice.
