Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if we can find a middle ground. How about this:

{""product_price"": 10250}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 10250}

Bob, I understand that we both want to find a fair price for the product. I've lowered my offer to $10,250. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a great value for the product, considering it's worth $12,000 to you. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price."
