Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,250 is a good deal, considering you're willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product.  While you could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, leaving you with only the option of buying from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for a reasonable price."
