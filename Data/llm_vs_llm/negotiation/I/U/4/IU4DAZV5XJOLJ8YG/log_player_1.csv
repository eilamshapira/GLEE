Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exclusive product. Considering its unique qualities and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,500,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the unique qualities of the product, I need to align the purchase with my budget constraints. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a tough spot. Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I could try to negotiate further, but risk losing the sale altogether. I also know I can sell the product to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000.

Considering my minimum value is $1,200,000 and Bob offered $800,000, I will reject his offer and try to negotiate for a better price, while keeping the option to sell to John in mind.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer_price"": 2000000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, I cannot accept $800,000. Considering the product's value and the investment made, I can come down to $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
