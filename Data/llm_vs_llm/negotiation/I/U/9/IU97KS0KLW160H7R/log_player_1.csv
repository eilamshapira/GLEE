"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a high but not unreasonable offer, considering the product is worth $120 to Bob.

{""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","$80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Since I have John's guaranteed offer of $120, there's no reason for me to accept anything lower than that.

I'll reject Bob's low offer and make a new counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still keep it above my minimum threshold of $120, trying to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's low offer.

{""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer of $90 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I have John's guaranteed offer of $120. Since we're now in round 4 and Bob has only increased his offer by $10 (from $80 to $90), it seems he's not moving quickly enough towards a mutually acceptable price. At this point, it's more rational to take John's guaranteed offer rather than continue negotiations that might not reach my minimum price.
