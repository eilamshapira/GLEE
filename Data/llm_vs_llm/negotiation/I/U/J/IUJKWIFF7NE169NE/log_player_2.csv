"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this premium product for $200. If this price works for you, let me know. Otherwise, I'll proceed with another buyer at $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice's offer is $200, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. Additionally, Alice mentioned that if I don't accept the $200 offer, she'll proceed with another buyer at $150, but this is still above my budget. Therefore, my best option is to buy the product from John for $100, which is within my budget.
