"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I believe the product has potential, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I could consider a purchase closer to $1000000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that my initial price may have been steep, but I still believe the product has immense value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I'd like to propose a middle ground.",3000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $3000000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1250000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I still think the product's value lies closer to my initial assessment. I'm willing to come down further, but I need to feel confident that I'm getting a fair price. I'd like to propose $2500000.",2500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $2500000 is still a significant stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers at $1500000. This is my final offer, as I can secure the product elsewhere at this price.  ",1500000.0,Bob,6,
