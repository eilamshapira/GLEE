Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I believe the product has potential, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I could consider a purchase closer to $1000000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $2500000 is still a significant stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers at $1500000. This is my final offer, as I can secure the product elsewhere at this price.

I've decided to accept Bob's final offer of $1,500,000. While it's still lower than my initial valuation, it's a significant increase from his initial offer and higher than the alternative of selling to John for $1,000,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to close the deal at this price."
