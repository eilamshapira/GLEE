"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), I should not accept this offer. In fact, since John's price is equal to my maximum value and Alice's initial offer is so high, it would be best to buy from John immediately rather than enter a negotiation with Alice, who clearly started with a very high price.
