"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I can actually get it from another seller for $120 as well. Since we're negotiating directly, I was hoping we could agree on a better price. Would you consider selling it for $90? This would be a win-win situation as I would save some money, and you would make a quick sale.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about being able to get the product from another seller for $120. However, I'm not comfortable selling it for $90. I can do better than that, but I still need to make a decent profit. I'd be willing to sell it to you for $110. This way, you'll still save some money compared to buying from the other seller, and I'll get a fair price for the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
