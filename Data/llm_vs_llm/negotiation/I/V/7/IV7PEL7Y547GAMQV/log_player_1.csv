"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I can actually get it from another seller for $120 as well. Since we're negotiating directly, I was hoping we could agree on a better price. Would you consider selling it for $90? This would be a win-win situation as I would save some money, and you would make a quick sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

My counteroffer: 
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about being able to get the product from another seller for $120. However, I'm not comfortable selling it for $90. I can do better than that, but I still need to make a decent profit. I'd be willing to sell it to you for $110. This way, you'll still save some money compared to buying from the other seller, and I'll get a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 110}"
