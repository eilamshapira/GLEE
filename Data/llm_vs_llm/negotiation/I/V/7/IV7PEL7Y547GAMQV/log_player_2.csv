"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm open to negotiations, but I'll start with a price of $120. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $120
2. John is also selling it for $120
3. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
4. Since Alice is open to negotiations, I might be able to get a better price from her

Given these factors, I should reject Alice's initial offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's no risk in trying because I can always fall back to John's $120 offer if negotiations with Alice don't work out.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower to leave room for negotiation but not so low as to appear unreasonable.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I can actually get it from another seller for $120 as well. Since we're negotiating directly, I was hoping we could agree on a better price. Would you consider selling it for $90? This would be a win-win situation as I would save some money, and you would make a quick sale."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about being able to get the product from another seller for $120. However, I'm not comfortable selling it for $90. I can do better than that, but I still need to make a decent profit. I'd be willing to sell it to you for $110. This way, you'll still save some money compared to buying from the other seller, and I'll get a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $120 to $110
2. This is a $10 saving compared to John's price
3. Alice seems willing to negotiate but also wants to maintain a decent profit
4. We might be able to get a slightly better price, but there's also a risk of losing this good offer

This is actually a good offer as it represents a meaningful discount from both the initial price and John's price. While we might be able to negotiate further, the potential additional savings might not be worth the risk of losing this deal. $110 is a fair price that benefits both parties.
