"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the quality of your item, but $15000 is beyond my budget. I am willing to pay $6500 for the product. Let me know if we can make a deal at this price.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, I need to be clear that $6500 is significantly below what I can accept. This product has substantial value, and I already have another buyer willing to pay $10000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $13500, which I believe represents a fair price considering the quality and value of the product. Would this work for you?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13500 is still too high for me. I can increase my offer to $7000. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $7000 is still substantially below what I need for this product. As I mentioned, I have another buyer ready at $10000, which is the absolute minimum I can accept. Since I'd prefer to do business with you, I'm willing to offer you the product at $12000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects both the true value of the product and my desire to work with you. Can we reach an agreement at this price?",12000.0,Alice,5,
