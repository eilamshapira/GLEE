"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, I need to be clear that $6500 is significantly below what I can accept. This product has substantial value, and I already have another buyer willing to pay $10000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $13500, which I believe represents a fair price considering the quality and value of the product. Would this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $7000 is still substantially below what I need for this product. As I mentioned, I have another buyer ready at $10000, which is the absolute minimum I can accept. Since I'd prefer to do business with you, I'm willing to offer you the product at $12000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects both the true value of the product and my desire to work with you. Can we reach an agreement at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
