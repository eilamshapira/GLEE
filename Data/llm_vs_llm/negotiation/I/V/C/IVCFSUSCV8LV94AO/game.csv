"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to lower my offer to $18000. Let me know if this works for you.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"Hi Bob, I see you're really interested in the product. I can come down a bit more to meet you halfway. How about $15000? This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll get.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $15000 is still more than double what I can afford. The highest I can realistically offer is $7000. I'm really pushing my limits here.",7000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your situation and your interest in the product. Let's try to find a middle ground. I can go down to $13000. This is my final offer before considering other options. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,7,
