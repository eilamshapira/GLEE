"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $15,000 and Alice's offer is at that price, rejecting the offer allows you to consider other options. Buying from John at the same price offers no advantage."
