Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I believe $1100000 is quite high considering market conditions. I understand the value of your product, but I would be comfortable paying $900000, which I believe is a fair price that would work well for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us. My next offer will be $1,000,000. This price is still below what the product is worth to Bob, but closer to my initial offer, giving us both a chance to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
