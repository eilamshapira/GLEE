"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'm looking for $1100000, which I think is a fair value considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,200,000
2. Alice's offer is $1,100,000
3. I know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice
4. John's fixed price is $1,200,000 (my maximum)

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below my maximum value but significantly above her own value ($800,000). There's room for negotiation here, and I should try to get a better price since Alice has a lot of margin to work with.

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. Even if negotiations don't go well, I always have John's offer as a backup.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I believe $1,100,000 is quite high considering market conditions. I understand the value of your product, but I would be comfortable paying $900,000, which I believe is a fair price that would work well for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the market conditions, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer of $900000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I believe $1000000 is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you while also considering the current market. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the updated situation:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $1,100,000 to $1,000,000
2. This is a $100,000 reduction from her initial offer
3. The price is still $200,000 above her value ($800,000)
4. It's $200,000 below my maximum value ($1,200,000)
5. She's showing willingness to negotiate by meeting me ""halfway""

This is a significant improvement from the initial offer, and Alice seems to be negotiating in good faith. While there might still be some room for negotiation, there's also a risk that pushing too hard might make Alice less willing to negotiate further. The current price of $1,000,000 represents a good savings compared to John's price ($200,000 less), and it's a reasonable compromise.
