"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $150 to me and only $80 to Bob, it would be most logical to sell to John for $150. However, I'll start the negotiation with Bob to see if there's any possibility of getting an even better deal.

I'll start with a high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer of $60 is far below my minimum acceptable value of $150, and it's even below his own valuation of $80. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, and Bob's initial counteroffer is so low, it's unlikely we'll reach a mutually beneficial agreement. It would be most profitable to take the guaranteed $150 from John.
