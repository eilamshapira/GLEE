"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this remarkable product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and possesses immense potential. Considering its unique qualities and the value it could unlock for you, I'm offering it for sale at $1500000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me. Alice is offering it for $1,500,000. That's way too high. If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy it from John for $800,000, which is my maximum willingness to pay.
