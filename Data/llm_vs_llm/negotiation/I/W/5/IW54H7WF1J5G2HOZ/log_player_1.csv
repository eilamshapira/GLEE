Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 12000}

Rationale: Since I know that:
1. The product is worth no less than $12,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $12,000
3. The product is only worth $8,000 to Bob
4. Bob will likely reject any offer above $8,000

There's no reason for me to offer the product to Bob for less than $12,000. If Bob rejects the offer (which he likely will since it's above his valuation), I can sell to John for $12,000. If by some chance Bob accepts, I still get $12,000. This maximizes my profit while maintaining my minimum acceptable price."
