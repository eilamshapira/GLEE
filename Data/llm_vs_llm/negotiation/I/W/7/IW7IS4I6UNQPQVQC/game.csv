"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $10000 to you, so I'm willing to let it go for $9500.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to counter with $7000. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $8500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $8500 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $7500? I think this is a fair compromise given our previous offers.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $7500 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $8250? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. ",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $8250 is still a bit steep for me. Let's meet in the middle at $7800. I believe this is a reasonable offer that reflects our negotiations so far.",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $7800 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to drop to $8000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  I don't want to go any lower, but I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Alice,7,
