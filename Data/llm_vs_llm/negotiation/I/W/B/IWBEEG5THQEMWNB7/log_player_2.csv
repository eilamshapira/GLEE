"Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $80 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $175
3. John is willing to sell it for $80

It's clear that Alice's offer ($175) is way above what the product is worth to me ($80). Additionally, John's offer ($80) exactly matches my maximum valuation.

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer when:
a) It's much higher than my valuation
b) I have a better alternative with John's offer

The logical choice is to buy from John at $80.
