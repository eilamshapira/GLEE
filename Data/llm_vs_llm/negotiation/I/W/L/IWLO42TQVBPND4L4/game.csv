Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you will love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250. Let me know what you think!,250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $250 is well above my budget for this product. I should mention that I've found the same product from another seller for $80. But I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to sell it for $60? That would give me a reason to choose you over the other seller.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I appreciate your willingness to work with me. While I can't go as low as $60, I can offer you the product for $200. I believe it's a fair price given its value. Let me know your thoughts!",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. However, $200 is still much higher than what I can pay. I need to be transparent - this product is worth no more than $80 to me, and I have a firm offer from another seller at exactly $80. I'd really like to buy from you instead, but I can only offer $65 at most. This would save me some money compared to the other option and give you a sale. Would that work for you?",65.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! Thank you for your honesty, and I appreciate your continued interest. While I understand your budget constraints, I still need to ensure I get a fair value for the product. How about I sell it to you for $180? I believe it's a great deal considering the product's quality. Let me know if that works for you!",180.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be very clear - I have a guaranteed option to purchase this exact product for $80 from another seller. My absolute maximum budget is $80, as that's what the product is worth to me. I'm still interested in purchasing from you and would offer $70, which would save me some money compared to my alternative. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to go with the other seller. Thank you for understanding.",70.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I appreciate your understanding and your patience in this negotiation. I know you have a strong offer from another seller, but I strongly believe my product is worth more. How about I sell it to you for $175? This way, you get a quality product from me, and I can ensure I'm earning a fair price. Let me know if that works!",175.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but I think we may be at an impasse. You've come down to $175, which I understand reflects what you believe the product is worth. However, I need to emphasize that I cannot pay more than $80 for this product - that is its maximum value to me, and I have a confirmed offer at exactly $80 from another seller. As a final attempt to do business with you, I can offer $75. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to accept the other offer. Thank you for your time and consideration.",75.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I understand that $75 is your best offer, but I still need to find a middle ground that works for both of us. How about I let it go for $150? It's significantly less than the value of the product, but it allows you to purchase it directly from me. My offer stands, and I hope we can find a way to make this work!",150.0,Alice,9,
