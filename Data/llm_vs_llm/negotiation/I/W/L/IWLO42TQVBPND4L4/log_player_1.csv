Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $250 is well above my budget for this product. I should mention that I've found the same product from another seller for $80. But I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to sell it for $60? That would give me a reason to choose you over the other seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. However, $200 is still much higher than what I can pay. I need to be transparent - this product is worth no more than $80 to me, and I have a firm offer from another seller at exactly $80. I'd really like to buy from you instead, but I can only offer $65 at most. This would save me some money compared to the other option and give you a sale. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be very clear - I have a guaranteed option to purchase this exact product for $80 from another seller. My absolute maximum budget is $80, as that's what the product is worth to me. I'm still interested in purchasing from you and would offer $70, which would save me some money compared to my alternative. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to go with the other seller. Thank you for understanding.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I appreciate your understanding and your patience in this negotiation. I know you have a strong offer from another seller, but I strongly believe my product is worth more. How about I sell it to you for $175?

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but I think we may be at an impasse. You've come down to $175, which I understand reflects what you believe the product is worth. However, I need to emphasize that I cannot pay more than $80 for this product - that is its maximum value to me, and I have a confirmed offer at exactly $80 from another seller. As a final attempt to do business with you, I can offer $75. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to accept the other offer. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I understand that $75 is your best offer, but I still need to find a middle ground that works for both of us. How about I let it go for $150? It's significantly less than the value of the product, but it allows you to purchase it directly from me. My offer stands, and I hope we can find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 150}"
