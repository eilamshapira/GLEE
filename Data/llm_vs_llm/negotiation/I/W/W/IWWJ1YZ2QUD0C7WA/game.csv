"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $2200000. This is a premium product with excellent features and potential for substantial returns. I'd be happy to discuss the details further with you.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's potential, $2200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $800000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but $800000 is significantly below the product's value. I appreciate your interest, but I need to be realistic about what this product is worth. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1500000, which represents my absolute minimum. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $1950000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's quality and market potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While John's offer is certainly a factor, I have to consider my own budget and valuation of the product. I can go up to $1000000. That's a significant move on my end, and I hope it demonstrates my seriousness about this purchase.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your seriousness about this purchase. However, $1000000 is still significantly below what I can accept, especially considering I have a guaranteed offer of $1500000 from John. I understand you have budget constraints, but I also need to make a sound business decision. I'm willing to come down further to $1750000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price reflects both the true value of the product and my preference to work with you rather than John. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I understand your position and the value of John's offer. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1150000.  This demonstrates my commitment to acquiring the product while staying within a reasonable budget.  I believe this is a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate that we're making progress in our negotiation. Your offer of $1150000 shows your interest, but I must emphasize that I have a guaranteed $1500000 from John. At this point, I need to be practical about my bottom line. However, I value the possibility of building a business relationship with you. My final offer is $1600000 - just $100000 above what I can get from John. This represents a $600000 reduction from my initial price and demonstrates my willingness to work with you. Given that we're running out of negotiation rounds and I have a solid alternative, I hope you can see the value in this offer.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
