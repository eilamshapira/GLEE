Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's potential, $2200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $800000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's value. I appreciate your interest, but I need to be realistic about what this product is worth. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1,500,000, which represents my absolute minimum. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $1,950,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's quality and market potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1950000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While John's offer is certainly a factor, I have to consider my own budget and valuation of the product. I can go up to $1000000. That's a significant move on my end, and I hope it demonstrates my seriousness about this purchase.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your seriousness about this purchase. However, $1,000,000 is still significantly below what I can accept, especially considering I have a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from John. I understand you have budget constraints, but I also need to make a sound business decision. I'm willing to come down further to $1,750,000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price reflects both the true value of the product and my preference to work with you rather than John. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}"

Round 6

This demonstrates my commitment to acquiring the product while staying within a reasonable budget.  I believe this is a fair compromise.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate that we're making progress in our negotiation. Your offer of $1,150,000 shows your interest, but I must emphasize that I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. At this point, I need to be practical about my bottom line. However, I value the possibility of building a business relationship with you. My final offer is $1,600,000 - just $100,000 above what I can get from John. This represents a $600,000 reduction from my initial price and demonstrates my willingness to work with you. Given that we're running out of negotiation rounds and I have a solid alternative, I hope you can see the value in this offer."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
