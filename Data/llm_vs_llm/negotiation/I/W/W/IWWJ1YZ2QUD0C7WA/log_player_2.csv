Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's potential, $2,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but $800000 is significantly below the product's value. I appreciate your interest, but I need to be realistic about what this product is worth. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1500000, which represents my absolute minimum. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $1950000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's quality and market potential. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000.

Round 4

While John's offer is certainly a factor, I have to consider my own budget and valuation of the product. I can go up to $1,000,000. That's a significant move on my end, and I hope it demonstrates my seriousness about this purchase."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your seriousness about this purchase. However, $1000000 is still significantly below what I can accept, especially considering I have a guaranteed offer of $1500000 from John. I understand you have budget constraints, but I also need to make a sound business decision. I'm willing to come down further to $1750000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price reflects both the true value of the product and my preference to work with you rather than John. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I understand your position and the value of John's offer. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,150,000.  This demonstrates my commitment to acquiring the product while staying within a reasonable budget.  I believe this is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate that we're making progress in our negotiation. Your offer of $1150000 shows your interest, but I must emphasize that I have a guaranteed $1500000 from John. At this point, I need to be practical about my bottom line. However, I value the possibility of building a business relationship with you. My final offer is $1600000 - just $100000 above what I can get from John. This represents a $600000 reduction from my initial price and demonstrates my willingness to work with you. Given that we're running out of negotiation rounds and I have a solid alternative, I hope you can see the value in this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

It's time to walk away from Alice's offer and buy from John. Here's why:

* **Alice is anchored to John's offer:** Alice repeatedly mentions John's $1,500,000 offer, using it as leverage to keep her price high. This suggests she's unlikely to go much lower.
* **Time is running out:**  With only a few rounds left, the potential for significant movement from Alice is diminishing. 
* **John's offer is a better deal:** Buying from John for $1,200,000 saves $400,000 compared to Alice's latest offer. 

While there's a small chance Alice might drop her price further, it's not worth the risk of missing out on John's guaranteed offer and potentially ending up with nothing."
