"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It makes no sense to accept Alice's offer of $150 when:
1. The product is only worth $80 to me
2. I can buy it from John for $80

I'll reject and make a counteroffer to Alice, as there might be a chance to get it for even less than $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 50}

I'll offer $50 to Alice. This is significantly lower than John's price of $80, which gives room for negotiation if Alice counters. Since I don't know Alice's cost, starting low allows me to potentially get a better deal than John's $80 while still having room to increase my offer if needed. If Alice rejects and the negotiation doesn't work out, I can always fall back on John's offer of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll continue to reject because:
1. Alice's new offer of $140 is still well above my maximum value of $80
2. It's still higher than John's guaranteed price of $80
3. Alice has shown some flexibility by reducing the price from $150 to $140, which suggests there might be room for further negotiation

I'll make another counteroffer to try to get a better price than John's $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 65}

I'll increase my offer to $65. This is still below John's price of $80, which gives me room to negotiate while potentially getting a better deal. Since Alice dropped her price from $150 to $140, she shows willingness to negotiate, but her price is still too high. By offering $65 (up from my previous $50), I'm showing willingness to meet somewhere in the middle while still maintaining a good margin below my maximum acceptable price of $80."
