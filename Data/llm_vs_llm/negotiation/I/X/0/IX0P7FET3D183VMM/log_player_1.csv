Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that the product is worth $10,000 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should not sell to Bob for less than $10,000. Since Bob values the product at $8,000, he will not accept any offer at or above $8,000. Therefore, I will offer Bob the product at $10,000, knowing he will reject it, and then I will sell to John.
