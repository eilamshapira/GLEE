"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Given that the product is worth $80 to Alice and no more than $100 to me, I should reject this offer of $95. Alice has room to reduce the price since her cost is $80, and $95 is too close to John's price of $100. I can make a counteroffer that's lower and still profitable for Alice while saving me money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 85}

I'm offering $85 because:
1. It's above Alice's cost of $80, so she can still make a $5 profit
2. It's significantly below John's price of $100
3. It's a reasonable reduction from Alice's initial offer of $95
4. If Alice rejects this, there's still room for negotiation between $85 and $95"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer because:
1. Alice has moved down from $95 to $92, showing she's willing to negotiate
2. There's still significant room between her cost ($80) and this offer ($92)
3. The current offer is still only $8 less than John's price
4. Since she countered my $85 offer, a middle ground might be possible
5. I can make another counteroffer to try to reach a more favorable price"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 88}

I'm offering $88 because:
1. It's a reasonable increase from my previous offer of $85
2. It splits the difference between my last offer ($85) and Alice's current offer ($92)
3. It still gives Alice a good profit margin ($8 above her cost of $80)
4. It's $12 less than John's price, giving me significant savings
5. This compromise shows I'm willing to move up from my initial position while still seeking a fair deal"

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

I'll accept this offer because:
1. Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $95 to $90
2. The price is $10 less than John's alternative ($100)
3. We've negotiated back and forth, and $90 seems to be a fair compromise
4. Further negotiation might risk Alice walking away or becoming less flexible
5. The price gives Alice a reasonable profit ($10 above her cost) while giving me a good savings compared to John's price"
