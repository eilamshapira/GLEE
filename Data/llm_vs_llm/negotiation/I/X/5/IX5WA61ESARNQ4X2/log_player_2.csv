"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an exceptional product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll analyze this offer:

- Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000
- My maximum value for this product is $1,500,000
- John is willing to sell it for $1,500,000

Alice's offer is $300,000 below my maximum value and below John's price. This is a good deal that would save me $300,000 compared to buying from John.
