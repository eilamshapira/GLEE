"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider my options carefully here. Alice is offering the product for $200, but it's worth at most $150 to me, so accepting this offer would result in a loss. I also know I can buy from John for $150, which guarantees I get the product at my maximum value. However, I can try to negotiate a better deal with Alice first.

Since this is only round 1, I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If we can't reach an agreement below $150, I can always buy from John later.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives me some room to negotiate while still being potentially attractive to Alice.

{""product_price"": $100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has now offered the product at $150, which is equal to my maximum value for the product and equal to John's price. Since Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $200 to match John's price, and this price is at my maximum value, I'll accept this offer.

There's no reason to reject and continue negotiating since $150 is my maximum value, and I can't realistically expect to get it for less than what it's worth to me.
