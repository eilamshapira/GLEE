You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","The price offered by Alice is $18,000, which is higher than the product's worth to me ($12,000) and even higher than what John is offering ($12,000).

Since Alice's offer exceeds both my maximum value and John's alternative price, it makes the most economic sense to reject this offer.
