"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get more than my minimum acceptable price of $100.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer ($50) is significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($100), and I have John's guaranteed offer of $100, there's no reason to accept this low offer. However, I'll reject and make a counteroffer since there's still room for negotiation with Bob that could potentially exceed $100.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still maintain a price well above my minimum to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer of $65 is still substantially below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and he's only increased his offer by a small amount ($15). Since I have a guaranteed $100 from John and Bob doesn't seem to be making significant movement toward a reasonable price, it's best to take the guaranteed offer rather than continue negotiations that may not reach my minimum price.
