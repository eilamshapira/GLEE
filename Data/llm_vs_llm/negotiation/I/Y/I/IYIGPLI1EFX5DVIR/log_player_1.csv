"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I want to see how Bob reacts and gauge his interest."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit.  I'm not ready to settle for $900,000 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product."

Bob is inching closer to my minimum, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can squeeze out a little more."

Bob is still $100,000 below my minimum, and we're already halfway through the rounds. I'm not confident we'll reach an agreement before the deadline, so I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000."
