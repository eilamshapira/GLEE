"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to consider if I can get a better deal from Alice than the $1,500,000 that John is offering.

Since Alice's initial offer is also $1,500,000 (the same as my maximum value and John's price), there's no advantage to accepting this offer immediately. I should try to negotiate for a lower price from Alice since I still have 10 rounds of negotiation available.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a significantly lower counteroffer to leave room for negotiation.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her price from $1,500,000 to $1,250,000, which is a substantial reduction of $250,000. This is already better than buying from John for $1,500,000. However, since we still have plenty of negotiation rounds left, I'll try to get an even better price from Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by lowering her price significantly. I'll raise my offer from the previous $900,000, but still aim for a good deal.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has lowered her price again to $1,200,000, which is now $300,000 less than John's price. We're making good progress in the negotiation. Since we still have several rounds left and Alice seems willing to continue lowering her price, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer to try getting an even better deal.
