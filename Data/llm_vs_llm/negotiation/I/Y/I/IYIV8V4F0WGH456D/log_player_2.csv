"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I’m pleased to offer you my premium product. Based on its unique value, I’m setting the price at $1200000. I believe this represents an exceptional opportunity. Let me know if you’re interested or if you’d like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","**{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**

Let's start the negotiation process. Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, which is $800,000. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","**{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I find the price to be quite high. I'm looking to spend no more than $500,000 on this product. Would you be open to negotiating the price down to this amount?"", ""product_price"": 500000}**

I've started the negotiation process with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within my budget. Let's see how Alice responds to this counteroffer."
