"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $120 seems a bit high. Given current market conditions, I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand you're looking for a better deal, $90 is too close to my minimum acceptable price. The product has exceptional quality and features that justify a higher value. I can offer it to you for $110, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents good value considering what this product is worth. Would this work for you?",110.0,Alice,3,
