"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $120 seems a bit high. Given current market conditions, I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

While I understand you're looking for a better deal, $90 is too close to my minimum acceptable price. The product has exceptional quality and features that justify a higher value.
