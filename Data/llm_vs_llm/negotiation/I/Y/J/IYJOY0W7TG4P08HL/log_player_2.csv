"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe will be valuable for you. I'm offering it at a price of $120. This price reflects the quality and value of the product. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this strategically:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. Alice's offer is $120, which is below my maximum
3. However, I know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation
4. John's price ($150) is the highest, so that's my last resort
5. I should try to negotiate with Alice for a better price

Based on this analysis, I should reject Alice's initial offer of $120 and make a counteroffer. This gives me the opportunity to potentially get a better price while still having John's offer as a backup.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but leaves room for negotiation:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $120 seems a bit high. Given current market conditions, I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand you're looking for a better deal, $90 is too close to my minimum acceptable price. The product has exceptional quality and features that justify a higher value. I can offer it to you for $110, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents good value considering what this product is worth. Would this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has dropped her price from $120 to $110, showing willingness to negotiate
2. The price is still well below my maximum value ($150)
3. While it's above Alice's cost ($80), the $110 price represents a reasonable middle ground
4. We could continue negotiating, but:
   - Alice seems firm about not going too low
   - Further negotiation might risk losing the deal
   - The current price offers me a good $40 savings compared to John's price
5. The $110 price point seems like a fair compromise

Given this analysis, I think it's wise to accept this offer. We've achieved a reasonable price reduction, and continuing to negotiate might not yield significantly better results.
