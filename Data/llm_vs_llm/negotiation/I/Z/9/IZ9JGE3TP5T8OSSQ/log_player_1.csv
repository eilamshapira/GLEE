Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a reasonably high offer while leaving room for potential negotiation if needed.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $600,000 since it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 (John's offer). Bob's offer is only half of what I can get from John, so there's no reason to accept it.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

My next offer to Bob will be $1,500,000. I'm lowering the price from my initial offer to show some flexibility in negotiation, while still maintaining a price well above my minimum threshold."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1,500,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer of $700,000 is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000. Since Bob's second offer only increased by $100,000, it suggests he might not be willing to reach a price point that would be acceptable to me (above $1,200,000). At this point, I think it's best to end the negotiation with Bob and take John's guaranteed offer.
