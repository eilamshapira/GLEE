"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have this amazing product I think you'd love. Considering its value to you, I'm offering it to you for a great price."", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Okay, let's see... I could sell to John for $100, or I could accept Bob's $105 offer. That's a $5 difference. I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer Bob. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to go down a bit, but I think the product is worth more than $105."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice. $110 is still a bit high for me. My maximum is $108. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Okay, $108... Hmm. My goal is to earn as much as possible. I could go back and forth with Bob for a while, but there's a risk he'll lowball me further, or that I'll run out of rounds. $108 is better than $100 from John. I'll take it.
