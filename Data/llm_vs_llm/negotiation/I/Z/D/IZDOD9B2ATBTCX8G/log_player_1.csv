"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product to offer you today. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. How about I offer you $100 instead? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $100 is my minimum acceptable price (since I can get that from John), and I believe Bob might be willing to pay more based on his willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but given the quality and value of this product, I cannot go that low. However, I'm willing to be flexible. Would you consider $150? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. Thanks for coming down a bit. However, I was thinking of a lower price. How about $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $120. This is a better deal than selling to John for $100, and given that we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, this seems like a fair compromise that gives me a reasonable profit."
