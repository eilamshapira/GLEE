"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but  $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $950000.  Let's see if we can work something out.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I canâ€™t go as low as $950000. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but  $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle on $1000000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
