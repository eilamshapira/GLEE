It's worth exploring if we can get a lower price from Alice.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle on $1,000,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I still can't accept $1000000. How about we settle on $1030000? I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000

Okay, I'm willing to meet Alice halfway at this point.  $1,030,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal."
