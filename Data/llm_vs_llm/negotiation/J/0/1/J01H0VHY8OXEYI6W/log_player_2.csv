"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $2,000,000 for the product:

This price is well above my maximum value for the product, which is $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would mean overpaying by $800,000.

John is offering me the same product for exactly $1,200,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

The obvious choice here is to buy from John instead of accepting Alice's significantly higher price.
