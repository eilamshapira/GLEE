"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you and I believe you'll find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's initial offer of $120 is at the upper limit of what I'm willing to pay, and I can get the same product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in accepting Alice's offer immediately. However, I also don't want to give up the potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. Therefore, the best course of action is to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the hopes of getting a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable, considering I'm willing to pay up to $120. A good starting point could be to offer a price that is significantly lower than my maximum budget, to leave room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to propose a lower price."", ""product_price"": $90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position. However, the product holds significant value. I can offer it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has come down from her initial offer of $120 to $110, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming to save as much money as possible. Since $110 is closer to my budget limit of $120, but I believe there might be some room for further negotiation, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

This time, I'll aim for a price that's between my previous offer of $90 and Alice's current offer of $110, to see if we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll send a new counteroffer: 

{""message"": ""Thank you, Alice, for considering my previous offer and for your new proposal. I appreciate the reduction to $110. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would that be something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": $100}"
