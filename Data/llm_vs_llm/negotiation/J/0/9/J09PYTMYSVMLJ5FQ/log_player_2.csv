"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. Given its value and the interest it has generated, I can offer it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the worth of the product and its potential for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Alice's offer is less than your $1,000,000 limit, you know John will sell it for $1,000,000. There's a chance Alice might come down in price, so it makes sense to reject this offer and see if she counters with a better one."
