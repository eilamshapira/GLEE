Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a price for the product that maximizes my earnings while giving Bob an incentive to accept.

From my perspective:
- The product is worth at least $8,000 to me
- I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $8,000
- The product is worth $15,000 to Bob

Since Bob values the product at $15,000, he would theoretically be willing to pay anything up to that amount. However, if I price it too close to $15,000, he might reject the offer since he would gain very little value.

To make the deal attractive to Bob while maximizing my earnings, I should offer a price that gives him some discount from his maximum valuation but still gives me significantly more than my $8,000 floor.

A fair price would be $12,000, which:
- Gives me $4,000 more than my alternative option
- Gives Bob a $3,000 consumer surplus (he values it at $15,000 but pays $12,000)
- Creates a win-win situation
