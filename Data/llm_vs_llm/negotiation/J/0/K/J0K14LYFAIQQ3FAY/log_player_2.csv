"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll find our price of $1000000 quite reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's initial offer is already at the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,000,000), there's no room for negotiation that would benefit me. However, I might as well try to negotiate to see if Alice is willing to lower the price. If not, I can always buy from John for the same price. Therefore, my decision is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer, hoping to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable considering I don't know the product's value to her. A common strategy in negotiation is to start with a lower offer to leave room for compromise. Since my maximum budget is $1,000,000, I'll start by offering half of that amount.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I believe your product has value, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. While I appreciate your offer, $500000 is a bit lower than I can accept. However, I'm willing to work with you on the price. Let's meet in the middle at $750000. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has made a counteroffer of $750,000, which is still below my maximum budget of $1,000,000 but higher than my initial counteroffer of $500,000. Since she's willing to negotiate and has already come down from $1,000,000 to $750,000, it shows some flexibility. However, I'd like to try and get an even better deal if possible.

Given that Alice has met me halfway between my offer and her initial price, the next step could be to try and split the difference again or make a more modest adjustment. The difference between $500,000 and $750,000 is $250,000. Meeting halfway again would mean adding $125,000 to my initial counteroffer, making it $625,000.

I'll make a counteroffer of $625,000 to see if Alice is willing to come down further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my counteroffer is: 
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I understand that $500,000 might be too low, but I'm also trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet in the middle of $500,000 and $750,000? I'd be willing to pay $625,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 625000}"
