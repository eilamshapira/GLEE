"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer or reject it and buy from John.

Alice is offering the product for $120, which is exactly the maximum I'm willing to pay for it (as it's worth no more than $120 to me). 

John is also offering the product for $120.

Since both offers are at the same price of $120, and both would cost me the same amount, there's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other. 

In this case, I might as well accept Alice's offer since it's available right now.
