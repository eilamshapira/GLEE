Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a price that I think reflects its value."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $50. I believe this is a fair price, considering I can also buy it from John for $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually agreeable price. Since Bob mentioned he can also buy it from John for $100, I'll try to meet him halfway between my initial offer and John's price. 

My counteroffer: $150"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $50 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I also know that I can sell the product to John for $120. Considering that, I'd like to propose a middle ground between my initial offer and John's price. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, especially since I know I can buy it from John for $100. I'd like to propose a price that's closer to John's offer, while still giving you a better deal than you'd get from him. How about we meet in the middle of your new offer and John's price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $125 is higher than the $120 I can get from John, and we've already negotiated down from my initial offer of $200, I think $125 is a reasonable price. It's a compromise that works for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by pushing for a higher price."
