You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $50 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I also know that I can sell the product to John for $120. Considering that, I'd like to propose a middle ground between my initial offer and John's price. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial price.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, especially since I know I can buy it from John for $100. I'd like to propose a price that's closer to John's offer, while still giving you a better deal than you'd get from him. How about we meet in the middle of your new offer and John's price?"", ""product_price"": 125}"
