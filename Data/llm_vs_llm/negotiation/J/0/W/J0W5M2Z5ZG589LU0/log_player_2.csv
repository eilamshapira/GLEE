"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $15,000 is a bit high for my budget. How about we settle around $10,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Alice is coming down, but we're still close to John's price. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for a similar product at a lower price point.  If you're able to come down to $11,000, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

This message does a few things:

* **Acknowledges Alice's compromise:** This helps maintain a positive negotiating atmosphere.
* **Introduces competition:** Even though we haven't explicitly said John's price is $12,000, implying we have another offer can incentivize Alice to be more flexible.
* **Presents a firm but fair counter:** $11,000 gives us some room to negotiate while staying below John's offer.
* **Creates urgency:** By expressing our desire to close the deal ""today,"" we add a subtle pressure for Alice to respond favorably."
