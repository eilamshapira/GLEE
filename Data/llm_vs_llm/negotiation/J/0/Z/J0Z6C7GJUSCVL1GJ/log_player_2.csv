"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: Pay $1,000,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: Pay $1,000,000

Since Alice's offer ($1,000,000) is exactly the same as John's price ($1,000,000), and both prices are equal to my maximum value for the product, there's no advantage in choosing one over the other. I might as well accept Alice's offer since she made it first.
