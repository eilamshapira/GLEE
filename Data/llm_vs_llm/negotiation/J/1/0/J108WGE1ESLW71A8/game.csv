"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Based on its features and market value, I'm offering it at $1800000. This product has significant potential and represents a great investment opportunity. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1800000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's features and market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, I need to point out that $900000 is significantly below the product's market value. My minimum acceptable price is $1400000, which is already a substantial reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects the true value of what you're getting. The product has exceptional quality and performance metrics that justify this investment.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for your willingness to lower the price. I appreciate the exceptional quality and performance metrics of the product, but I still need to find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1050000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise between our positions.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for moving up in your offer, which shows your genuine interest in the product. However, $1050000 is still below my minimum acceptable threshold. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle at $1350000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it represents a significant discount from my initial offer. As you know, I have another interested buyer at $1200000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to compromise and for sharing the information about the other interested buyer. I appreciate your transparency. Considering this new information, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1150000. This price is closer to the middle ground, and I believe it's a fair offer given the product's value and the presence of another interested buyer at $1200000.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your improved offer. While we're getting closer, I must be transparent that I can't accept less than what my alternative buyer John is offering, which is $1200000. This is my absolute minimum, as it represents the product's baseline value to me. I'm willing to offer you the product at $1250000, which is still a good value considering its quality and potential return on investment. If we can agree on a price that's at least slightly above my alternative option, I'd be happy to finalize our deal.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
