Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1800000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's features and market value.

While I understand budget constraints, I need to point out that $900,000 is significantly below the product's market value.

The product has exceptional quality and performance metrics that justify this investment."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"

I appreciate the exceptional quality and performance metrics of the product, but I still need to find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1050000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise between our positions.

This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it represents a significant discount from my initial offer.

While we're getting closer, I must be transparent that I can't accept less than what my alternative buyer John is offering, which is $1,200,000.

I'm willing to offer you the product at $1,250,000, which is still a good value considering its quality and potential return on investment.
