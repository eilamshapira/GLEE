I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle at $1350000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it represents a significant discount from my initial offer. As you know, I have another interested buyer at $1200000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your improved offer. While we're getting closer, I must be transparent that I can't accept less than what my alternative buyer John is offering, which is $1200000. This is my absolute minimum, as it represents the product's baseline value to me. I'm willing to offer you the product at $1250000, which is still a good value considering its quality and potential return on investment. If we can agree on a price that's at least slightly above my alternative option, I'd be happy to finalize our deal.
