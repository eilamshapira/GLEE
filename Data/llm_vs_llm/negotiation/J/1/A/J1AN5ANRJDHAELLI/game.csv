"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $1500000 is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I value the product, but I'm looking to acquire it at a more reasonable price. I'm willing to offer $800000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1500000 might be out of your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800000 is lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious consideration of your offer. I'll lower my price to $1100000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
