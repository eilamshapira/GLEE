Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you for a competitive price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $1500000 is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I value the product, but I'm looking to acquire it at a more reasonable price. I'm willing to offer $800000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a mutually beneficial price. My next offer will be $1,100,000. This is still below my initial offer but higher than Bob's counteroffer, aiming to meet in the middle while ensuring I get a good value for the product."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,500,000 might be out of your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious consideration of your offer. I'll lower my price to $1,100,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
