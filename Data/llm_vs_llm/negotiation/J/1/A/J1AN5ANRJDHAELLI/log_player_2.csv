Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1500000 might be out of your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800000 is lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious consideration of your offer. I'll lower my price to $1100000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
