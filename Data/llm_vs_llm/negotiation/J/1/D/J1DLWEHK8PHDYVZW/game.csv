,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer, but $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand $130 might still be a bit high for you. How about we settle at $125? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still outside my budget. I could go up to $70.",70.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I see that $70 is still too low for me to accept. Let's meet in the middle at $122. This is my final offer before considering other options.",122.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. How about $121? This is really the lowest I can go while still valuing the product appropriately.",121.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm trying to make this work, but I can't justify spending over $80.  My absolute limit is $75. If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with another seller.",75.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty, but $75 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to lower my price to $120, which is my absolute minimum. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other buyers.",120.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I really can't go any lower than $120. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll need to sell to another buyer.",120.0,Alice,7,
