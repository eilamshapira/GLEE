"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer of $800,000 is my floor. Selling to John is the same outcome. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I need to keep some room for negotiation, but come down from my initial price.
