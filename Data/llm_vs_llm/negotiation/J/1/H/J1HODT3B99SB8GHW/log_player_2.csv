"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is equal to my maximum budget, there's a chance I could get the product for a lower price. It makes sense to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to come down at all."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer (approximately 1/3 lower than Alice's initial offer) allows room for negotiation while still being a potentially attractive price for Alice if she's motivated to sell."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but slowly. I'll counter with a price closer to her offer to signal I'm willing to pay more, but still, aim for a lower final price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and the price difference now is only $50,000 less than John's offer. It's unlikely Alice will drop her price much further, and I risk losing out on a decent deal by continuing to negotiate."
