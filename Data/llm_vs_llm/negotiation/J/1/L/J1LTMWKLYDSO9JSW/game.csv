"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While the product sounds interesting, $10000 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider $5000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $5000 is significantly lower than what I need to let go of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $7500? This is a fair price considering the value it holds.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks Alice, I appreciate you coming down. $7500 is closer to what I was thinking. Would you consider $6500? I'm ready to close the deal if we can agree on that price.",6500.0,Bob,4,
