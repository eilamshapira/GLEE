"Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Considering its exceptional qualities, I'm prepared to offer it to you for the price of $1600000.

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of a significantly lower price point. Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to propose a more modest investment.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600000 is not feasible for me. The intrinsic value of this product is considerably higher. I am willing to lower the price. However, to move forward, I have to propose a new price: $1500000",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price, but $1500000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer, but I need to stay within a reasonable range. I propose we meet closer to the middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear your budget concerns, but I can't go that low. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to further reduce the price to $1400000. This represents a considerable concession on my part.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the continued reductions in price, and I'm glad we're moving closer to a mutually agreeable figure. However, $1400000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer again, but I need to stay within my budget constraints.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm sensing we are far apart. I have reduced the price considerably, but I can't go below a certain point. This is my final offer: $1300000. Take it or leave it.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid $1300000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be realistic about my financial constraints. If we can't meet in the middle, I may need to explore other options.",775000.0,Bob,8,
