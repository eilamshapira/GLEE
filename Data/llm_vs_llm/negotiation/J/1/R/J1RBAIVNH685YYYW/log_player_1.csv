"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Considering its exceptional qualities, I'm prepared to offer it to you for the price of $1,600,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of a significantly lower price point. Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to propose a more modest investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is not feasible for me. The intrinsic value of this product is considerably higher.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price, but $1500000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer, but I need to stay within a reasonable range. I propose we meet closer to the middle ground.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I hear your budget concerns, but I can't go that low. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to further reduce the price to $1,400,000. This represents a considerable concession on my part."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the continued reductions in price, and I'm glad we're moving closer to a mutually agreeable figure. However, $1400000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer again, but I need to stay within my budget constraints.

At this point, I'm starting to consider John's offer seriously. However, I still have rounds left, and it's possible Bob might budge a bit more. I'll reject his offer and make a final counteroffer.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we are far apart. I have reduced the price considerably, but I can't go below a certain point. This is my final offer: $1,300,000. Take it or leave it."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid $1300000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be realistic about my financial constraints. If we can't meet in the middle, I may need to explore other options.
