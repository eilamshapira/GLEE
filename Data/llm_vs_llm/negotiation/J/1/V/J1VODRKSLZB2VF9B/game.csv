"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to counter with $1000000. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1000000 is a serious offer, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000, considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $1100000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a better deal. How about we settle at $1050000? I think this could be a fair compromise for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I can see we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. While $1050000 is a good offer, I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $1075000. This is the lowest I'm comfortable going at this point, considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
