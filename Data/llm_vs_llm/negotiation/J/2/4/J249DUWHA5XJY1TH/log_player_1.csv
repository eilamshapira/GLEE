Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price for a product of this caliber."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit higher than what I was hoping to spend. How about $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still too low considering the product's value to Bob. I'll try to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is lower than what I can accept for this product. Given its quality and value, I can come down to $10,000, which I believe is a fair price that would benefit both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay Alice, I understand. How about we meet in the middle at $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $9,500. This is a reasonable compromise that's significantly better than John's $8,000 offer, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. The price of $9,500 gives me a good profit margin above my minimum of $8,000."
