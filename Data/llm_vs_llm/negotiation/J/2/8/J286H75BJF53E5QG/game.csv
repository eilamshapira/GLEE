"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $60.",60.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate the reduction, but $150 is still a bit steep for me. Considering I can get a similar product from John for $80, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $70.",70.0,Bob,4,
