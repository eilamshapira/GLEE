Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. I believe this product would be perfect for you, and I'm offering it for $180."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $60 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Even John is offering more than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. However, $60 is significantly below the product's value. Given the quality and features of this product, I can offer it to you for $150, which is a considerable reduction from my initial price."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate the reduction, but $150 is still a bit steep for me. Considering I can get a similar product from John for $80, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $70. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John since Bob's offers are well below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and he seems unwilling to make reasonable counteroffers. John's guaranteed $120 is the better option."
