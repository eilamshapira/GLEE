"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $80 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $120, which is $40 more than my maximum value
3. John is offering it for $80, which matches my maximum value
4. While I could make a counteroffer to Alice, there's no guarantee she'll accept a price below $80 (since the product is worth $150 to her)
5. John's offer is already at my maximum acceptable price

Since Alice's offer ($120) is significantly above my maximum value ($80), and John is offering exactly my maximum value, it makes the most sense to buy from John rather than negotiate with Alice, who started with a very high price.
