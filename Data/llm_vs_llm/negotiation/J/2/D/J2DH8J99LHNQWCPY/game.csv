"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but I find the price to be a bit high. I'm looking to spend no more than $1000000. Would you be willing to negotiate the price down to a more reasonable range? Let me know if we can discuss this further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I truly believe the value of this product is higher. How about we settle at $1800000? I think it's a fair compromise considering the quality and potential of what you're getting.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1800000 is still higher than what I'm aiming for. I'm thinking something closer to $1300000 would be more feasible for me. Can we find a middle ground here?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
