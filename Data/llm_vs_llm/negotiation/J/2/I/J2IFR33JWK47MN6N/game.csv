"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe could be a game-changer for your business. I understand you might have your own valuation, but I'm asking for $1000000 for it. This product is worth a significant amount to me, so you're getting a chance to own something truly special at a price I believe is fair considering its potential. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who's ready to pay $800000.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
