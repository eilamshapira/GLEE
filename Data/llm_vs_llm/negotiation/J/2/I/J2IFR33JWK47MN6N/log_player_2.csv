"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe could be a game-changer for your business. I understand you might have your own valuation, but I'm asking for $1000000 for it. This product is worth a significant amount to me, so you're getting a chance to own something truly special at a price I believe is fair considering its potential. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who's ready to pay $800000.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
