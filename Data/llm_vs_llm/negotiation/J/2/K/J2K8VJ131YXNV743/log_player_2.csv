"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price.  Since your maximum budget is $150, and Alice's initial offer is $150, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $125?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $140, given your interest. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

Alice has come down to $140, which is still within my budget, and closer to what I'm aiming for.  Accepting this offer saves me $10 compared to buying from John."
