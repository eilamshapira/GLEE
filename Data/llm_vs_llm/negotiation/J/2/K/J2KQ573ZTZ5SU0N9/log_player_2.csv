Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer is $9,200, which is closer to Bob's desired price point of $8,500. While Bob could continue negotiating, it's likely Alice won't go much lower. Accepting the offer saves Bob $800 compared to buying from John."
