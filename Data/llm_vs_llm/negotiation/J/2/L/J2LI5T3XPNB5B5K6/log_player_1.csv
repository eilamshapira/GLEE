"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm coming down from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my value.  $1,000,000 is a good compromise that still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer, it's still too low. I'm not willing to settle for that price yet. I'll try to get a higher price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's last offer. This shows flexibility while keeping in mind my own minimum value."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not where I want it to be.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

I'm making a final attempt to meet somewhere in the middle with Bob.  This offer is still a fair amount higher than his last offer but significantly lower than my starting point."
