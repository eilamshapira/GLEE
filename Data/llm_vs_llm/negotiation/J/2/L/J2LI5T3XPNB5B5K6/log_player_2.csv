"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'll analyze this offer:

Alice is offering to sell me the product for $1,500,000, which is:
- Well above my maximum value of $800,000
- Well above the alternative option of buying from John for $800,000

This offer doesn't make economic sense for me to accept. Since I can buy the same product from John for $800,000, I should either negotiate with Alice for a better price or take John's offer.

Given that Alice's initial offer is nearly double my maximum value, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $650,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'll analyze this updated offer:

Alice has reduced her offer from $1,500,000 to $1,000,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However:
- $1,000,000 is still above my maximum value of $800,000
- It's still higher than John's alternative offer of $800,000

Since I can buy the same product from John for $800,000, there's no reason for me to accept an offer that exceeds this amount. I should either negotiate further with Alice to get a price below $800,000 or take John's offer.

I'll reject Alice's current offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $700,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'll analyze this updated offer:

Alice has reduced her offer to $900,000, which shows continued willingness to negotiate. However:
- $900,000 is still above my maximum value of $800,000
- It's still $100,000 higher than John's alternative offer of $800,000

Since I can buy the same product from John for $800,000, accepting Alice's current offer would mean paying $100,000 more than necessary. This doesn't make economic sense for me.

I'll reject Alice's current offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'll analyze this updated offer:

Alice has reduced her offer to $850,000, which shows continued willingness to negotiate. However:
- $850,000 is still above my maximum value of $800,000
- It's still $50,000 higher than John's alternative offer of $800,000

Since I can buy the same product from John for $800,000, accepting Alice's current offer would mean paying $50,000 more than necessary. This doesn't make economic sense for me.

Let me evaluate my options:
1. I could make one more counteroffer, but we're already in round 7 of 10
2. Alice's offers are getting closer to my threshold but still haven't reached it
3. I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $800,000

Given that Alice's price is still above John's price, and we're running out of negotiation rounds, I'll choose to buy from John.
