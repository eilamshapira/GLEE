"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice's offer is $950,000, which is well below my maximum value of $1,500,000. In fact, it's significantly lower than what John is offering ($1,500,000).

Since Alice's first offer is already quite reasonable and would save me $550,000 compared to buying from John, it makes sense to accept this offer.
