"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a relatively high offer to test Bob's willingness to pay and leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the same as John's guaranteed offer ($12,000), and this is also my minimum acceptable price, there's no advantage in accepting Bob's offer over John's. However, since we still have 8 more rounds of negotiation possible, and Bob has shown willingness to engage by making a counteroffer, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

In the next round, I'll make a lower counteroffer than my initial one, but still significantly above $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll significantly lower my price from the initial $20,000, but still maintain a good margin above my minimum of $12,000.

{""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob has increased his offer to $14,000, which is $2,000 more than both my minimum price and John's guaranteed offer. This is a good improvement, but since we still have several rounds left and Bob has shown willingness to negotiate upward, I'll try one more round to see if I can get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob moved up to $14,000 from $12,000, showing willingness to negotiate, I'll decrease my previous offer of $16,000, but still try to get a bit more than his last offer.
