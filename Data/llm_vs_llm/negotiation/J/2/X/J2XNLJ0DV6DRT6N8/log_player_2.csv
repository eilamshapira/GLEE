"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer because $200 is actually higher than my maximum value of $150, and it's also higher than John's price of $150. Since I can get it from John for $150, there's no reason to accept a price above that. I'll make a counteroffer to see if Alice will consider a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 100}

I'll offer $100. This gives some room for negotiation while being significantly below John's price of $150. If Alice rejects this, we can potentially meet somewhere in the middle, but I won't go above $150 since that's both my maximum value and John's asking price."
