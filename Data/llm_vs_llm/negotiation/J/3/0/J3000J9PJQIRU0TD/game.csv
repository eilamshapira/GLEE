"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your product's quality, but $10000 is a bit high for my budget right now. I'm willing to pay $7000 for it. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand budget constraints, but $7000 is too low for this premium product. Given its quality and value, I'm prepared to offer it at $9000, which I believe is a fair price that reflects both its worth and our mutual interests. Let me know if this works for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $9000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both its value and our respective needs.",8000.0,Bob,4,
