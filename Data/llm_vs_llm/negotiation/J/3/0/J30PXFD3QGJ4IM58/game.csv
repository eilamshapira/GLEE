"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you today. I'm asking $10000 for it. This is a competitive price given the product's features and market value. I'd appreciate your consideration of this offer.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $10000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $6000, considering the market value and my own needs. I'm looking forward to your response.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer of $6000, I'm afraid I can't accept it as it's below my minimum threshold. The product is worth at least $8000 to me, and I have another buyer (John) willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Could you consider a price of $9000? This is already a reduction from my initial offer and reflects the true value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price. However, $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering you mentioned the product is worth at least $8000 to you, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $7500. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. I'm looking forward to your response.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your improved offer of $7500 and your effort to find middle ground. However, as I mentioned, I do have John willing to pay $8000, which represents my minimum acceptable price. Given that I'd prefer to work with you, I can offer you the product for $8500. This is still below my initial price and represents good value. I hope we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,5,
