Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you today. I'm asking $10,000 for it. This is a competitive price given the product's features and market value. I'd appreciate your consideration of this offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $10000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $6000, considering the market value and my own needs. I'm looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer of $6,000, I'm afraid I can't accept it as it's below my minimum threshold. The product is worth at least $8,000 to me, and I have another buyer (John) willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Could you consider a price of $9,000? This is already a reduction from my initial offer and reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price. However, $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering you mentioned the product is worth at least $8000 to you, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $7500. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. I'm looking forward to your response.

However, as I mentioned, I do have John willing to pay $8,000, which represents my minimum acceptable price. Given that I'd prefer to work with you, I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is still below my initial price and represents good value. I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
