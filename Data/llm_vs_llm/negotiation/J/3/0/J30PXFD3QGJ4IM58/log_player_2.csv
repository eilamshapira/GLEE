Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you today. I'm asking $10000 for it. This is a competitive price given the product's features and market value. I'd appreciate your consideration of this offer.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $6,000, considering the market value and my own needs. I'm looking forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer of $6000, I'm afraid I can't accept it as it's below my minimum threshold. The product is worth at least $8000 to me, and I have another buyer (John) willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Could you consider a price of $9000? This is already a reduction from my initial offer and reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering you mentioned the product is worth at least $8,000 to you, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $7,500. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. I'm looking forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your improved offer of $7500 and your effort to find middle ground. However, as I mentioned, I do have John willing to pay $8000, which represents my minimum acceptable price. Given that I'd prefer to work with you, I can offer you the product for $8500. This is still below my initial price and represents good value. I hope we can come to an agreement.
