"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer against my alternatives. 

Alice is offering the product for $10,000, which exceeds the maximum value of $8,000 that the product is worth to me. I can buy the same product from John for $8,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer when I can get the same product for $2,000 less from John. While I could try to negotiate with Alice, I already have a guaranteed option that meets my maximum valuation.
