Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,000,000, I will reject her offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll offer a price that is close to my maximum budget.
