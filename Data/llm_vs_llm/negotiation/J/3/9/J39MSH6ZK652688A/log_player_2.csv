"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $15,000
2. John's fixed price is $15,000
3. Alice is offering $12,000, which is $3,000 less than my maximum value and John's price
4. While I could try to negotiate for an even lower price, $12,000 is already a good deal with $3,000 in savings

Since Alice's offer is already significantly below my maximum value and John's price, it would be wise to accept this offer. There's a risk that if I reject and try to negotiate lower, Alice might increase the price in subsequent rounds.
