"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $100 is at the top of my budget. I can find this product elsewhere for less. I'd be willing to pay $70 for it. What do you think?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $70 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop my price to $85.  Let me know if that works for you.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. I could go up to $75, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. That would work well with my budget. Does that work for you?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  While I'm getting closer to where I need to be, $75 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $80.  It's a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close this deal.",80.0,Alice,5,
