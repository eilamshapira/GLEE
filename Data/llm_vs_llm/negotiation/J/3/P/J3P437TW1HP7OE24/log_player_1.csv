"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $100 is at the top of my budget. I can find this product elsewhere for less. I'd be willing to pay $70 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $70 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell for that low yet. I'll see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $70 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop my price to $85.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. I could go up to $75, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. That would work well with my budget. Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $75 is getting closer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  While I'm getting closer to where I need to be, $75 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $80.  It's a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 80}
