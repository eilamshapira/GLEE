"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","The offer from Alice is $1,600,000, which exceeds the maximum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me. It also exceeds the price of $800,000 that John is willing to sell it for. There's no reason to accept this offer or continue negotiating when I have a better alternative.
