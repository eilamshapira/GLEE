Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on an appropriate price to offer Bob. The product is worth $15,000 to Bob and $10,000 to me. If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell to John for $10,000, so I don't want to go below that price.

Since Bob values the product at $15,000, he would be willing to pay up to that amount. However, if I price it too close to $15,000, Bob might reject the offer since he wouldn't gain much value from the transaction.

A reasonable approach would be to split the surplus value between us. The surplus is $5,000 ($15,000 - $10,000), so a fair split would be offering the product at $12,500, which gives both of us a $2,500 benefit compared to our alternatives.
