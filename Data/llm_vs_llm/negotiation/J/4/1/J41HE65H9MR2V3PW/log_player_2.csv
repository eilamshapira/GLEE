"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I'm offering this exclusive product for $20000. Please let me know if you're interested or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $20,000, which is $5,000 more than my maximum value
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $15,000
4. Even if I make a counteroffer, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a price below $15,000

The logical choice is to buy from John rather than accept Alice's high offer or enter a potentially lengthy negotiation that might not result in a better price.
