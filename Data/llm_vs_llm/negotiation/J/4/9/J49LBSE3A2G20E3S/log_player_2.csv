"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","The offer of $3,000,000 from Alice is significantly higher than the value of the product to me (which is no more than $800,000), and it's also much higher than John's alternative offer of $800,000. There's no reason for me to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that is well below Alice's initial high price but still gives room for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer of $2,500,000 is still significantly higher than the maximum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me, and it's also much higher than John's alternative offer of $800,000. There's no benefit in accepting this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has only reduced her offer by $500,000 from her initial price, I'll increase my offer slightly but still keep it well below the $800,000 maximum I'm willing to pay.

{""product_price"": $600,000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is still well above the maximum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me, and it remains much higher than John's guaranteed offer. Alice seems to be making incremental reductions but starting from an extremely high price point.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice continues to make large decreases in her price ($500,000 each time), which suggests she has significant room to negotiate. However, her offers are still far above my maximum. I'll continue to gradually increase my offer while keeping it below my alternative from John.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer of $1,750,000 is still more than double my maximum value of $800,000 for the product. While Alice is now making smaller reductions in her price, her offer remains significantly higher than John's alternative of $800,000. There's no reason to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice seems to be slowing down her price reductions, which suggests we may not reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. Since we only have a few rounds left and I have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000, I'll make my final best offer to Alice, which is just below John's price.

{""product_price"": $790,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still twice the amount of my maximum value and John's guaranteed price of $800,000. We only have one round left after this, and it seems unlikely that Alice will drop her price below $800,000 in the final round, given the pattern of her decreases so far.

At this point, the most rational decision is to go with the guaranteed option from John.
