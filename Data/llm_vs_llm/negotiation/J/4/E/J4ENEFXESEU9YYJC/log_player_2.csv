"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $150 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). It would be irrational to accept this offer when I can either negotiate for a better price or buy from John at $80. I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 65}

I'll offer $65, which is below both my maximum value and John's price of $80. This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to save money compared to buying from John. Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, this offer might be low enough to show I'm serious about negotiating but not so low as to be insulting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer ($100) is still higher than John's price ($80), and Alice seems resistant to go below $100 after rejecting my $65 offer, it makes the most economic sense to buy from John. John's price of $80 is equal to my maximum value and is guaranteed, while continuing to negotiate with Alice might not lead to a better deal and would take more time and effort."
