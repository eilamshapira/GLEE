"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product! Considering its value and quality, I'm offering it to you for $170.",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $170 is too high for me. I know I can get this product from John for $120, which is the actual market value of the product. I'd like to buy from you instead, but I can only offer $100 for it. This would save you the trouble of finding another buyer and give me a small discount compared to John's price.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is too low. I value this product at more than that. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $135.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice, but $135 is still more than I'd pay, especially when John is offering the same product for $120. I value our potential business relationship, so I'm willing to offer $110. This gives you a better deal than having to find another buyer, and gives me a small savings compared to John's price.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit more. Considering the quality of the product and your potential long-term value as a customer, I'm willing to meet you at $125. This is my final offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I can still get this exact product from John for $120. I value doing business with you, but I can't pay more than the market price. My final offer is $120, which matches John's price. This way we both benefit - you make a sale at the product's market value, and I build a relationship with you as a seller.",120.0,Bob,6,
