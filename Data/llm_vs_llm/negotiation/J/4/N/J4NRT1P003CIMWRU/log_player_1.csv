"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product! Considering its value and quality, I'm offering it to you for $170."", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $170 is too high for me. I know I can get this product from John for $120, which is the actual market value of the product. I'd like to buy from you instead, but I can only offer $100 for it. This would save you the trouble of finding another buyer and give me a small discount compared to John's price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, I need to decide if I accept Bob's offer of $100, reject it and counteroffer, or sell to John for $120.

Given that the product is worth $120 to me, I will reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round. Selling to John is still an option if Bob's offers are too low.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is too low. I value this product at more than that. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $135."", ""product_price"": 135}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice, but $135 is still more than I'd pay, especially when John is offering the same product for $120. I value our potential business relationship, so I'm willing to offer $110. This gives you a better deal than having to find another buyer, and gives me a small savings compared to John's price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","This is a tricky situation. Bob is offering $110, which is still less than the $120 I could get from John. However, it's more than my minimum of $120. I'm also starting to get concerned about wasting time on this negotiation.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make one more counteroffer, hoping to close the deal quickly. If he rejects again, I'll sell to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit more. Considering the quality of the product and your potential long-term value as a customer, I'm willing to meet you at $125. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I can still get this exact product from John for $120. I value doing business with you, but I can't pay more than the market price. My final offer is $120, which matches John's price. This way we both benefit - you make a sale at the product's market value, and I build a relationship with you as a seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","This is the perfect scenario for me. Bob is offering $120, which is exactly the amount I can get from John. I should accept this offer.
