"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product! Considering its value and quality, I'm offering it to you for $170. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's offer of $170 is higher than the value of the product to me (which is at most $120). It also exceeds John's guaranteed price of $120. There's no reason to accept this high offer when I have a better alternative.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $170 is too high for me. I know I can get this product from John for $120, which is the actual market value of the product. I'd like to buy from you instead, but I can only offer $100 for it. This would save you the trouble of finding another buyer and give me a small discount compared to John's price."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is too low. I value this product at more than that. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $135. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $135 is still higher than John's price of $120. Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and I can buy it from John for exactly $120, I should reject Alice's offer and counter with a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice, but $135 is still more than I'd pay, especially when John is offering the same product for $120. I value our potential business relationship, so I'm willing to offer $110. This gives you a better deal than having to find another buyer, and gives me a small savings compared to John's price."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit more. Considering the quality of the product and your potential long-term value as a customer, I'm willing to meet you at $125. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $125 is still higher than John's price of $120. Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and I can buy it from John for exactly $120, I should reject this offer. Alice says this is her ""final offer,"" but I should try once more with a counteroffer at or below $120 before going to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I can still get this exact product from John for $120. I value doing business with you, but I can't pay more than the market price. My final offer is $120, which matches John's price. This way we both benefit - you make a sale at the product's market value, and I build a relationship with you as a seller."", ""product_price"": 120}"
