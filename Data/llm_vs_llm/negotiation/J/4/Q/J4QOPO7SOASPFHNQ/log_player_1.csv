"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I must point out that $1200000 is significantly above market value. I've done my research, and I know I can get this product elsewhere for $1000000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $850000? This would be a fair price that allows you to make a reasonable profit while giving me a better deal than my alternative options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
