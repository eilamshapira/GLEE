"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I am excited to offer you this exclusive product. I believe it will bring immense value to you. I'm willing to sell it for $1200000, considering its unique features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,200,000 is above my maximum value of $1,000,000, and it's also higher than John's price. I'll reject and make a counteroffer to Alice, knowing I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I must point out that $1,200,000 is significantly above market value. I've done my research, and I know I can get this product elsewhere for $1,000,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $850,000? This would be a fair price that allows you to make a reasonable profit while giving me a better deal than my alternative options."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
