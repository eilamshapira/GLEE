"Bob, I'm offering you this unique opportunity to acquire this incredibly valuable product. Given its immense worth to you and the market, I'm confident it will be a fantastic investment. My initial asking price is $1450000.",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think it's quite high considering market conditions. Your price is very close to what I can get elsewhere. I value our potential business relationship and would like to make a fair offer that would be profitable for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1150000, which would give you a healthy profit margin while being more reasonable for me.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and I appreciate you valuing our potential relationship. However, $1150000 is lower than I'm comfortable with. Given the true value of this product, and knowing it's worth $1500000 to you, I can come down a little bit. How about $1375000?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1375000 is still quite high considering the market. I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to increase my previous offer. I can offer $1225000, which would still give you a substantial profit while being more reasonable for me. This is a significant increase from my last offer, showing I'm serious about reaching a deal.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I acknowledge the increase and your seriousness. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. Let's try $1325000. This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it reflects the true value to you.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility in this negotiation. You've shown good faith by reducing your price, and I want to respond in kind. I can increase my offer to $1275000. This represents a significant move up from my last offer and would provide you with a very healthy profit margin while still giving me some value in the deal. I believe this is a fair price that works well for both of us.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I can see you're serious about this. Knowing the value to you, I can come down to $1300000. This is my final significant offer; I'm not willing to go any lower. This price represents a very fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
