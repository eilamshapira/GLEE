{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and within my budget. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a lower price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $100. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand budgets can be tight, and while $150 might be a stretch, considering the quality of the product, I'm prepared to lower my price. How about we meet halfway at $130? Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $130 is still above my maximum budget of $120. While it's a better offer than the initial $150, I'm not willing to pay more than $120. I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice was willing to lower the price to $130, I'll try to meet her halfway between her new offer and my previous counteroffer of $100. This would put the price at $115, which is still within my budget of $120.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and lowering the price to $130. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Would you be willing to sell the product to me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 115}"
