"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $12,000 is a decent price, there's a chance Alice might be willing to go even lower. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much wiggle room there is. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still potentially staying well below Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice moved down from her initial offer, which is a good sign. It suggests my target price is achievable. I'll counteroffer closer to her price, but still below $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 9250
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm inching closer to her price but staying firm below the $10,000 psychological barrier. This keeps the pressure on Alice to justify any price above that mark."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to my desired range. However, with several rounds left, it's worth seeing if she'll budge a bit more. I'm willing to push slightly further, but I need to be mindful of the diminishing returns and the alternative offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 9600
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between her last offer and my previous one. It signals that I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a firm limit on how much I'm willing to concede."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  $9,800 is a very good price, and Alice is unlikely to go much lower. It's a significant saving compared to John's offer, and further haggling carries the risk of losing the deal altogether."
