Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob.

Since the product is worth at least $100 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, I need to offer Bob a price that has potential to earn me more than $100.

I don't know how much the product is worth to Bob, but I want to maximize my earnings while still giving Bob a reasonable chance to accept. I'll set the price at $150, which gives me a 50% premium over my minimum acceptable value.
