Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my offer to Bob. 

The product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that exact price. Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I should set a price that's reasonably higher than my minimum acceptable amount.

If I set the price too high, Bob might reject it, but that's fine because I can still sell to John for $1,200,000. If I set it too close to my minimum, I might miss out on potential profit.

A reasonable approach would be to set a price that gives me a good margin above my minimum while still being potentially attractive to Bob.
