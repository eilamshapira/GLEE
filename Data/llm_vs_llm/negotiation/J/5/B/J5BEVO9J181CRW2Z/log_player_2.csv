"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer is $1,650,000, which is higher than both my maximum valuation ($1,500,000) and John's price ($1,500,000), I should not accept Alice's offer.

The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, so paying $1,650,000 would be a loss.

John is offering the product at exactly $1,500,000, which matches my maximum valuation.
