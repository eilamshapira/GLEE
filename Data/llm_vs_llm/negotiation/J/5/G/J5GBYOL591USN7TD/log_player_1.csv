"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I'm currently offering for sale. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you at $1,500,000. This is a competitive price for this product, and I believe it would be a valuable addition to your portfolio. I do have other interested parties, including another buyer who has already made a solid offer, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the opportunity. However, given my budget constraints and the need to stay within a reasonable range for this acquisition, I am willing to offer $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the current market conditions. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to make a decision based on the economic considerations here.

Bob's offer of $900,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000, which is the amount John is willing to pay. Even if I continue negotiating with Bob, I'm not certain he would ever exceed my minimum threshold since his maximum value for the product is $1,000,000.

The most rational decision is to take the guaranteed offer from John.
