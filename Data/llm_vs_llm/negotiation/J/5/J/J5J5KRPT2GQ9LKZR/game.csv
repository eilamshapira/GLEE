"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $18000 is significantly more than what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth about $15000 to me, which happens to be the same price another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. I'm willing to offer $12500 for the product. This gives you a reasonable profit while also giving me some savings compared to my alternative option.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12500 is quite below what I can accept. Considering your valuation and our mutual interest in a deal, I'm willing to offer the product to you for $16500. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. However, $16500 is still more than what I can justify paying. As I mentioned, I have an alternative option to purchase the same product from John for $15000, which is exactly what the product is worth to me. To make it worthwhile to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I'm willing to offer $14000, which would save me $1000 compared to my alternative while still giving you a reasonable profit. This seems like a fair middle ground that benefits us both.",14000.0,Bob,4,
