Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $18000 is significantly more than what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth about $15000 to me, which happens to be the same price another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. I'm willing to offer $12500 for the product. This gives you a reasonable profit while also giving me some savings compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is quite below what I can accept. Considering your valuation and our mutual interest in a deal, I'm willing to offer the product to you for $16,500. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 16500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. However, $16500 is still more than what I can justify paying. As I mentioned, I have an alternative option to purchase the same product from John for $15000, which is exactly what the product is worth to me. To make it worthwhile to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I'm willing to offer $14000, which would save me $1000 compared to my alternative while still giving you a reasonable profit. This seems like a fair middle ground that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
