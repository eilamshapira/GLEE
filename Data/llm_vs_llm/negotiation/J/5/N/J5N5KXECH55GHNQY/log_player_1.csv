Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a price that maximizes my earnings while considering that Bob might reject if the price is too high.

Since the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at exactly that price, there's no reason to offer Bob anything below $1,500,000.

I should offer Bob a price higher than $1,500,000, but not so high that he's very likely to reject it. Without knowing Bob's valuation, I'll need to set a reasonable markup that gives me additional profit if accepted while not risking losing the sale completely (since I have John as a backup).
