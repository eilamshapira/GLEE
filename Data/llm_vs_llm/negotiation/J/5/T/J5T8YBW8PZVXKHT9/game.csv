"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. The product looks interesting, but $110 is beyond what I'm willing to pay. I can get the same product from another seller for $80. However, I'd like to buy from you if the price is right. I'm willing to offer $70 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $70 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $90?  It's still a great deal for you and a fair price for me.",90.0,Alice,3,
