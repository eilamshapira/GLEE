"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. The product looks interesting, but $110 is beyond what I'm willing to pay. I can get the same product from another seller for $80. However, I'd like to buy from you if the price is right. I'm willing to offer $70 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $70 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $90?  It's still a great deal for you and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 90}
