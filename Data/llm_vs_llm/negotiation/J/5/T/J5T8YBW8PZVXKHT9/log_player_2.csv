"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is asking for $110, which is more than the $80 maximum I value the product at. Since I know I can buy the same product from John for $80, there's no reason for me to pay Alice's higher price of $110.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. The product looks interesting, but $110 is beyond what I'm willing to pay. I can get the same product from another seller for $80. However, I'd like to buy from you if the price is right. I'm willing to offer $70 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $70 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $90?  It's still a great deal for you and a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has countered with $90, which is still higher than John's price of $80. Since I'm looking to buy the product but save as much money as possible, and the product is only worth $80 to me at maximum, I should not accept Alice's offer of $90.
