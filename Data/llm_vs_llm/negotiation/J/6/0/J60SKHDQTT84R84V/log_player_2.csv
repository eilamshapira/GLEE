"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given that Alice is offering the product for $130, which is more than the $120 it's worth to me, and also more than John's fixed price of $120, the rational decision would be to either negotiate with Alice or simply buy from John.

Since John is offering the product at exactly what it's worth to me ($120), and Alice's initial offer is higher, I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $100}"

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has reduced her price to $125, but that's still more than John's price of $120. Since I can buy the product from John for $120, which is exactly what the product is worth to me, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $125.
