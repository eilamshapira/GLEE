"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Looking at the offer from Alice, she's asking for $1,500,000 for the product. Since the product is only worth up to $800,000 to me, and John is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $800,000, Alice's offer doesn't make financial sense for me.

I should buy from John to save $700,000.
