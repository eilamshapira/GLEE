Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the information about your high-quality product. However, I must inform you that the price you're asking is well above my budget and valuation. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me a similar product for exactly that price. I'm interested in your product, but I would need a much more competitive offer. I'm willing to pay $750000 for your product, which would save me from having to go with John's offer while giving you a quick sale. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand you have budget constraints, but I need to clarify that my product offers superior quality and features compared to alternatives on the market. While I appreciate your offer of $750,000, that's significantly below the product's true value and my minimum acceptable price. John has actually offered me $1,500,000 for this product, which reflects its market value more accurately. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $1,950,000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial offer. This price better reflects the product's quality and potential return on investment."", ""product_price"": 1950000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce your initial offer, but I need to be clear about my situation. While you mention superior quality and features, the product is still worth no more than $1000000 to me based on my needs and valuation. You mentioned John offered you $1500000, which is interesting since John is actually offering to sell me the product for $1000000. I'm still interested in working with you instead, but my maximum budget remains firm. I can increase my offer to $850000, which would be a fair deal considering my alternatives. I hope we can find common ground, but I'm prepared to go with John's offer if necessary. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but there seems to be some confusion. John has indeed offered to buy my product for $1,500,000, not sell a similar product. This is my guaranteed alternative if our negotiation doesn't work out. I understand you value the product at $1,000,000, and while I can't go as low as $850,000, I can meet you partway. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,600,000, which is significantly below my initial price and closer to your valuation. This represents a good compromise that acknowledges both your budget constraints and the true market value of my product."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the clarification. I understand your position, but I need to be transparent about mine as well. While John may have offered to buy your product for $1500000, I know for certain that John is willing to sell me a comparable product for $1000000. That's my guaranteed alternative in this negotiation. Given this reality, I cannot justify paying $1600000 for your product when it's worth no more than $1000000 to me and I have a ready alternative at that price. I can increase my offer to $950000, which is nearly my maximum valuation. This would give you a quick, guaranteed sale rather than potentially extending negotiations with John or others. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to proceed with John's offer.
