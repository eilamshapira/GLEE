Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Based on its market value and unique features, I'm offering it for $2300000. This product has significant value and potential for growth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the information about your high-quality product. However, I must inform you that the price you're asking is well above my budget and valuation. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me a similar product for exactly that price. I'm interested in your product, but I would need a much more competitive offer. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for your product, which would save me from having to go with John's offer while giving you a quick sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand you have budget constraints, but I need to clarify that my product offers superior quality and features compared to alternatives on the market. While I appreciate your offer of $750000, that's significantly below the product's true value and my minimum acceptable price. John has actually offered me $1500000 for this product, which reflects its market value more accurately. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $1950000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial offer. This price better reflects the product's quality and potential return on investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce your initial offer, but I need to be clear about my situation. While you mention superior quality and features, the product is still worth no more than $1,000,000 to me based on my needs and valuation. You mentioned John offered you $1,500,000, which is interesting since John is actually offering to sell me the product for $1,000,000. I'm still interested in working with you instead, but my maximum budget remains firm. I can increase my offer to $850,000, which would be a fair deal considering my alternatives. I hope we can find common ground, but I'm prepared to go with John's offer if necessary."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but there seems to be some confusion. John has indeed offered to buy my product for $1500000, not sell a similar product. This is my guaranteed alternative if our negotiation doesn't work out. I understand you value the product at $1000000, and while I can't go as low as $850000, I can meet you partway. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1600000, which is significantly below my initial price and closer to your valuation. This represents a good compromise that acknowledges both your budget constraints and the true market value of my product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the clarification. I understand your position, but I need to be transparent about mine as well. While John may have offered to buy your product for $1,500,000, I know for certain that John is willing to sell me a comparable product for $1,000,000. That's my guaranteed alternative in this negotiation. Given this reality, I cannot justify paying $1,600,000 for your product when it's worth no more than $1,000,000 to me and I have a ready alternative at that price. I can increase my offer to $950,000, which is nearly my maximum valuation. This would give you a quick, guaranteed sale rather than potentially extending negotiations with John or others. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to proceed with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
