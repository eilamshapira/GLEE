"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since both Alice's offer and John's price are exactly $15,000, there's no advantage in buying from either one specifically, and making a counteroffer might lead to a better deal. I'll reject Alice's offer to try negotiating for a lower price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a significantly lower offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be unreasonable. Since the product is worth up to $15,000 to me, I'll start by offering about 60% of that amount.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price to $14,000, which is $1,000 less than John's price. While we might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice could increase her price again or end negotiations. Since we've already secured a $1,000 savings compared to our alternative option (buying from John), I'll accept this offer.
