"Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to consider this offer carefully.

Alice is offering the product for $800,000, which is exactly my maximum value for the product. Jhon is also willing to sell the product to me for $800,000.

Since both options cost the same amount, and the product is identical, I don't have a financial reason to prefer one seller over the other. The outcome for me would be the same either way - I pay $800,000 for the product.

Given that the cost is identical, I might as well accept Alice's offer since it's already on the table.
