"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer of $300 is twice the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($150), I will definitely not accept this offer. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $150, which is within my budget. However, I'm interested in seeing if I can negotiate a better price with Alice, so I'll reject her offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since my maximum budget is $150, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. I'll offer $100, which is about 2/3 of my maximum budget. This gives us room for further negotiation.

{""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $275. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $275
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $275 is still much higher than my maximum budget of $150. While it's a slight decrease from her initial offer of $300, it's not enough to make it an attractive option for me.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and proceed to the next round. I'll make another counteroffer, trying to bring the price closer to my target range.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $275, and my previous counteroffer was $100, I'll try to meet her halfway. However, I'll also keep in mind that my maximum budget is $150, so I won't go too high. I'll offer $125, which is slightly above my initial counteroffer, but still well below Alice's last offer.

{""product_price"": 125}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $250 is still significantly higher than my maximum budget of $150. While she has decreased the price again, it's not enough to make it a viable option for me.

At this point, I'm starting to think that Alice may not be willing to sell the product to me at a price that I'm comfortable with. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $150, which is within my budget, I'm getting closer to taking that option.

However, I'll give Alice one more chance to come down in price. I'll reject her offer again and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $250, and I've already offered $125, I'll try to split the difference between my maximum budget of $150 and Alice's last offer. However, I won't go above my maximum budget. I'll offer $140, which is slightly below my maximum budget, in the hopes that Alice will be willing to meet me at this price.
