"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at a price of $15000. This is a fair market price for this product, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Looking at Alice's offer carefully:

1. Alice is offering the product for $15,000
2. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
3. John is willing to sell me the same product for $8,000

This is an easy decision. Alice's price ($15,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000). There's no reason to accept Alice's offer when I can get the same product from John at a much lower price that matches my valuation.
