"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

1. My maximum value for the product is $15,000
2. Alice is offering the product for $14,500
3. John is offering the product for $15,000
4. My goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible

Alice's offer ($14,500) is $500 less than John's offer ($15,000), so if I want to buy the product while saving money, I should accept Alice's offer.
