"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $110. I know it's worth $120 to you, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth up to $120 for me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $110
3. John's price is $120
4. Alice's price is $10 lower than John's price

Since Alice's offer ($110) is less than both:
- The maximum I'm willing to pay ($120)
- John's price ($120)

It makes economic sense to accept Alice's offer and save $10 compared to buying from John.
