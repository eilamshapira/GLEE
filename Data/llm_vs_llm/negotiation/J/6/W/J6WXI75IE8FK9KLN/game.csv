,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $180 is quite high for me. I can actually get this same product from another seller for $120. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider selling it for $100? This would save me a bit compared to my alternative option, and we could close the deal right away.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is significantly below the value I place on this product. I'm willing to negotiate, however. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I can still get this product from John for $120, and that's really the maximum I'm willing to pay for it. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I'd need a price of $110. This gives you a quick sale and saves me a bit compared to my alternative. Does that work for you?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While I can't go as low as $110, I'm willing to accept $120 to close this deal quickly.  This is my final offer, as it's the same price I can get from John, but I'd rather sell it to you directly.",120.0,Alice,5,
