Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $180 is quite high for me. I can actually get this same product from another seller for $120. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider selling it for $100? This would save me a bit compared to my alternative option, and we could close the deal right away. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I can still get this product from John for $120, and that's really the maximum I'm willing to pay for it. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I'd need a price of $110. This gives you a quick sale and saves me a bit compared to my alternative. Does that work for you?
