"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is offering the product for $180, but it's worth no more than $120 to me, and I can buy it from John for exactly $120.

Since Alice's offer ($180) is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price, there's no reason to accept it.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $180 is quite high for me. I can actually get this same product from another seller for $120. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider selling it for $100? This would save me a bit compared to my alternative option, and we could close the deal right away."", ""product_price"": 100}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is significantly below the value I place on this product. I'm willing to negotiate, however. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer of $140. This is still higher than John's price of $120, and since the product is only worth $120 to me, I shouldn't pay more than that. Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, but it still doesn't make financial sense for me to accept this price when I have a better alternative.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I can still get this product from John for $120, and that's really the maximum I'm willing to pay for it. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I'd need a price of $110. This gives you a quick sale and saves me a bit compared to my alternative. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 110}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While I can't go as low as $110, I'm willing to accept $120 to close this deal quickly.  This is my final offer, as it's the same price I can get from John, but I'd rather sell it to you directly.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has now offered the product at $120, which is exactly the same price that John is offering and the maximum value the product has to me. Since there's no price advantage either way, and we've already established a negotiation relationship, I might as well purchase from Alice.
