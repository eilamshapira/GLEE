Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I believe a more reasonable price for the product would be $7500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer as $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. Since Bob initially showed interest and is willing to negotiate, I'll try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement before considering John's offer.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but I cannot accept $7,500 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I can offer you the product for $8,500, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
