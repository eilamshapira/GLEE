"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer of $150 is way too high, considering the product is only worth $80 to me and I have the option to buy from John for $80. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

I'll offer $70, which is slightly below John's price of $80. This gives some room for negotiation while still being potentially profitable for Alice (since the product is worth $120 to her). If Alice rejects this, we can try to find a middle ground, but I always have the option to go to John if Alice's counteroffer is too high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $130 is still significantly higher than John's price of $80. Since I wouldn't pay more than $80 for the product anyway, there's no reason to accept this offer. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 75}

I'll slightly increase my offer to $75. This is still below John's price of $80, giving me a better deal, while also showing some flexibility in negotiation. It would still allow Alice to make a profit since her cost is $120. However, if Alice doesn't come down to a price at or below $80 soon, I'll need to consider taking John's offer instead of continuing negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($120) is still significantly above my maximum value ($80)
2. Even though Alice has come down in price through negotiations (from $150 to $120), she's still at her own cost price ($120)
3. This suggests she's unlikely to go much lower, let alone below $80
4. John's guaranteed price of $80 exactly matches my maximum value
5. We've already spent several rounds negotiating without reaching an acceptable price

Rather than continue negotiations that may not reach my target price, it makes more sense to take John's offer now."
