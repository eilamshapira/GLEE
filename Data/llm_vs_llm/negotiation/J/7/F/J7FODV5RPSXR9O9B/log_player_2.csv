"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I've got a great product I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for a special price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer is exactly at my maximum budget of $120, and buying from John would cost the same, I see no advantage in rejecting the offer to buy from John. However, I also don't see a reason to immediately reject Alice's offer without trying to negotiate or considering if there might be any differences in the products or services offered by Alice and John that could sway my decision. But given the information provided, the most straightforward decision based on price alone would be to accept Alice's offer since it matches my budget and there's no indication that I could get a better deal from her or that John's product would be preferable.
