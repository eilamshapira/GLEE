"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, so I'm starting the bidding at $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is the maximum amount that the product is worth to me. This is also the same price that John is selling the product for. Since both options would cost me the same amount, and I don't have a reason to prefer one seller over the other, I can accept Alice's offer.
