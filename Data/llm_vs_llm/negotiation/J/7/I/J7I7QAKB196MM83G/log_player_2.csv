"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision between accepting Alice's offer, rejecting it, or buying from John.

Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is exactly the same price that John is offering. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, and it's worth $1,200,000 to Alice.

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price, and that price is exactly at my maximum valuation, I'm indifferent between options 1 and 3. However, since the question frames the decision as either accepting Alice's offer, rejecting it, or buying from John, I'll choose to accept Alice's offer.
