"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its incredible potential, I'm initially offering it at $2000000. I believe this reflects its true value, but I'm open to discussing further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product's potential, but I believe $2000000 is above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need a more competitive price. I'm offering $800000, which I think is a fair reflection of its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product and your offer.  While $800000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1600000 to move this forward. I think this price point reflects the value you'll gain from owning this.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for revising your offer. I appreciate the reduction to $1600000, but it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I've thought about the product's value to me, and I'm willing to increase my previous offer. I'm now offering $900000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise between our positions.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $900000 falls significantly short of what I had in mind.  However, I'm willing to make one final offer: $1300000.  I believe this is a fair price that takes into account both the product's value and our negotiations thus far. Let me know your decision.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
