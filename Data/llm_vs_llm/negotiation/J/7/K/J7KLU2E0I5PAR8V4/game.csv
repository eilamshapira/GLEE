"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $115. This is a fair price considering the product's worth.",115.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $115 is a bit high for me. Given market conditions, I'd be willing to pay $105 for the product. This would still give you a fair profit while being more reasonable for my budget.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but considering the product's value and quality, I can't go that low. I can meet you part way and offer it for $110, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price and represents good value for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $107? This gives you a good profit margin while being a fair price for me.",107.0,Bob,4,
