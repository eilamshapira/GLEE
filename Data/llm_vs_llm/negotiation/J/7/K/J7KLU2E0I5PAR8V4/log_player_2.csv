"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $115. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think about this strategically:
1. The product is worth $100 to Alice
2. Alice is offering it for $115
3. John is selling it for $120
4. I can make a counteroffer

Since Alice's price ($115) is already better than John's ($120), but knowing the product is worth $100 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. I should reject and make a counteroffer in the next round to try getting a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's above Alice's cost but below her asking price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $115 is a bit high for me. Given market conditions, I'd be willing to pay $105 for the product. This would still give you a fair profit while being more reasonable for my budget."", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but considering the product's value and quality, I can't go that low. I can meet you part way and offer it for $110, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price and represents good value for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:
1. Alice has come down from $115 to $110
2. This is a $10 markup from her cost ($100)
3. It's $10 less than John's price ($120)
4. We still have 7 rounds left for negotiation

Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing her price by $5. While $110 is better than John's price, I think there's still room for one more negotiation attempt. I'll reject and try one more counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that splits the difference between her last offer ($110) and my previous offer ($105), showing I'm also willing to be flexible.

{""message"": ""Thank you for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $107? This gives you a good profit margin while being a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 107}"
