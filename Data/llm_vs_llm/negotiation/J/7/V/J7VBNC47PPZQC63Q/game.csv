"Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable and has the potential to revolutionize your operations. I'm initially offering it to you for $2500000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the significant return on investment you'll see.",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the potential of the product, the initial price is significantly higher than what I can justify for my budget. I'm willing to offer $600000, which I believe is a fair starting point considering my financial constraints and the value I see in the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600000 is significantly below its true value and the potential return on investment you'll experience.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2000000. This offer reflects the product's potential while acknowledging your budget considerations.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for adjusting your price, but $2000000 is still beyond my budget. I understand the value of the product, but I need to stay within my financial limits. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000. This is a substantial increase on my part, and I hope it shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's value. To bridge the gap, I'm prepared to offer it for $1600000. This significant reduction reflects my desire to reach a deal, but I need to ensure it reflects the product's worth.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle. However, $1600000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750000, which is a significant stretch for me but reflects my commitment to acquiring this product. I hope we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we are approaching an impasse. I understand your budget constraints, but I also have to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1200000. This is a considerable compromise on my part and reflects my sincere desire to reach a deal. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate the significant reduction you've offered. However, $1200000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $775000, which is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. I hope this can be the basis for a final agreement.",775000.0,Bob,8,
