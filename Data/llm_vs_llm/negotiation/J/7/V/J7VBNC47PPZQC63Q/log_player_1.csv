Round 2
Bob's offer:

It's clear that Bob is unwilling to meet me at a price point that reflects the value of the product.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll dramatically increase his offer in the next two rounds. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is the best option to ensure I receive a fair price."
