Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($8,000) but lower than the price I initially offered ($14,000), I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be $13,000.

So, the decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} and I'll send a new offer to Bob.
