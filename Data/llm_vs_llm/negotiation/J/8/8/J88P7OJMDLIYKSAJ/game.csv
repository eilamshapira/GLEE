"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $100 is a little high for me.  Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $70 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $85? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a reasonable price for my product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. I could go up to $75.  Would that work for you?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $75 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $80?  This is my final offer, as I have another buyer who is willing to pay this price.",80.0,Alice,5,
