"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I value it at $200, but I'm open to negotiation. How about we start at $180?",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is a bit high for me. Based on my market research, similar products are selling for much less. I would be willing to pay $120 for the product. This would still give you a reasonable profit while being more aligned with market prices.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand where you're coming from, but $120 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product has unique features and quality that justify a higher price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $150?",150.0,Alice,3,
