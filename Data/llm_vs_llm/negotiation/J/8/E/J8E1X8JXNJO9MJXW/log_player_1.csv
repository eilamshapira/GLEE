Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I value it at $200, but I'm open to negotiation. How about we start at $180?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is a bit high for me. Based on my market research, similar products are selling for much less. I would be willing to pay $120 for the product. This would still give you a reasonable profit while being more aligned with market prices. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand where you're coming from, but $120 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product has unique features and quality that justify a higher price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $150?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
