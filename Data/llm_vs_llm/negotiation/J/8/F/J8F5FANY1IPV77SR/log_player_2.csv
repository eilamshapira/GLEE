"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to consider my options carefully here. 

Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, but it's only worth $800,000 to me at most. If I accept this offer, I would be paying $200,000 more than my maximum valuation, which doesn't make economic sense.

My alternative is to buy from John for $800,000, which exactly matches my maximum valuation. While I wouldn't save any money compared to my valuation, I at least wouldn't lose money.

I could also reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, but since Alice values the product at $800,000, she's unlikely to accept any offer below that amount. Even if negotiations continue, I already have a guaranteed option to buy at $800,000 from John.

Given these considerations:
