Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll prepare my offer to Bob.

The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and I need to get at least $8,000 (my minimum value). If Bob rejects my offer, I have a guaranteed $8,000 from John as my backup option.

Since Bob values the product at $10,000, I should offer him a price that gives him some benefit for accepting while maximizing my profit above my $8,000 minimum. If I price too close to $10,000, Bob might reject it as there's little benefit for him. A reasonable approach is to offer slightly below Bob's maximum valuation to create an incentive for him to accept.
