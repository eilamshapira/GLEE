"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since the product is worth $12,000 to me and Alice's offer of $11,000 is very close to my maximum budget, I'll consider rejecting the offer to see if I can get a better deal. However, I also don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy the product from Alice if she's not willing to lower the price further.

Given that Alice's initial offer is already high, I'll try to negotiate further. My goal is to save as much money as possible, so I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $11,000, I'll try to make a counteroffer that is reasonable and takes into account the fact that the product is worth $8,000 to Alice. I'll aim for a price that is lower than Alice's offer but still higher than her worth, to increase the chances of her accepting it.

My counteroffer will be $9,500.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has made a new offer of $10,500, which is lower than her previous offer of $11,000. This suggests that she is willing to negotiate and lower the price.

Considering that the product is worth $12,000 to me, and Alice's new offer is $10,500, I'm getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with. However, I still want to try to save some more money.

Since Alice has already lowered the price by $500, I'll try to make another counteroffer to see if she's willing to lower it further. But I'll also keep in mind that I don't want to risk losing the deal, so I'll make a counteroffer that is reasonable and not too low.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's latest offer was $10,500, I'll try to make a counteroffer that is lower than that, but still reasonable. I'll aim for a price that is closer to Alice's worth of $8,000, but not so low that she rejects it outright.

My counteroffer will be $9,800.
