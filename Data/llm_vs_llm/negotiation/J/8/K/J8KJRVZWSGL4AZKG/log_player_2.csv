"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider my options carefully. 

Alice is offering the product for $120, which is less than the $150 that John is charging. Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and Alice's offer is $30 less than my maximum value, this is a good deal.

While I could reject and make a counteroffer to try to get an even better price, I already have a reasonable offer that saves me $30 compared to buying from John. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a lower counteroffer.
