"Bob, I'm offering you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value. While I can't disclose specifics right now, I can assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me.  I'm open to negotiation, but my starting price is $1500000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, my budget is a bit tighter than your asking price. Considering I can get a similar product from John for $1500000, I'd be willing to offer you $1400000. This is based on my current understanding of the market and the value I place on the product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to settle for that price.  The value of this product is truly unique, and I believe a price closer to $1450000 would be more reflective of that.  Let's keep the conversation going.",1450000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, I can't go lower than $1450000 at this time. This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and still reflects the substantial value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1450000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $1425000, but that's my absolute maximum at this point. Let me know what you think.",1425000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. Given the unique value of this product, I believe $1440000 is a fair price that respects both our positions.  Let's see if we can find a compromise at this point.",1440000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go lower than $1440000. This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and still reflects the substantial value of the product.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us, and I hope you'll agree.",1440000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for the continued negotiation. I am starting to feel like we are not going to reach an agreement. I am still only willing to go up to $1430000. If you are unable to come to that price point, I might have to consider other options.",1430000.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, I appreciate your perseverance. While I'm still confident in the value of this product, I understand we have different perspectives.  Let's agree on $1430000 to move forward.  I'm happy to finalize the details.",1430000.0,Alice,6,AcceptOffer
