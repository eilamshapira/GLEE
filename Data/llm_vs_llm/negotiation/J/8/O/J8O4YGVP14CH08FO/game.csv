"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects its worth. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its potential.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1500000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but my budget is a little lower. Would you consider $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1200000. I understand that $1500000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your interest, I'm willing to slightly adjust my price. Would you be willing to meet me at $1400000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. I appreciate the willingness to negotiate. However, $1400000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a middle ground. Meeting in the middle at $1300000 is a reasonable suggestion, but I still have to consider the product's value to me. I'm trying to balance your budget with the product's worth. As a compromise, I could come down a bit further from my last offer. Would you be willing to consider $1350000? This is as low as I'm comfortable going while still feeling like I'm getting a fair deal for the product.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
