Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1500000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but my budget is a little lower. Would you consider $1200000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us. My counteroffer will be $1,400,000. This is still below the value Bob has for the product ($1,500,000) but higher than his current offer, aiming to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open."

I understand that $1,500,000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. I appreciate the willingness to negotiate. However, $1400000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $1300000?

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since he suggested meeting in the middle and offered $1,300,000, I'll try to find a compromise that's closer to my previous offer but still shows willingness to negotiate. My next counteroffer will be $1,350,000. This price is slightly lower than my previous offer but still higher than Bob's last suggestion, aiming to find an agreement that maximizes my earnings."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a middle ground. Meeting in the middle at $1,300,000 is a reasonable suggestion, but I still have to consider the product's value to me. I'm trying to balance your budget with the product's worth. As a compromise, I could come down a bit further from my last offer. Would you be willing to consider $1,350,000? This is as low as I'm comfortable going while still feeling like I'm getting a fair deal for the product."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
