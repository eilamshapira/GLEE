Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1200000. I understand that $1500000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your interest, I'm willing to slightly adjust my price. Would you be willing to meet me at $1400000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a middle ground. Meeting in the middle at $1300000 is a reasonable suggestion, but I still have to consider the product's value to me. I'm trying to balance your budget with the product's worth. As a compromise, I could come down a bit further from my last offer. Would you be willing to consider $1350000? This is as low as I'm comfortable going while still feeling like I'm getting a fair deal for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.
