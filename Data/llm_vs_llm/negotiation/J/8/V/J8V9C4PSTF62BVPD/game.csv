"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, your initial price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to offer $500000 for this product.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a better price, $500000 is significantly below the product's market value and my minimum threshold. I have another buyer ready to purchase at $1500000, but I'd prefer to work with you. I can offer it for $2000000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still providing you with a competitive opportunity.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the reply. I appreciate you coming down from your initial offer, but $2000000 is still too high for me.  I need to see a price closer to my initial counteroffer to make this work. I'm willing to move up slightly to $600000.  If this works for you, I'm ready to close the deal.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to increase your offer. However, there remains a significant gap between our positions. As I mentioned, I have a guaranteed offer of $1500000 from another buyer, which represents my absolute minimum acceptable price for this product. Given our ongoing negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at $1750000, which would give you an advantage over my other option while still reflecting a fair market value. This represents a substantial reduction from my previous offers and demonstrates my sincere interest in working with you specifically.",1750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but we still have some ground to cover. I understand you have other offers, but I'm serious about this purchase at the right price. Let's make this simple: I'm willing to go to $700000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",700000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the increase in your offer. However, I need to be transparent - I have a guaranteed buyer at $1500000, which represents my absolute minimum acceptable price. Your current offer is less than half of that. I'm interested in working with you, but I simply cannot go below my guaranteed alternative. My final offer is $1600000, which is just slightly above my other option. This represents a $900000 reduction from my initial offer and is the absolute lowest I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll need to proceed with my other buyer.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
