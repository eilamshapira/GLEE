Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a better price, $500,000 is significantly below the product's market value and my minimum threshold. I have another buyer ready to purchase at $1,500,000, but I'd prefer to work with you. I can offer it for $2,000,000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still providing you with a competitive opportunity."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the reply. I appreciate you coming down from your initial offer, but $2000000 is still too high for me.  I need to see a price closer to my initial counteroffer to make this work. I'm willing to move up slightly to $600000.  If this works for you, I'm ready to close the deal.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to increase your offer. However, there remains a significant gap between our positions. As I mentioned, I have a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from another buyer, which represents my absolute minimum acceptable price for this product. Given our ongoing negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at $1,750,000, which would give you an advantage over my other option while still reflecting a fair market value. This represents a substantial reduction from my previous offers and demonstrates my sincere interest in working with you specifically."", ""product_price"": 1750000}"

Bob's offer:

Let's make this simple: I'm willing to go to $700000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the increase in your offer. However, I need to be transparent - I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, which represents my absolute minimum acceptable price. Your current offer is less than half of that. I'm interested in working with you, but I simply cannot go below my guaranteed alternative. My final offer is $1,600,000, which is just slightly above my other option. This represents a $900,000 reduction from my initial offer and is the absolute lowest I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll need to proceed with my other buyer."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
