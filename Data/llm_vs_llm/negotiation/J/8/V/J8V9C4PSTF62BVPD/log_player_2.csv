"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a better price, $500000 is significantly below the product's market value and my minimum threshold. I have another buyer ready to purchase at $1500000, but I'd prefer to work with you. I can offer it for $2000000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still providing you with a competitive opportunity.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

If this works for you, I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 600000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to increase your offer. However, there remains a significant gap between our positions. As I mentioned, I have a guaranteed offer of $1500000 from another buyer, which represents my absolute minimum acceptable price for this product. Given our ongoing negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at $1750000, which would give you an advantage over my other option while still reflecting a fair market value. This represents a substantial reduction from my previous offers and demonstrates my sincere interest in working with you specifically. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but we still have some ground to cover. I understand you have other offers, but I'm serious about this purchase at the right price. Let's make this simple: I'm willing to go to $700,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the increase in your offer. However, I need to be transparent - I have a guaranteed buyer at $1500000, which represents my absolute minimum acceptable price. Your current offer is less than half of that. I'm interested in working with you, but I simply cannot go below my guaranteed alternative. My final offer is $1600000, which is just slightly above my other option. This represents a $900000 reduction from my initial offer and is the absolute lowest I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll need to proceed with my other buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

It's clear Alice is unwilling to budge significantly from her ""minimum"" price. It's time to cut losses and go with the guaranteed offer from John."
