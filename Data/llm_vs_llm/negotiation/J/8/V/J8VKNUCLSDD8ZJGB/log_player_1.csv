Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think would interest you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but I think $150 is a bit too high for me. I can offer $80 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $80 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I believe we can reach a better agreement than selling to John immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low considering the product's value. I can come down to $135, which is a fair price for this product. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 135}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I think we're still not quite there. I'm willing to raise my offer to $95, how does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and his increase from $80 to $95 suggests he's unlikely to reach $120, I'll take the guaranteed $120 from John."
