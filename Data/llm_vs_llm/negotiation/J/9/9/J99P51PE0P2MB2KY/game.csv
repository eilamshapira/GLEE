"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a product that I believe would be valuable for your needs. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $13500. This price reflects the product's true worth while still providing you with excellent value.",13500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're offering, I believe $13500 is still on the higher side. The market has similar products at lower prices. I'd be comfortable purchasing it at $11000, which I think is fair considering its value and would still provide you with a good profit margin. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on pricing, $11000 is too close to my bottom line. This product has premium features and exceptional quality that justify a higher price point. I can come down to $12800, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of what you're getting. This is considerably better than comparable products on the market when you consider all the benefits.",12800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price to $12800. It shows good faith in our negotiation. While I understand you value the product's premium features, I've done some market research and believe that $11800 would be a more accurate reflection of its value. This still gives you a healthy profit margin while allowing me to stay within my budget constraints. This offer is significantly better than your cost, and I'm ready to complete the purchase immediately at this price point.",11800.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the increase in your offer. Your research is noted, but I want to emphasize that this product has exceptional quality and features that aren't fully captured in standard market comparisons. Meeting in the middle would be fair for both of us - I can offer $12300. This represents a significant reduction from my initial price and gives you excellent value while still respecting the product's worth. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that works for both of us.",12300.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for working with me on the price. I understand your point about the product's exceptional quality. I'm prepared to meet you very close to the middle at $12000 even. This represents a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while still being reasonable for my budget. At this price point, I'm ready to finalize the purchase immediately and save us both the time of further negotiation. Does that work for you?",12000.0,Bob,6,
