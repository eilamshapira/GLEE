Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're offering, I believe $13500 is still on the higher side. The market has similar products at lower prices. I'd be comfortable purchasing it at $11000, which I think is fair considering its value and would still provide you with a good profit margin. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

This product has premium features and exceptional quality that justify a higher price point.

This is considerably better than comparable products on the market when you consider all the benefits."", ""product_price"": 12800}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price to $12800. It shows good faith in our negotiation. While I understand you value the product's premium features, I've done some market research and believe that $11800 would be a more accurate reflection of its value. This still gives you a healthy profit margin while allowing me to stay within my budget constraints. This offer is significantly better than your cost, and I'm ready to complete the purchase immediately at this price point.

Your research is noted, but I want to emphasize that this product has exceptional quality and features that aren't fully captured in standard market comparisons.
