Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's initial offer is $150, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I don't see any benefit in accepting the offer immediately. I'd like to try to negotiate a better price.

My decision is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial offer. Since I don't know the value of the product to Alice, I'll start with a relatively conservative offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $140 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Since she rejected my previous counteroffer of $120, I'll try to meet her halfway.

My decision is to reject Alice's offer of $140 and proceed to the next round, where I will send a new counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's latest offer was $140, and my previous offer was $120, I'll try to split the difference and make a counteroffer of $130.
