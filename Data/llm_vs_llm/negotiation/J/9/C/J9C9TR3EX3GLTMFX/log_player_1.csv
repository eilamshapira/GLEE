"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 300}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, $50 is far too low. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer, but I need to consider my strategy carefully. Since I have 10 rounds and John is waiting, I need to see if Bob is serious.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, I'll try a lower price than my original, but still a good margin above my minimum. This will hopefully show Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I know the product's worth.

```json
{""product_price"": 275}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, Bob is still lowballing me. $75 is not acceptable. However, the fact that he increased his offer slightly indicates he might be interested. I need to decide if it's worth trying to negotiate further or just taking the guaranteed $150 from John. Since it's only round 4, I'll try one more counteroffer and see how he responds.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, let's try meeting him a little closer to the middle, but still firmly above my bottom line.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, Bob's moving up, but still significantly below my target. At this point, I'm starting to think he's not going to go high enough to make it worthwhile. However, I'll try one more counteroffer before I resort to selling to John.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, I'm going to make a more significant drop to see if Bob will actually budge. This is getting close to the point where John is the better option.
