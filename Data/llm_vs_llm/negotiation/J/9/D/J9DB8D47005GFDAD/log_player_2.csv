"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $12,000. Since my maximum value for the product is $15,000, and Alice is offering it for $12,000, this seems like a reasonable offer. It's $3,000 less than my maximum willingness to pay and also $3,000 less than John's alternative price.

While I could try to negotiate further to get an even better price, Alice's initial offer is already quite good. Given that there's always a risk in negotiation that the price could go up or the deal could fall through, accepting this offer seems prudent.
