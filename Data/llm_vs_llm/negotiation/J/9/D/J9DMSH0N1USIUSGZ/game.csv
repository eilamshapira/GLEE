"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be honest - $1450000 is very close to what I could pay elsewhere. Given that this product has a market value closer to $1200000-$1300000, I believe a more reasonable price would be $1300000. This would still provide you with a healthy profit while giving me enough value to choose your product over alternatives. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your honest and detailed response. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I must consider the product's true value to you, and I believe $1300000 is a bit below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still be getting an excellent deal.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a middle ground. Your willingness to negotiate shows good faith. However, I still think we can find a price that works even better for both of us. Given that I have the option to purchase elsewhere for $1500000, I'm looking for more significant savings to make this deal worthwhile. Would you consider $1330000? This still gives you a substantial profit while providing me with the savings I need to justify choosing your offer over alternatives. I think this represents a fair value for both of us.",1330000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial price. I understand that you're looking for significant savings, and I'm willing to consider that. However, I still believe the product's value to you warrants a slightly higher price. I'm willing to make a small concession from my previous offer. I think this new price strikes a fair balance between our interests.",1362500.0,Alice,5,
