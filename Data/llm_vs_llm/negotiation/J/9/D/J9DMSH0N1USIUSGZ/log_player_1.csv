Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be honest - $1450000 is very close to what I could pay elsewhere. Given that this product has a market value closer to $1200000-$1300000, I believe a more reasonable price would be $1300000. This would still provide you with a healthy profit while giving me enough value to choose your product over alternatives. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

However, I must consider the product's true value to you, and I believe $1,300,000 is a bit below what I'm comfortable with.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a middle ground. Your willingness to negotiate shows good faith. However, I still think we can find a price that works even better for both of us. Given that I have the option to purchase elsewhere for $1500000, I'm looking for more significant savings to make this deal worthwhile. Would you consider $1330000? This still gives you a substantial profit while providing me with the savings I need to justify choosing your offer over alternatives. I think this represents a fair value for both of us.
