Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is lower than my minimum price of $10,000 and also lower than what I know he's willing to pay ($12,000), I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Considering Bob's initial rejection and his offer of $9,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's still closer to what I believe the product is worth to him, but slightly lower than my initial offer to show some flexibility.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $9,500 is still lower than what I believe he's willing to pay ($12,000), but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Since selling to John for $10,000 is still an option and Bob's offer is only $500 less than that, I'll reject Bob's offer again and try to get a better price from him.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Given that Bob's last offer was $9,500, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one, trying to meet him halfway and create a sense of progress in the negotiation.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $10,000 matches the price I can get from John, and it's the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Since I've reached my minimum acceptable price and Bob is willing to pay it, I'll accept his offer. There's no need to continue negotiating or consider selling to John, as the terms are the same.
