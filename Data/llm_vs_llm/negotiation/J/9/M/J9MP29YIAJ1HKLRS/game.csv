"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product but would only be able to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $80 is too low considering the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $100? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $100 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? I'm really interested in the product and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,
