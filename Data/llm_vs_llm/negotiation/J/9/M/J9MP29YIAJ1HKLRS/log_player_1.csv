"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $120. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product but would only be able to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. I see Bob is interested but their offer is at my minimum acceptable price. Since we're still early in the negotiations, I'll try to find a middle ground.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $80 is too low considering the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $100? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $80 is too low considering the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $100? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $100 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? I'm really interested in the product and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $90. This is a reasonable compromise that gives me $10 more than John's standing offer of $80, and Bob has shown good faith in negotiating by meeting me halfway from their previous offer. Given that we're already in round 4 and this is a fair price above my minimum threshold, it makes sense to close the deal now."
