"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price. I'm willing to compromise and lower the price, but $80 is the lowest I can go if I were to sell it to another buyer. Considering this, I'd like to offer it to you for $110. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $110 is still a little outside my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $95? I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm glad to hear that you're serious about buying the product. Considering your offer, I'm willing to come down a bit more. I'd like to offer the product to you for $105. This is a good compromise between our initial prices, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down again. $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with, but I'm definitely willing to go a bit higher. How about $100? This feels like a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal.",100.0,Bob,6,
