"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1500000 is significantly above my budget. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $1000000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $800000 for the product? This would be beneficial for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in doing business with me. While I understand your budget constraints, $800000 is below the minimum value I can accept. The product is highly sought after, and I can guarantee $1200000 from another buyer. However, because I value the opportunity to work with you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. I believe this price fairly reflects the product's value and our potential partnership.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
