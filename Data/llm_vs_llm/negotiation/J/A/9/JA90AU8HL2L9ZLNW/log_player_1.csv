Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1500000 is significantly above my budget. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $1000000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $800000 for the product? This would be beneficial for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I understand your budget constraints, $800,000 is below the minimum value I can accept. The product is highly sought after, and I can guarantee $1,200,000 from another buyer. However, because I value the opportunity to work with you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000.
