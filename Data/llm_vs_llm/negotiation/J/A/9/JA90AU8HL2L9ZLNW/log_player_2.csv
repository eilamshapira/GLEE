"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product at a competitive price. Given its unique features and value, the price is set at $1500000. Let me know if you're interested or if you have any counteroffers in mind. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,000,000 and also higher than John's price. Since I can get the product from John for $1,000,000, there's no reason to accept a price that's $500,000 higher. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer that's below John's price. If Alice doesn't agree to a lower price, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $1,000,000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $800,000 for the product? This would be beneficial for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in doing business with me. While I understand your budget constraints, $800000 is below the minimum value I can accept. The product is highly sought after, and I can guarantee $1200000 from another buyer. However, because I value the opportunity to work with you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. I believe this price fairly reflects the product's value and our potential partnership. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's new offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly above John's price of $1,000,000 and above my maximum value, and Alice has indicated she has another buyer at $1,200,000, it's unlikely she'll go below $1,000,000. The most rational decision is to buy from John at $1,000,000 rather than continue negotiating or accept a higher price from Alice."
