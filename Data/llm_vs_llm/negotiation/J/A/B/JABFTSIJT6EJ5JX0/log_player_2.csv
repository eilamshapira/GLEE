"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10000 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $10,000 is below my maximum budget of $12,000, I have room to potentially negotiate a better price. However, $10,000 is also a significant amount, and without knowing the product's value to Alice or its market value, it's difficult to determine if this is a good starting point for negotiations.

Given that I want to save as much money as possible and that $10,000 is a bit high for an initial offer from my perspective (considering I'm aiming to spend no more than $12,000 and would like to spend less if possible), I'll choose to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. This approach allows me to test the waters and see if Alice is willing to come down in price.

My decision is to reject the offer and proceed with making a counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To make a strategic counteroffer, I'll consider starting with a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to create room for negotiation. Since my goal is to spend no more than $12,000 and ideally less, I'll start by offering a price that is lower than Alice's but still within a reasonable range to keep the negotiation open.

Given Alice's initial offer of $10,000, I'll counteroffer with a price of $8,000. This price is lower than Alice's offer, indicating my desire to pay less, but it's also not so low that it would immediately end the negotiation, assuming Alice is somewhat flexible.
