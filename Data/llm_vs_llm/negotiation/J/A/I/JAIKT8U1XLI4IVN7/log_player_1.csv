Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a reasonable price to offer to Bob that maximizes my potential profit while ensuring I don't lose the sale entirely.

Since I know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I have John as a guaranteed backup buyer at exactly that price, I can set my offer to Bob higher than that amount. 

I don't know how much Bob values the product, but setting the price too high risks Bob rejecting the offer. I want to find a balance between extracting more value than my guaranteed $1,200,000 while still making it attractive enough for Bob to accept.

A reasonable approach would be to offer Bob a price that represents a moderate premium over my guaranteed alternative:

{""product_price"": 1,550,000}"
