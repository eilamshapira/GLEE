,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. I can find similar products for much less elsewhere. I would be willing to pay $100 for the product.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, after considering your feedback, I'm willing to lower my price. I can offer you the product for $170. This is a fair price considering the quality and value of the item.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $170 is still too high for me. I know what similar products are selling for in the market. I can go up to $110 for your product. This is a fair offer considering market prices.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really want to make this deal happen, so I'm willing to come down even further. Let's meet in the middle at $155. This is a very fair price for a product of this quality.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price, Alice. However, $155 is still more than I can justify spending. I can increase my offer to $115. This is very close to my maximum budget, and I hope you can understand my position. I have other options available to me at $120, so I need a better price than that to make this deal work.",115.0,Bob,6,
