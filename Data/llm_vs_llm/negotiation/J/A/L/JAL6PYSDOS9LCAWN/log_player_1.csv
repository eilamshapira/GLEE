Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. I can find similar products for much less elsewhere. I would be willing to pay $100 for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price, Alice. However, $155 is still more than I can justify spending. I can increase my offer to $115. This is very close to my maximum budget, and I hope you can understand my position. I have other options available to me at $120, so I need a better price than that to make this deal work.

I've decided to sell the product to another buyer who has offered me $150. I wish you the best in finding a product that fits your budget. If you ever need a similar product in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out.
Take care, and maybe next time we can make a deal work!""}"
