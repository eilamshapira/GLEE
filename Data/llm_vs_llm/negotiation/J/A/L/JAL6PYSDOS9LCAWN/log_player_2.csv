"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $200. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering the product for $200
2. The product is only worth $120 to me
3. I can buy it from John for $120 anytime
4. Alice's offer is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price

Since $200 is well above my maximum value of $120, and I have John's guaranteed offer of $120, there's no reason to accept this high price. I should reject and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but leaves room for negotiation:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. I can find similar products for much less elsewhere. I would be willing to pay $100 for the product."", ""product_price"": 100}

I chose $100 because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $120
2. It's below John's price of $120
3. It gives room for negotiation upward if Alice counters
4. It's not so low as to be insulting, considering the product is worth $150 to Alice"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after considering your feedback, I'm willing to lower my price. I can offer you the product for $170. This is a fair price considering the quality and value of the item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $200 to $170
2. However, $170 is still:
   - Above my maximum value ($120)
   - Above John's guaranteed price ($120)
3. There's no reason to accept a price that's higher than both my maximum value and my alternative option
4. We still have several rounds left for negotiation

Since I can get the product from John for $120 at any time, and $170 is still significantly above that price, I should reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $170 is still too high for me. I know what similar products are selling for in the market. I can go up to $110 for your product. This is a fair offer considering market prices."", ""product_price"": 110}

I'm offering $110 because:
1. It's a small increase from my previous offer of $100, showing I'm willing to negotiate
2. It's still below my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120)
3. While it's below Alice's cost ($150), she might continue negotiating to find a middle ground
4. If Alice continues to make high counteroffers, I still have John's option as a backup"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I really want to make this deal happen, so I'm willing to come down even further. Let's meet in the middle at $155. This is a very fair price for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice has reduced her price again from $170 to $155
2. However, $155 is still:
   - Above my maximum value ($120)
   - Above John's guaranteed price ($120)
   - Above Alice's cost ($150), so she still has room to negotiate
3. There's no reason to accept a price that's higher than my alternative option
4. We're halfway through the rounds, and Alice has shown willingness to reduce price

At this point, while Alice is moving in the right direction, $155 is still significantly above both my maximum value and John's price. Since I can always get the product from John for $120, there's no reason to accept a higher price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price, Alice. However, $155 is still more than I can justify spending. I can increase my offer to $115. This is very close to my maximum budget, and I hope you can understand my position. I have other options available to me at $120, so I need a better price than that to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 115}

I'm offering $115 because:
1. It's another small increase from my previous offer ($110), showing continued good faith negotiation
2. It's still below my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120)
3. I've explicitly mentioned the $120 alternative to signal to Alice that she needs to beat this price
4. It's approaching the maximum I'm willing to pay while still leaving me some room to negotiate if needed
5. By being transparent about my alternative option, I'm hoping Alice will realize she needs to make a more competitive offer"
