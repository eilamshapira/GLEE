"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer matches your maximum budget, there's a chance to get a better price.  It makes sense to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to go lower.  You always have John's offer as a backup if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6500}
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a significantly lower offer (but not ridiculously low) allows room for negotiation and helps gauge Alice's bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice reducing her price by $1,000 indicates a willingness to negotiate. There's still room to work with before reaching your maximum budget. Let's try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer and Alice's current offer. It shows you are willing to move closer to her price, but you still believe the product is worth less than her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting close, but Alice is steadily coming down. This suggests there's still some negotiating room. The potential savings outweigh the risk of losing the deal at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer is a strategic move, again splitting the difference but staying slightly above the halfway point between Alice's current offer and our previous one. It signals a willingness to compromise but keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price further."
