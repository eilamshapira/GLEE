"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $120 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know the fair market value is lower. I can find this product elsewhere for $100, but I'd prefer to buy from you. Given that, I'd like to offer you $85 for the product, which should still give you a reasonable profit. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to buy from me. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a price that's closer to the market value you mentioned. I'd be willing to sell it to you for $110, which is still a great deal considering the product's quality and condition. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for lowering your price, Alice, but $110 is still more than I want to pay. As I mentioned, I can purchase this item elsewhere for $100, so I don't have an incentive to pay more than that. However, I'd like to continue doing business with you. I'm willing to offer $90, which gives you a decent profit while giving me some savings compared to my alternative option. Does that work for you?",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I understand that you can get the product elsewhere for $100, but I'm trying to get a fair price for it. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and the market value. I'd be willing to sell it to you for $105, and I think that's a reasonable compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I still can't justify paying $105 when I have a guaranteed option to purchase this product for $100 from another seller. Since I know the product costs you $80, I'm offering $95, which gives you a $15 profit and saves me $5 compared to my alternative. This creates value for both of us. If we can't agree on a price below $100, I'll unfortunately need to go with the other seller.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns and the fact that you have an alternative option. I appreciate your transparency about the product's cost and the value it creates for both of us. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to make a final compromise. I'd be willing to sell it to you for $100, which is the market value you mentioned earlier. This way, you won't have to go with the other seller, and I'll get a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thanks for meeting the market price of $100, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Since we've come this far in our negotiation, and I know your cost is $80, I'd like to propose $97 as our final price. This gives you a solid $17 profit while giving me a small discount compared to my alternative. It's a small difference, but it makes the deal worthwhile for both of us. What do you say to closing the deal at $97?",97.0,Bob,8,
