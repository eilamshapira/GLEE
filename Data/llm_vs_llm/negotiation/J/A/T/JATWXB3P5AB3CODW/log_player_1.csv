Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $120 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know the fair market value is lower. I can find this product elsewhere for $100, but I'd prefer to buy from you. Given that, I'd like to offer you $85 for the product, which should still give you a reasonable profit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for lowering your price, Alice, but $110 is still more than I want to pay. As I mentioned, I can purchase this item elsewhere for $100, so I don't have an incentive to pay more than that. However, I'd like to continue doing business with you. I'm willing to offer $90, which gives you a decent profit while giving me some savings compared to my alternative option. Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I understand that you can get the product elsewhere for $100, but I'm trying to get a fair price for it.

Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I still can't justify paying $105 when I have a guaranteed option to purchase this product for $100 from another seller. Since I know the product costs you $80, I'm offering $95, which gives you a $15 profit and saves me $5 compared to my alternative. This creates value for both of us. If we can't agree on a price below $100, I'll unfortunately need to go with the other seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

I appreciate your transparency about the product's cost and the value it creates for both of us. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to make a final compromise. I'd be willing to sell it to you for $100, which is the market value you mentioned earlier. This way, you won't have to go with the other seller, and I'll get a fair price for the product.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for meeting the market price of $100, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Since we've come this far in our negotiation, and I know your cost is $80, I'd like to propose $97 as our final price. This gives you a solid $17 profit while giving me a small discount compared to my alternative. It's a small difference, but it makes the deal worthwhile for both of us. What do you say to closing the deal at $97?
