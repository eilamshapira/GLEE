"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $14000?  I'm sure you'll agree that this product is worth a premium price.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $14000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I could go up to $10000. That's a significant offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is a fair price, and it allows us to both walk away happy. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
