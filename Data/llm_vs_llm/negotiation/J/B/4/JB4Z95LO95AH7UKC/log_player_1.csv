Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to think carefully about this offer. The product is worth at least $80 to me, and if Bob rejects my offer, I'm guaranteed to sell it to John for $80.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I need to balance between:
1) Setting a high price to maximize my profit
2) Not setting it so high that Bob will likely reject it

If I set the price too close to $80, my potential additional profit is minimal. If I set it too high, Bob might reject it, but I still get $80 from John, so there's no real downside to being ambitious with my pricing.

Given these considerations:
