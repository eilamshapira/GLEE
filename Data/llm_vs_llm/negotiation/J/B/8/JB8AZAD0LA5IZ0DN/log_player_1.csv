Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $120. It's a great product and I think you'll find it very valuable. Are you interested?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I'm interested, $120 is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 100}

Explanation: I chose to counteroffer at $100 because it is halfway between my initial offer ($120) and Bob's counteroffer ($80). This shows goodwill in the negotiation and keeps the product's price above my reserve price of $80. If Bob accepts, I will make a profit of $20. If he declines, I can still sell the product to John for $80."
