(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Given that Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value ($15,000), and significantly lower than my initial offer, I will reject it and make a counteroffer.

There's no advantage in continuing the negotiation or switching to John when the price is the same.
