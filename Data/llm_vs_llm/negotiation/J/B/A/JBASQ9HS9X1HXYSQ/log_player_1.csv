""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $2,300,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 
 
This offer aims to strike a balance:
* **High starting point:**  Starting significantly above your minimum price provides room for negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer.
* **Justification for the price:** While you don't know Bob's perceived value, mentioning ""unique value and potential"" might pique his interest and justify the high price. 
* **Clear and decisive:** ""Take-it-or-leave-it"" signals that you're serious and this is your best offer.  

**Reasoning:**  You are trying to gauge Bob's interest while maximizing your potential profit. If Bob accepts this initial high price, you've significantly exceeded your minimum. If he rejects it, you still have the safety net of John's offer."
