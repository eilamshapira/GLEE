"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. I believe it would be valuable for you. I'm willing to sell it for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $180 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. The product is worth at most $100 to me, and I can actually get it from another seller at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. Would you consider selling it for $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $70 as it's significantly below my cost. You mentioned you can get it for $100 elsewhere, so I'll offer it to you for $140, which is a fair price considering the quality and value of the product. This is already a substantial reduction from my initial offer.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down in price, Alice, but $140 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I can buy the same product from John for $100, which is already the maximum value for me. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer $85. This gives you a sale today and saves me a bit compared to my alternative option.",85.0,Bob,4,
