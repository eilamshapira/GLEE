"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. I believe it would be valuable for you. I'm willing to sell it for $180."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $180 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. The product is worth at most $100 to me, and I can actually get it from another seller at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. Would you consider selling it for $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Based on Bob's message, I know that he values the product at around $100, since he mentioned he can get it from another seller at that price. Also, I have a guaranteed option to sell to John for $120, which is my minimum acceptable price. Therefore, I'll reject Bob's low offer of $70 and make a new counteroffer in the next round that's closer to his stated maximum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $70 as it's significantly below my cost. You mentioned you can get it for $100 elsewhere, so I'll offer it to you for $140, which is a fair price considering the quality and value of the product. This is already a substantial reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down in price, Alice, but $140 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I can buy the same product from John for $100, which is already the maximum value for me. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer $85. This gives you a sale today and saves me a bit compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob has revealed that his maximum value is $100, and his alternative option is buying from John (though this seems inconsistent with my knowledge that John is willing to buy from me for $120). Since Bob won't go above $100, and I have a guaranteed option to sell to John for $120, it's best to take John's offer now rather than continue negotiating with Bob. The negotiation with Bob won't lead to a price above $120, so selling to John is the profit-maximizing choice."
