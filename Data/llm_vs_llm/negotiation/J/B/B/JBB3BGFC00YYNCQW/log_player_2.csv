"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. I believe it would be valuable for you. I'm willing to sell it for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that I'm looking for a product that is worth no more than $100 to me, and John is offering it for exactly $100, Alice's offer of $180 is clearly not beneficial to me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $180 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. The product is worth at most $100 to me, and I can actually get it from another seller at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. Would you consider selling it for $70?"", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $70 as it's significantly below my cost. You mentioned you can get it for $100 elsewhere, so I'll offer it to you for $140, which is a fair price considering the quality and value of the product. This is already a substantial reduction from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer of $140 is still higher than John's price of $100, and the product is only worth up to $100 to me, this offer doesn't make economic sense for me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down in price, Alice, but $140 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I can buy the same product from John for $100, which is already the maximum value for me. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer $85. This gives you a sale today and saves me a bit compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 85}"
