"Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Based on the information provided:
- The product is worth no more than $15,000 to you
- Alice is offering to sell it to you for $25,000
- John is willing to sell the same product for $15,000

Since Alice's offer ($25,000) is significantly higher than both your valuation ($15,000) and John's alternative offer ($15,000), the rational choice is to buy from John.
