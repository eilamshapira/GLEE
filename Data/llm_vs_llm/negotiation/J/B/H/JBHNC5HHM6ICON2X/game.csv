"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit high for my budget. Given that I can find similar products elsewhere, I'd like to offer $80 for it. This is a fair price that would work well for me.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest and counteroffer, Bob. However, $80 is too low considering the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $100? This is a more reasonable price that reflects the product's quality.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet at $90? That's a fair middle ground between our positions, and I'm willing to complete the purchase right now at that price.",90.0,Bob,4,
