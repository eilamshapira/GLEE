"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $120. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit high for my budget. Given that I can find similar products elsewhere, I'd like to offer $80 for it. This is a fair price that would work well for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. Since Bob indicated interest but found $120 too high, I'll try to find a middle ground.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest and counteroffer, Bob. However, $80 is too low considering the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $100? This is a more reasonable price that reflects the product's quality."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest and counteroffer, Bob. However, $80 is too low considering the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $100? This is a more reasonable price that reflects the product's quality."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet at $90? That's a fair middle ground between our positions, and I'm willing to complete the purchase right now at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $90. This is a good outcome because:
1. It's $10 more than what John is offering ($80)
2. Bob seems to have reached his maximum willingness to pay
3. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether
4. We've found a fair middle ground that benefits both parties"
