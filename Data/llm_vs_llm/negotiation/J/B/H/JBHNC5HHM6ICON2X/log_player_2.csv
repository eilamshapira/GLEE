"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $120. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given that Alice's offer ($120) is the same as John's price ($120), and I know the product is worth no more than $120 to me, I should try to negotiate with Alice for a better price. Since I have 10 rounds of negotiation available and there's no penalty for negotiating, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be unreasonable.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit high for my budget. Given that I can find similar products elsewhere, I'd like to offer $80 for it. This is a fair price that would work well for me."", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest and counteroffer, Bob. However, $80 is too low considering the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $100? This is a more reasonable price that reflects the product's quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has reduced her price from $120 to $100, which is a significant improvement and $20 less than John's price. However, since she came down from her initial offer, there might still be room for negotiation. With 7 rounds still remaining, I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $20 from her initial offer, I'll increase my previous offer by a similar amount to show good faith in the negotiation.

{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet at $90? That's a fair middle ground between our positions, and I'm willing to complete the purchase right now at that price."", ""product_price"": 90}"
