Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have this fantastic product I think you'll really love. I'm offering it to you for $95."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice, but I think $95 is a bit high. How about I buy it for $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, considering Bob's counteroffer of $70, I have to make a decision. Selling to John gets me $80, which is more than Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
