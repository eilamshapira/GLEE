,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the interest, Bob! I appreciate the offer, but I can't go down to $60. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down from $180, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about we settle at $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Alright Bob, I'm still eager to sell this to you. I'm going to have to hold firm at $155, I just can't go lower than that and still make it worth my time. What do you say?",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you need to make it worth your time, but $155 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need you to come down a bit more. How about $120? It's a significant increase from my previous offers, and I think it's a fair price.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I still can't go that low. I'm already cutting into my profit margin. Look, let's split the difference one last time and say $137.50. That's my final offer.",137.5,Alice,7,
