"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $140 is a bit high for my budget. I've been looking around and I believe $125 would be a fair price for this product. That still gives you a good return while helping me stay within my budget. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $132.50?  That gives us both a good deal.",132.5,Alice,3,
