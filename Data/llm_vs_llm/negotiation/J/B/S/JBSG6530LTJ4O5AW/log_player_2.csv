"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll analyze this offer:

The product is worth up to $150 to me, so Alice's offer of $140 is within my acceptable range.
However, I know Alice values the product at $120, so there's room for negotiation.
John's fixed price is $150, which is my absolute maximum and $10 more than Alice's current offer.

Since I can make a counteroffer to Alice and potentially save more money (compared to both her current offer and John's price), I should try negotiating first.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $140 is a bit high for my budget. I've been looking around and I believe $125 would be a fair price for this product. That still gives you a good return while helping me stay within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $132.50?  That gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll analyze Alice's counter-proposal:

Alice has reduced her price from $140 to $132.50, meeting me halfway between her initial offer and my counteroffer.
This price of $132.50 is $17.50 less than John's fixed price of $150.
The price is now $12.50 above Alice's cost of $120.

This is a reasonable compromise that saves me a good amount compared to my maximum value and John's price. While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has already shown flexibility, and the current offer is quite good.
