"Hello Bob! I have a valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18000. This is a competitive price for the value you'll receive. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling me this product, but I have to be honest - $18000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $8000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I can offer you $6500 for the product. This is lower than my alternative option, which gives me some incentive to do business with you instead.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I must decline your offer of $6500. This price is significantly below the product's value. You mentioned having another seller offering it at $8000, but I can assure you of the superior quality and value of my product. Given our previous discussions, I'm willing to adjust my price to $15500. This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer and reflects the true value of the product. Keep in mind that similar products in the market are priced even higher.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for reducing your price, Alice, but $15500 is still well above my maximum budget of $8000 for this product. As I mentioned, I have a confirmed offer from another seller at $8000, so there's no incentive for me to pay more than that. However, I'd still prefer to do business with you if possible. My offer is $7000, which is below my alternative option but gives you a quick sale. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to go with the other seller.",7000.0,Bob,4,
