Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling me this product, but I have to be honest - $18000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $8000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I can offer you $6500 for the product. This is lower than my alternative option, which gives me some incentive to do business with you instead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. Bob's offer of $6,500 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. The fact that he claims to have another seller offering the same product for $8,000 seems questionable, especially since he's offering me less than that amount. I'll continue negotiating but will maintain a firm position given that I have a guaranteed backup option with John at $12,000.

Please let me proceed with making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I must decline your offer of $6,500. This price is significantly below the product's value. You mentioned having another seller offering it at $8,000, but I can assure you of the superior quality and value of my product. Given our previous discussions, I'm willing to adjust my price to $15,500. This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer and reflects the true value of the product. Keep in mind that similar products in the market are priced even higher."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for reducing your price, Alice, but $15500 is still well above my maximum budget of $8000 for this product. As I mentioned, I have a confirmed offer from another seller at $8000, so there's no incentive for me to pay more than that. However, I'd still prefer to do business with you if possible. My offer is $7000, which is below my alternative option but gives you a quick sale. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to go with the other seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've decided to sell to John for $12,000. Bob's repeated offers well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, combined with his insistence on having another seller at $8,000, makes it clear we're unlikely to reach a mutually acceptable price. Since Bob won't budge above $8,000 (and is actually offering less), and I have a guaranteed $12,000 from John, it's in my best interest to take the sure deal with John rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to reach my minimum threshold."
