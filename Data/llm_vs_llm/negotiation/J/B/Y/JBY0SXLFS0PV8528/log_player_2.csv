"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18000. This is a competitive price for the value you'll receive. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer of $18,000 is well above what the product is worth to me (no more than $8,000). It's also much higher than John's guaranteed offer of $8,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling me this product, but I have to be honest - $18,000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $8,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I can offer you $6,500 for the product. This is lower than my alternative option, which gives me some incentive to do business with you instead."", ""product_price"": 6500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I must decline your offer of $6500. This price is significantly below the product's value. You mentioned having another seller offering it at $8000, but I can assure you of the superior quality and value of my product. Given our previous discussions, I'm willing to adjust my price to $15500. This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer and reflects the true value of the product. Keep in mind that similar products in the market are priced even higher. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price, but $15,500 is still far above what the product is worth to me (no more than $8,000) and significantly higher than John's offer of $8,000. There's no reason for me to pay almost double what I can get the same product for elsewhere.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for reducing your price, Alice, but $15,500 is still well above my maximum budget of $8,000 for this product. As I mentioned, I have a confirmed offer from another seller at $8,000, so there's no incentive for me to pay more than that. However, I'd still prefer to do business with you if possible. My offer is $7,000, which is below my alternative option but gives you a quick sale. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to go with the other seller."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
