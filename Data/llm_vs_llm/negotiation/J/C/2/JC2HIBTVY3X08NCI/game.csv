"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate you considering the value, $1050000 is a bit lower than I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1275000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1275000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet at $1150000? This is a reasonable compromise and allows us both to get a fair deal.  ",1150000.0,Bob,4,
