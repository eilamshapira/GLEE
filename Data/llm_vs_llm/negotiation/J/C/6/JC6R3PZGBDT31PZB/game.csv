"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product and for making an offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14000, considering the product's exceptional quality and rarity. I'm open to further discussion, but I believe this price is more in line with its value.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your point about the product's quality, but $14000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000. Let's meet in the middle. If you're not open to that, I might have to consider other options.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. Considering your interest in the product and its value, I'm willing to compromise at $13750. This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",13750.0,Alice,5,
