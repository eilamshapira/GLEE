"Bob, I'm excited you're considering purchasing this product. It's a truly exceptional piece, and I believe it could be incredibly valuable to you. To start, I'm offering it to you for $25000.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but I think there's quite a gap in our price expectations. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $8000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but my budget is limited. I can offer you $5500 for the product, which would be a fair deal for both of us.",5500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand you have other options, but I genuinely believe you're underestimating the value this product holds, especially compared to what John is offering. While I can't go as low as $5500, I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial price. How about $22000?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for lowering your price, Alice, but $22000 is still far beyond what I can justify paying. As I mentioned, the product is only worth up to $8000 to me, and I can purchase it from John at exactly that price. To be clear, I'm not trying to negotiate you down unreasonably - that's genuinely the market value from my perspective. I'm willing to offer $6000, which gives you a better deal than I'd get elsewhere, but remains within my budget constraints.",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty. While $6000 is too low for me, I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle *between your perceived value of $8000 and my minimum acceptable price of $10000*? I'll offer it to you for $19000.",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I think there might be some confusion. You mentioned meeting in the middle between $8000 (my maximum value) and your minimum of $10000, but then offered $19000, which isn't in the middle. To be completely transparent, I have a firm alternative option to purchase this exact product from John for $8000. That means I cannot logically pay more than $8000 regardless of your minimum price. If your minimum is truly $10000, then unfortunately we may not be able to reach an agreement. However, I'm still willing to offer $6500 if you'd like to continue our negotiation, which is better than not making a sale at all.",6500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"You are absolutely right, Bob, my apologies for the confusion in the previous message. My thought process wasn't clear. Okay, let's try this: Given that you have a solid offer from John for $8000, I understand you can't go much higher. To make this worth your while, I'll come down significantly. How about $16000?",16000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still not seeing why I should pay $16000 when I can get the exact same product for $8000 from John. That's simply not a rational economic decision for me. The product is worth a maximum of $8000 to me - that's my ceiling. I understand you're trying to get the best price possible, but I need to be practical. My final offer is $7000, which is actually $1000 less than I would pay elsewhere. If we can't agree on a price at or below $8000, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.",7000.0,Bob,8,
