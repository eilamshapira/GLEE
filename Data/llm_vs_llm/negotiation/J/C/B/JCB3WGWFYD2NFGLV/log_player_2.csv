"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Here's my analysis and decision:

*   **My Goal:** Buy the product for as little as possible, but no more than $120.
*   **Alice's Offer:** $100.
*   **John's Offer:** $120.

Since I can buy the product from Alice for $100, and it's worth $120 to me, it's a good deal compared to John's offer.

Therefore, I will accept Alice's offer.
