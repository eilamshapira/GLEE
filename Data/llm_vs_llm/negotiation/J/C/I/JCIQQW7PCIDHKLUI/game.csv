"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate it's below the market rate of $12000, I'd like to propose a more mutually beneficial price. Since I know you're looking to make a reasonable profit on the product, I'd like to offer $10500 for it. This gives you a $500 profit while saving me a significant amount compared to other options. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm aiming for a higher profit margin. Would you consider a price of $11000? This way, we both gain more from the transaction.",11000.0,Alice,3,
