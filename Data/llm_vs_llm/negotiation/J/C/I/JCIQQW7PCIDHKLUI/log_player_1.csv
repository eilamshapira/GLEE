"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate it's below the market rate of $12000, I'd like to propose a more mutually beneficial price. Since I know you're looking to make a reasonable profit on the product, I'd like to offer $10500 for it. This gives you a $500 profit while saving me a significant amount compared to other options. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
