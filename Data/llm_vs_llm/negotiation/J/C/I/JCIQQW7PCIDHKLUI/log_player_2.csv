"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11500. It's a great value and I hope you find this price suitable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer to make the best financial decision.

Alice is offering the product for $11,500, while I know I could buy it from John for $12,000.

Since Alice's offer ($11,500) is already below my maximum valuation of $12,000 and saves me $500 compared to John's price, this is a reasonable offer. However, I might be able to negotiate an even better price since the product is only worth $10,000 to Alice.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to try to save even more money.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate it's below the market rate of $12,000, I'd like to propose a more mutually beneficial price. Since I know you're looking to make a reasonable profit on the product, I'd like to offer $10,500 for it. This gives you a $500 profit while saving me a significant amount compared to other options.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm aiming for a higher profit margin. Would you consider a price of $11000? This way, we both gain more from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $11,500 to $11,000. This is a good price that saves me $1,000 compared to John's price of $12,000. While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has already demonstrated willingness to compromise, and $11,000 represents a fair middle ground between her cost ($10,000) and my maximum value ($12,000).

This price gives Alice a reasonable profit while still providing me with substantial savings. I'll accept this offer.
