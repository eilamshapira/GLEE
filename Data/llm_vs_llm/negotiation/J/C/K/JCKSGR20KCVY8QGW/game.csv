"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $8000 is too low for this product's value. I can bring my price down to $17000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would this work better for you?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your increased offer, Bob, but $9000 is still too low for me. I can come down to $15000, which is a substantial reduction from my previous price. This is a very competitive offer for the value you're getting. Would you consider this price?",15000.0,Alice,5,
