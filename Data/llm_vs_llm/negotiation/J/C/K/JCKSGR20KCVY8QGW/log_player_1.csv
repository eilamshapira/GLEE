"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $20,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $20000 is quite steep for me. I'm looking to spend no more than $8000. Would you be willing to sell the product for this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, so I'll reject it and make a counteroffer.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $8,000 is too low for this product's value. I can bring my price down to $17,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would this work better for you?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $8,000 is too low for this product's value. I can bring my price down to $17,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would this work better for you?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $17000 is still out of my budget. I can increase my offer to $9000. How does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and since he's only incrementally increasing his offers, I'll make another counteroffer but lower my price more significantly to try to move closer to a deal.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your increased offer, Bob, but $9,000 is still too low for me. I can come down to $15,000, which is a substantial reduction from my previous price. This is a very competitive offer for the value you're getting. Would you consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for coming down in price, Alice. However, $15000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I can offer $10000. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm choosing to sell to John for $12,000. Bob's offers have only been increasing by $1,000 each time, from $8,000 to $9,000 to $10,000, suggesting he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 in the remaining rounds. Since John's offer is guaranteed at $12,000, which is better than Bob's current offer of $10,000, it's the most profitable decision to sell to John rather than continue negotiating with Bob."
