"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is well above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $12000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let me know if this works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $12000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price for this product. I understand budget constraints, but I need to ensure I'm receiving fair value. I can come down from my initial offer - I'm willing to sell the product for $22000, which represents a significant discount from my original price. This product has exceptional quality and features that justify this price point. Would you be able to meet me at this price?",22000.0,Alice,3,
