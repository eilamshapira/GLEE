Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm offering for $25,000. This is a fair market price for a product of this caliber.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is well above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $12000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price for this product. I understand budget constraints, but I need to ensure I'm receiving fair value. I can come down from my initial offer - I'm willing to sell the product for $22,000, which represents a significant discount from my original price. This product has exceptional quality and features that justify this price point. Would you be able to meet me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
