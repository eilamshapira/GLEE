"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm offering for $25000. This is a fair market price for a product of this caliber. I'm confident you'll find the value matches the price I'm asking. Are you interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $15,000 and also higher than John's guaranteed price of $15,000, there's no reason to accept this offer. While I could try to negotiate with Alice through a counteroffer, I already know that John is willing to sell at my maximum acceptable price. Given that Alice's initial offer is so high, it might take several rounds of negotiation to reach a reasonable price, if at all.

I'll choose to reject and make a counteroffer, as there's a chance we might reach a better deal than John's price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25,000 is well above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $12000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price for this product. I understand budget constraints, but I need to ensure I'm receiving fair value. I can come down from my initial offer - I'm willing to sell the product for $22000, which represents a significant discount from my original price. This product has exceptional quality and features that justify this price point. Would you be able to meet me at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $22,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($15,000) and John's price ($15,000). While Alice did reduce her price by $3,000, she's still far from a price point that would be acceptable to me. Given that we're now in round 3, and Alice's price reduction was relatively small (from $25,000 to $22,000), it seems unlikely that we'll reach a price below $15,000 in the remaining rounds.

At this point, rather than continuing negotiations that might not lead to a suitable price, it would be more practical to take John's guaranteed offer.
