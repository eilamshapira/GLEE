Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is lower than the minimum value of $1,200,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,200,000, I will reject Bob's offer. However, before selling to John, I want to try to negotiate a better price with Bob. So, I will proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

My counteroffer is: $1,800,000

But in the format you requested, my decision for this round is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is higher than the minimum value of $1,200,000 that the product is worth to me, and it's also a significant amount, I will consider it. However, I still want to try to get a better price from Bob.

My decision for this round is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

And I will send a new counteroffer to Bob: {""product_price"": 1600000}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than the minimum value of $1,200,000 that the product is worth to me, I am inclined to accept it. This offer is also higher than my previous counteroffer of $1,600,000, which suggests that Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.

My decision for this round is: {""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
