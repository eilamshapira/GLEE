"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to get a better price. The product is worth about $90 to me, and I know I can get it elsewhere for $120. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to pay $95 for it, which still gives you a good profit margin from your cost of $80.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but considering the exclusivity and quality of the product, I can't go as low as $95. Iâ€™m willing to reduce my initial price, but I believe $110 is a fair value. Let me know your thoughts on this.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still quite high considering the market value. I understand you need to make a profit beyond your $80 cost, and I'm happy to ensure that happens. How about we meet at $100? This gives you a solid $20 profit and saves me a bit compared to my other option.",100.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, considering the quality and exclusivity of the product, how about we settle at $105? I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand you're looking to keep expenses low, so how about we meet at $103? I believe that's a fair compromise considering the quality and value of the product. Let me know if that works for you.",103.0,Alice,5,
