Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to get a better price. The product is worth about $90 to me, and I know I can get it elsewhere for $120. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to pay $95 for it, which still gives you a good profit margin from your cost of $80.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This gives you a solid $20 profit and saves me a bit compared to my other option.
