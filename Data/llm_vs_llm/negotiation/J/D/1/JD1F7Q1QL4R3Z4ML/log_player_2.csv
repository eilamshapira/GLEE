"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a great product for you, and I'm offering it at a competitive price. How about we settle on $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given that my maximum value for the product is $80 and John is willing to sell it at exactly $80, Alice's offer of $120 is too high. It would be reasonable to reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as there might be room for negotiation to get a better price than John's $80.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial $120, but not too low to be insulting. Since I know I can get it for $80 from John, I'll start lower to leave room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $120 is quite high for my budget. Given the market conditions, I would be willing to pay $60 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but I can't go as low as $60. How about we meet halfway at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $100 is still above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). Since I can get the same product from John for $80, there's no reason to accept a price higher than that. I'll reject and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $120 to $100, she's showing willingness to negotiate. However, I need to stay firm knowing I have the $80 alternative from John. I'll make a counteroffer slightly below my maximum value to leave room for potential negotiation.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I've done some market research, and I know I can get this product elsewhere for $80. I'd be willing to pay $70 to buy it from you. Would that work?"", ""product_price"": 70}"
