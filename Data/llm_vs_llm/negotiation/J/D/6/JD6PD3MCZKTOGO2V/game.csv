"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9000. I understand that $12000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. Considering your interest, I'm willing to negotiate. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $9500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $9500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal for the product. Considering your latest offer and the fact that I have another interested buyer at $10000, I'm willing to make a small concession. I can offer the product to you for $10500. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, given the product's value and the other offer on the table. Let me know if this works for you.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position and the other offer you have. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours. How about $10000? This seems like a fair compromise given the circumstances. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Bob,6,
