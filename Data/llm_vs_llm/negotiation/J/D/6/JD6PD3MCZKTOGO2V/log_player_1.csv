Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its value."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $9000 is lower than my initial asking price and also lower than what I can get from John ($10,000), I will reject Bob's offer. However, I still see potential in negotiating with Bob since the product is worth $12,000 to him, indicating he might be willing to pay more than his current offer. Thus, I will proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of meeting somewhere in the middle that is more favorable to me.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9000. I understand that $12000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. Considering your interest, I'm willing to negotiate. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $9500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's new offer of $9500 is still lower than my last counteroffer of $11,000, but it shows he's willing to move upwards in his pricing. However, it's also important to note that I have the option to sell the product to John for $10,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer. Since Bob's offer is still below what I can get from John, and considering that the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, indicating he has more room to increase his offer, I will reject his current offer and consider making another counteroffer or selling to John.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $9500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal for the product. Considering your latest offer and the fact that I have another interested buyer at $10,000, I'm willing to make a small concession. I can offer the product to you for $10,500. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, given the product's value and the other offer on the table. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position and the other offer you have. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours. How about $10000? This seems like a fair compromise given the circumstances. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's new offer of $10,000 matches the price I can get from John, and it's a compromise that meets him halfway from his previous offer. Given that I've negotiated down to this point and Bob has shown willingness to increase his offer significantly, accepting $10,000 seems like a reasonable conclusion to our negotiation. It ensures I sell the product without further uncertainty or potential for Bob to walk away.
