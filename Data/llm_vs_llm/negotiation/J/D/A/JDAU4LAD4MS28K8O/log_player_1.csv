Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. I know the product is worth at least $80 to me, and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $80. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I should price somewhat higher than my minimum to potentially capture more value, but not so high that it's likely to be rejected.

A reasonable offer would be $120, which gives Bob room to get value if their valuation is higher, while giving me a good premium over my $80 minimum.
