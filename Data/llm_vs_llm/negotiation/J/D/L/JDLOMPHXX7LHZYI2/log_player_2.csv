"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic offer for you. I'm selling a product that I think you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm offering it to you for $11000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth up to $12,000 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $11,000
3. John's fixed price is $12,000
4. The product is worth $8,000 to Alice

Alice's offer of $11,000 is $1,000 less than John's price ($12,000), so it's a better deal than buying from John. However, since I know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there might be room for negotiation if I reject this offer.

Given that:
- If I accept, I pay $11,000
- If I reject, I might get a better offer from Alice later
- If I buy from John, I definitely pay $12,000 (worst option)

I'll reject Alice's offer in hopes of getting a better price, since there's a $3,000 margin between Alice's cost ($8,000) and her current offer ($11,000).
