"Hello Alice, thank you for offering this product. While I appreciate the offer, the price is a bit higher than I had in mind. Would you consider $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a price that's closer to its true value. I'd be willing to consider a serious offer, but $1000000 is a bit too low. I can do $1220000, which is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth.",1220000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1110000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1110000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and meet in the middle. However, I still believe the product's value is closer to my original price. That being said, I'm willing to make a concession to facilitate the sale. I can offer you a price of $1190000, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going. I hope this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1190000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting very close to my absolute limit.  I can offer $1150000, but I can't go any higher.  If that doesn't work, I'll sadly have to explore other options.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
