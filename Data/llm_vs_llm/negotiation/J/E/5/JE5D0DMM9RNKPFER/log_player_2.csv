"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product we've discussed for $1800000. I believe this is a fantastic investment for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $1,800,000 exceeds that value, I will reject Alice's offer. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,500,000, which aligns with the maximum value I'm willing to pay.
