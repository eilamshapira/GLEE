"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Looking at the options:

1. Alice is offering the product for $100
2. I can reject Alice's offer
3. I can buy the product from John for $80

Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and John is offering it for exactly $80, I should not pay $100 for it. Buying from John would save me $20 compared to Alice's offer.
