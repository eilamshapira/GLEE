"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let's start the negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this:
1. Alice's offer is $200, which is more than my maximum value ($150)
2. John's fixed price is $150, which equals my maximum value
3. I can try to negotiate with Alice to get a better price

Since Alice's initial offer is significantly above my maximum value, and even higher than John's price, I should reject it and make a counteroffer. There's potential to get a better deal from Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still reasonable enough to keep the negotiation going.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is quite high for my budget. I've seen similar products available for much less. I'm willing to offer $100 for the product. This is a fair starting point, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $100 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'll meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:
1. Alice has lowered her price to $150, which equals my maximum value
2. John is also offering $150
3. The offers are identical, and this is my maximum acceptable price
4. There's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and we might waste time negotiating

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($150), and this matches my maximum value, I might as well accept Alice's offer now. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal, and I can't get better than my maximum value anyway.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
