"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product and Jhon is selling it for that exact price, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice.  You're guaranteed to get the product at your maximum price point."
