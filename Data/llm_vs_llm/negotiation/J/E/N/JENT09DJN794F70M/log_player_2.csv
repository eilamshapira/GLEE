Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and within my budget. Since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, I'll offer a price that is lower than that, but still shows that I'm interested in buying the product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice rejected my previous offer of $700,000 and came back with a price of $1,050,000, I'll try to meet her halfway. I'll increase my offer, but still keep it below my budget of $800,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,025,000 is still above my budget of $800,000. Although she's slowly decreasing the price, it's not decreasing fast enough. I'll reject the offer again and consider my next move. Since I have a better alternative with John's offer of $800,000, I'm not in a hurry to accept a higher price from Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to make a more aggressive counteroffer to see if I can get Alice to lower her price further. Since I know she's willing to sell the product for less than $1,050,000, I'll offer a price that's closer to my budget of $800,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,010,000 is still above my budget of $800,000. At this point, I'm not seeing enough movement in the price to make it worthwhile to continue negotiating. I have a better alternative with John's offer of $800,000, which is a significant savings compared to Alice's current offer.
