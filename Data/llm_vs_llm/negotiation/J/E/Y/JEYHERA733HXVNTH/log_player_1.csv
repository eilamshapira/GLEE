Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider this situation carefully. 

Since the product is worth at least $120 to me, and Bob values it at $100, there's no price point where both Bob and I would benefit from the transaction. If I offer any price below $120, I would be losing value compared to selling to John (who will pay $120).

Additionally, if I offer any price above $100 to Bob, he would reject it since the product is only worth $100 to him.

Given these constraints, my best option is to set a price that ensures I'll end up selling to John for $120.
