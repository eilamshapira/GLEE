"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $9500. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $9,500 is below that threshold, I should consider whether I can get a better deal. However, rejecting Alice's offer means I would have to buy from John for $10,000, which is higher than Alice's offer. Given that Alice's offer is already close to the maximum I'm willing to pay and is less than what John is offering, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer to save $500 compared to buying from John.
