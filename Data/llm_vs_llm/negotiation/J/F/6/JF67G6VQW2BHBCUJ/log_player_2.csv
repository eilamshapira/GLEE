"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since the product is worth $15,000 to me and Alice's offer is $18,000, which is higher than my desired price, I will reject Alice's offer. I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll offer a price that is closer to my desired price of $15,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $16,500 is still higher than my desired price of $15,000, but it's lower than her initial offer of $18,000. Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous offer, but still lower than Alice's current offer. I'll try to meet Alice halfway and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $15,500 is very close to my desired price of $15,000, but it's still slightly higher. However, I also have the option to buy the product from John for $15,000, which is my maximum budget.

In this case, I think it's better to buy the product from John for $15,000, rather than paying $15,500 to Alice. So, I'll choose to buy the product from John.
