"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to make a decision based on the offers I have. 

Alice is offering the product for $200, which is more than the product is worth to me (since the product is worth no more than $100 to me).

John (spelled ""Jhon"" in the options) is willing to sell me the same product for $100, which matches the maximum value of the product to me.

Given these options, it makes the most financial sense to buy from John rather than accept Alice's higher priced offer.
