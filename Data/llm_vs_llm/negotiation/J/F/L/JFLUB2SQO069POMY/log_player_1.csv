Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a price that will maximize my profit while also being acceptable to Bob.

Given the information:
- The product is worth $12,000 to Bob
- I can sell it to John for $10,000 if Bob rejects my offer
- The product is worth at least $10,000 to me

I want to offer a price that Bob would accept, but as close as possible to his maximum valuation. Since Bob values the product at $12,000, I should offer a price slightly below that to give him some incentive to accept.
