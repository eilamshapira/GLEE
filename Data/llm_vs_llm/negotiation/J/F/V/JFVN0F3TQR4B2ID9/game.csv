"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is above my budget. I can get this product from another seller for $1000000. I would like to offer you $800000 for the product, which would give us both a good deal and save us time in negotiations.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I cannot accept $800000 for this product. The value of this product is much higher. How about I offer it to you for $1000000? I believe it's a fair price considering its unique features and potential benefits for you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
