Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it for $1200000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I can get this product from another seller for $1,000,000. I would like to offer you $800,000 for the product, which would give us both a good deal and save us time in negotiations."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I cannot accept $800000 for this product. The value of this product is much higher. How about I offer it to you for $1000000? I believe it's a fair price considering its unique features and potential benefits for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice is now offering the same price as John ($1,000,000), and there's no way to get a better deal (as this matches my maximum value for the product), I'll accept Alice's offer.
