Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my strategy carefully. The product is worth $12,000 to both Bob and me. If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell it to John for $12,000, which means I have a guaranteed minimum of $12,000. Since Bob values the product at exactly $12,000, he would be indifferent to buying it at that price (neither gaining nor losing value).

In this situation, I should offer the product to Bob at exactly $12,000. There's no reason to go lower since I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, and going higher would likely lead to rejection since Bob values it at $12,000.
