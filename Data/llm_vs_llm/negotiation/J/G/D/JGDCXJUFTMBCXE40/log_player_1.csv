"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $3000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer that I believe is more reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $500,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and I believe the product is worth more. I'll try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. 

My counteroffer: $2,000,000. This price still reflects the product's value but shows I'm willing to negotiate."

I understand that $3,000,000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer than your counteroffer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, $2000000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a compromise between your new offer and my previous one. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob. While I appreciate his willingness to compromise, $750,000 is still below my target price. I'll try to meet him halfway again, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.

My counteroffer: $1,750,000. This price is lower than my previous offer but still reflects the product's value and is higher than John's offer, making it a more attractive option for me."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued concessions. However, $1750000 is still above my budget. Considering your last offer and my previous counteroffer, I'd like to propose a price that I believe is more reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is lower than John's offer of $1,500,000, it makes more sense for me to sell the product to John. This ensures I get a higher price for the product, which is my goal. Further negotiation with Bob may not yield a better offer, and I have a guaranteed sale at a higher price with John."
