"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential, $1500000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $900000. I understand budget considerations. However, the product's inherent value and long-term benefits justify a price closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $1300000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1300000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. My maximum budget is $1200000. I can offer $1050000.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the sense that we are not too far apart. While $1050000 is a decent offer, it's still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1200000. This is my final offer. ",1200000.0,Alice,5,
