Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine the optimal price to offer Bob for my product. I want to maximize my profit while ensuring that the product will sell.

I already have a guaranteed buyer, John, who will pay $1,500,000. This is my fallback option and establishes my minimum acceptable price.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I need to set a price that gives me a reasonable chance of making more than my guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. If I price it too high, Bob might reject it, and I'll end up with my fallback amount. If I price it too low, I might leave money on the table.

Given that the product must be worth significantly more than $1,500,000 to Bob for him to consider purchasing it, I'll set a price that gives me a substantial premium over my minimum while still potentially being attractive to Bob.
