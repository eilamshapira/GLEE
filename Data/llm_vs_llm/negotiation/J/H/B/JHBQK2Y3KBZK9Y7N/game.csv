"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  $20000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $10000. Would you consider selling it for that?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $18000.  This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll agree.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value, but $18000 is still more than I'm willing to spend.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $11500?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but this product is top-of-the-line.  Let's split the difference between your offer and my last price. How about $16000?",16000.0,Alice,5,
