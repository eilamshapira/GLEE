"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I believe would be a great opportunity for you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1850000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential value. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me. Alice is offering it for $1,850,000. If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy it from John for $1,200,000. Since $1,200,000 is less than $1,850,000, I should reject Alice's offer and buy from John.
