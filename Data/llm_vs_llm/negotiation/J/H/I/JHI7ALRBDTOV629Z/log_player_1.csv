Send your offer to Bob.,"{
    ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $125. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with the purchase."",
    ""product_price"": 125
}

I chose $125 because:
1. I know the product is worth $120 to me (my minimum)
2. Bob values it at $100
3. I'm confident John will buy it at $120
4. By pricing it above Bob's valuation, I ensure he'll reject it
5. This allows me to sell to John at $120, maximizing my profit
6. Even if Bob surprisingly accepted, I'd still make more than my minimum"
