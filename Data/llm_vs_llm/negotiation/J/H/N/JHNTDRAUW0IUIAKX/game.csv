"Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $12000. This is a competitive price for the value you'll receive. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $12000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $6000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $6000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $8000, but I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I can reduce my initial price to $10000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects the product's true market value. Would this work for you?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the new offer, Alice. I understand your position, but $10000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $7000. Is there any chance we can meet in the middle at this price?",7000.0,Bob,4,
