"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $12,000. This is a competitive price for the value you'll receive. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $12000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $6000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer because $6,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 (which I can get from John), but I still see potential for negotiation with Bob to reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $6,000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $8,000, but I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I can reduce my initial price to $10,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects the product's true market value. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the new offer, Alice. I understand your position, but $10000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $7000. Is there any chance we can meet in the middle at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I choose to sell to John because Bob's offer of $7,000 is still below what John is willing to pay ($8,000), and based on Bob's negotiation pattern, it seems unlikely he will exceed $8,000. Rather than continuing negotiations that might not lead to a better outcome, it's more profitable to take John's guaranteed offer of $8,000."
