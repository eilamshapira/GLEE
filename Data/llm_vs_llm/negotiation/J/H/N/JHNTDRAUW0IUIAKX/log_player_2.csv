Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $12000. This is a competitive price for the value you'll receive. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $6000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $8000, but I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I can reduce my initial price to $10000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects the product's true market value. Would this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Round 4
