"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too low for this product's value. I could sell it to another buyer for $120, but I believe this product would be more valuable to you. I can offer it for $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While I do believe this product would be useful to me, $150 is still a bit too steep. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
