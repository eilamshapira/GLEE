"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. I believe it would be valuable for you, and I'm willing to sell it for $180. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I can always sell to John for $120, so there's no reason to accept such a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too low for this product's value. I could sell it to another buyer for $120, but I believe this product would be more valuable to you. I can offer it for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While I do believe this product would be useful to me, $150 is still a bit too steep. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $120. Bob's offer of $110 is still below what I can get from John ($120), and given Bob's negotiation pattern of making low offers, it seems unlikely we'll reach a price higher than $120. It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John rather than continue negotiating for a potentially lower amount."
