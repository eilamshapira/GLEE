"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $15,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. While I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, I already know that John is willing to sell at $12,000, which matches my maximum value. Therefore, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
