"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $115. It's a fantastic deal and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to analyze the offers to make the best financial decision.

The product is worth up to $120 to me, and I have these options:
1. Accept Alice's offer and pay $115
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John for $120

Since Alice's offer ($115) is less than John's price ($120), and both are within my maximum value threshold, accepting Alice's offer would save me $5.
