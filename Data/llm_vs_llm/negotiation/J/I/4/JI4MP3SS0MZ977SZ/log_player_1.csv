Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider Bob's perspective in this situation. The product is worth $80 to Bob, which is his maximum valuation. If I set the price exactly at $80, Bob might be indifferent between accepting and rejecting my offer. If I set it higher, he will definitely reject it since it would exceed his valuation.

If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell to John for $80. This gives me a guaranteed fallback of $80.

Given this scenario, the optimal offer is exactly $80, as this matches Bob's valuation and my guaranteed alternative.
