"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",80.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $80 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to lower my price to $130. Let me know if this works for you.",130.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 was a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $120? Let me know if this price works for you.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $120 is still a bit above what I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal at this amount.",90.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I see that $120 is still a bit high for you. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is the lowest I can go while still valuing the product appropriately. Let me know if this works for you.",110.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. I can go down to $105, but this is really the lowest I can offer while still feeling it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
