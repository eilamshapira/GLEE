"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find $2.5 million to be significantly above my budget and market expectations. Based on my market research and valuation analysis, I would like to make a counteroffer of $600000. This represents a fair value for the product while considering current market conditions. I look forward to your response.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600000 is significantly below the product's actual value and my minimum acceptable price. This product has proven market demand and exceptional growth potential that justifies a premium valuation. I understand budget considerations, so I'm willing to adjust my price to $1800000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of what you're acquiring. My bottom line is $1000000, as I have another buyer ready at that price, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
