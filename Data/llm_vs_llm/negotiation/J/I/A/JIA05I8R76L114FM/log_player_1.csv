Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find $2.5 million to be significantly above my budget and market expectations. Based on my market research and valuation analysis, I would like to make a counteroffer of $600000. This represents a fair value for the product while considering current market conditions. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600,000 is significantly below the product's actual value and my minimum acceptable price. This product has proven market demand and exceptional growth potential that justifies a premium valuation. I understand budget considerations, so I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,800,000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of what you're acquiring. My bottom line is $1,000,000, as I have another buyer ready at that price, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
