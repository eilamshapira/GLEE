"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to present a unique opportunity to acquire our premium product. This product has exceptional market potential and significant inherent value. I'm offering it to you for $2500000, which represents an excellent investment given its current valuation and future growth prospects. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I will reject Alice's offer of $2,500,000 as it is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000 and even higher than John's guaranteed price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower but still reasonable as a starting point for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find $2.5 million to be significantly above my budget and market expectations. Based on my market research and valuation analysis, I would like to make a counteroffer of $600,000. This represents a fair value for the product while considering current market conditions. I look forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600000 is significantly below the product's actual value and my minimum acceptable price. This product has proven market demand and exceptional growth potential that justifies a premium valuation. I understand budget considerations, so I'm willing to adjust my price to $1800000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of what you're acquiring. My bottom line is $1000000, as I have another buyer ready at that price, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's guaranteed price ($800,000), and Alice has indicated her bottom line is $1,000,000 (which is also above my maximum), it makes the most economic sense to buy from John.
