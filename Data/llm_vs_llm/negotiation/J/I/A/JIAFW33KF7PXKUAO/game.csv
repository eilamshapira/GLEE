"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product to me. While I believe it seems like a good product, $120 seems a little high for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $80, I'm afraid I can't go that low as the product is worth at least that much to me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $100? This is a fair price considering the quality and value of the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
