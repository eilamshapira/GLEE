"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. I'm willing to sell it for $120. This product is well worth the investment and provides excellent value. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice is starting at my absolute highest price.  I need to negotiate to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product to me. While I believe it seems like a good product, $120 seems a little high for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

I am starting with a significantly lower offer to get a sense of what Alice might be willing to accept. It's a common negotiation tactic to start low and give myself room to bargain upwards."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $80, I'm afraid I can't go that low as the product is worth at least that much to me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $100? This is a fair price considering the quality and value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

```

Alice is negotiating, which is a good sign. I'm not in a rush, and John's offer is a safety net.  Let's see if I can get the price down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. Would you be willing to do $90? That would work for me."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

I am moving closer to Alice's price, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This shows I am willing to compromise but also serious about getting a good deal."
