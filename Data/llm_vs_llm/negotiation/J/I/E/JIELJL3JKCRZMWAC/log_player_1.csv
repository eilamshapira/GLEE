Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. Since the product is worth $10,000 to Bob and $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'll start with a high offer to leave room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

{""product_price"": 9,500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob's offer of $8,500 is better than John's fixed price of $8,000
2. This is still early in the negotiation, and since Bob's first counter was $8,500 (coming down from my $9,500), there might be room to negotiate higher
3. Since Bob is willing to pay above my minimum threshold, it's worth continuing negotiation rather than selling to John

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob countered with $8,500 from my initial $9,500 offer, I'll try to meet somewhere in the middle. I'll reduce my price but still maintain room for potential negotiation.

{""product_price"": 9,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Bob has increased his offer from $8,500 to $8,750, showing willingness to negotiate upward
2. The offer is $750 better than John's fixed price of $8,000
3. However, the incremental increases are getting smaller ($250 this time), suggesting we might be approaching Bob's limit
4. There's a risk that if I push too hard, Bob might walk away
5. $8,750 is a reasonable price that gives me a good profit above my minimum of $8,000

Given these factors, I think it's wise to accept this offer. The marginal benefit of continuing negotiation might not be worth the risk of losing this deal.
