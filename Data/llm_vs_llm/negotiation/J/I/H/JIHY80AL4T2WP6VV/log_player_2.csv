"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer ($200) is higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100), I will reject this offer. It's better to either negotiate for a lower price or eventually buy from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

I'll make a counteroffer of $70. This is significantly below John's price of $100, which gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to buying from John. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate upward while maintaining a price advantage over John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $120 because it's still above both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). There's no reason to accept a price higher than John's guaranteed offer of $100. I'll continue negotiating to try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 85}

I'll make a counteroffer of $85. This is a reasonable increase from my previous offer of $70, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying well below John's price of $100. This gives Alice room to make a profit while potentially giving me a better deal than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $100. Since this price matches John's price exactly, there's no advantage to accepting it from Alice right now. I'll try one more time to negotiate a slightly lower price, as we still have rounds remaining. If unsuccessful, I can always fall back to either Alice's $100 or John's $100 offer later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 90}

I'll offer $90, which is slightly below both Alice's and John's price of $100. This gives Alice an incentive to potentially accept while still saving me $10 compared to the alternative options. If Alice rejects this, I might need to consider accepting a $100 offer soon, as we're more than halfway through our negotiation rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $95. This is a good deal because:
1. It's below John's price of $100
2. It's a reasonable compromise from our previous negotiations
3. We're in round 7 of 10, and there's risk in continuing to negotiate
4. We're saving $5 compared to buying from John
5. The price is below my maximum value of $100

It's time to close the deal and secure the $5 savings."
