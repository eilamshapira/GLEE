"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $1500000. To make this deal work between us, I would need a much better price. I can offer you $1200000, which would be advantageous for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1200000 is considerably below its true value and potential. I'm confident you understand the unique nature of what's being offered. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1750000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
