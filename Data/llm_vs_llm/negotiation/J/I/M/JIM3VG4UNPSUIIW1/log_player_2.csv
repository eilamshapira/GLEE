"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to acquire a truly unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2000000. This is a rare opportunity to own something special. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,500,000 (which is also John's price). It would not be rational to accept this offer when I can either negotiate for a lower price or buy from John for $1,500,000. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $1,500,000. To make this deal work between us, I would need a much better price. I can offer you $1,200,000, which would be advantageous for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1200000 is considerably below its true value and potential. I'm confident you understand the unique nature of what's being offered. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1750000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's new offer of $1,750,000 is still above my maximum value of $1,500,000 and above John's price. While Alice has moved down from her initial offer, she's still asking for more than John's price. Since I can get the same product from John for $1,500,000, and Alice seems unlikely to go below this price given her current negotiating position, the most rational decision is to buy from John. This ensures I get the product at a price within my budget without risking further rounds of potentially unsuccessful negotiations."
