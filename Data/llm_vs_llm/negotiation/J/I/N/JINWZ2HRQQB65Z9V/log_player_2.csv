"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $149. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $149. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $149
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and Alice's offer of $149 exceeds that value, I will reject Alice's offer and consider buying from John instead, who is willing to sell it to me for $120, which is within my budget.
