You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's make a counteroffer to Alice. Since my maximum willingness to pay is $800,000, I'll start with a lower offer to have some room for negotiation.

Counteroffer: $500,000"
