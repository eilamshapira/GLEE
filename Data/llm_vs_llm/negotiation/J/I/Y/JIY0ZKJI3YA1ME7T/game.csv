"Hi Alice! Thanks for your offer, but $150 is too high for me. I know the product is worth a lot to you, but I can actually get it from another seller for $80. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider selling it for $70? This way, we can both benefit from the deal.",70.0,Bob,2,
