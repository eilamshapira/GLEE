"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! Thanks for your offer, but $150 is too high for me. I know the product is worth a lot to you, but I can actually get it from another seller for $80. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider selling it for $70? This way, we can both benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
