"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential value.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is significantly above what I'm looking to spend. I know I can get this product from another seller for $10000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product. This gives you a quicker sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is below my minimum acceptable price. I understand you have other options at $10000, and I also have a standing offer at that price. However, I believe my product offers superior value. I can come down to $12000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you reducing your price, but $12000 is still more than what I can get from John at $10000. Since the product is worth $10000 to you as well, there's little incentive for me to pay above that price. I can offer you $9000, which gives you a quick sale and still provides you with a reasonable return. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $10000, I'll need to go with John's offer instead.",9000.0,Bob,4,
