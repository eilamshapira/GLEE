Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential value."", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is significantly above what I'm looking to spend. I know I can get this product from another seller for $10000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product. This gives you a quicker sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $8,500 since it's below even what John is willing to pay ($10,000), and it's below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I will make a new counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is below my minimum acceptable price. I understand you have other options at $10,000, and I also have a standing offer at that price. However, I believe my product offers superior value. I can come down to $12,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you reducing your price, but $12000 is still more than what I can get from John at $10000. Since the product is worth $10000 to you as well, there's little incentive for me to pay above that price. I can offer you $9000, which gives you a quick sale and still provides you with a reasonable return. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $10000, I'll need to go with John's offer instead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob is unwilling to pay more than $10,000 and his current offer is $9,000 (which is below John's guaranteed offer of $10,000), it makes the most financial sense to sell to John. Bob has made it clear he won't pay above $10,000, so continuing negotiations would be futile, and accepting less than John's offer would be leaving money on the table."
