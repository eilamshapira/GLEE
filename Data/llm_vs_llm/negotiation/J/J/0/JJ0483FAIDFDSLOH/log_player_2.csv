"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's offer of $15,000 is higher than the product's worth to me (which is no more than $10,000) and also higher than John's price of $10,000. There's no reason for me to accept this offer when I can get the same product for $10,000 from John.

I know I can get this product from another seller for $10,000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is below my minimum acceptable price. I understand you have other options at $10000, and I also have a standing offer at that price. However, I believe my product offers superior value. I can come down to $12000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's counteroffer of $12,000 is still higher than John's price of $10,000, and it's also higher than the product's worth to me (no more than $10,000). There's no reason for me to accept this when I can get the same product for less from John.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you reducing your price, but $12,000 is still more than what I can get from John at $10,000. Since the product is worth $10,000 to you as well, there's little incentive for me to pay above that price. I can offer you $9,000, which gives you a quick sale and still provides you with a reasonable return. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $10,000, I'll need to go with John's offer instead."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
