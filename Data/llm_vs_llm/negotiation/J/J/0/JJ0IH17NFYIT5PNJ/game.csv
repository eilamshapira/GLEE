"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product. Let me know if that works for you!",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! $60 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $100?  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $100 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $70? That's the highest I can go while staying within my budget. Let me know what you think!",70.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, $70 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we split the difference and go with $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,5,
