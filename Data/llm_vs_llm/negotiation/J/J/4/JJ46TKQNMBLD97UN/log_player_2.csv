"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12000. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with the purchase! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'll analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $12,000
2. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
3. John is offering the same product for $10,000

Since Alice's offer ($12,000) is higher than both:
- The maximum value I place on the product ($10,000)
- John's guaranteed offer ($10,000)

It would be unwise to accept Alice's offer. I could reject and make a counteroffer, but since John's price is already at my maximum value, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice. The best decision is to buy from John.
