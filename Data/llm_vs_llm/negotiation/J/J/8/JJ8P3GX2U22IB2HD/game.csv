"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $250 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. Given that I can get a similar product elsewhere for $150, I would like to offer $120 for your product. This allows you to make a sale while giving me a reasonable price.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but $120 is too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $220?",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $220 is still significantly above my budget and above what I can get elsewhere. Given that I can purchase this product for $150 from another seller, I can offer you $135. This gives you a quick sale while saving me some money.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. $135 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $180?",180.0,Alice,5,
