"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but my budget is quite tight. I am willing to offer $5000 for it. Would you consider this price?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $5000 is significantly below the product's value. Given the quality and market conditions, I cannot go below $15000. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the value you're placing on this product, Alice. However, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle a bit more? I can go up to $6500. Would that be acceptable for you?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your attempt to find middle ground, but $6500 is still too low for this product. I've carefully considered your budget constraints, and I can offer you $13000, which is a substantial reduction from my previous offers. This is really the best price I can offer while still maintaining the product's fair value.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you, Alice, for your patience and willingness to negotiate. I truly value the product you're offering but must remain within my means. The highest I can offer is $7500. I hope we can agree at this price, as I am eager to close the deal.",7500.0,Bob,6,
