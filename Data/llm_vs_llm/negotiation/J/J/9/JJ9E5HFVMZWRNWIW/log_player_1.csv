"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18,500. This is a competitive price for the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 18500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but my budget is quite tight. I am willing to offer $5000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll proceed with a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $5,000 is far too low, as it's even below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Since we still have several rounds for negotiation, I'll continue to work towards finding a more favorable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $5,000 is significantly below the product's value. Given the quality and market conditions, I cannot go below $15,000. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value you're placing on this product, Alice. However, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle a bit more? I can go up to $6500. Would that be acceptable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $6,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and since he's only increasing his offers by small amounts, it seems unlikely we'll reach a satisfactory price point. However, I'll make one more attempt with a lower counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap before considering John's guaranteed offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your attempt to find middle ground, but $6,500 is still too low for this product. I've carefully considered your budget constraints, and I can offer you $13,000, which is a substantial reduction from my previous offers. This is really the best price I can offer while still maintaining the product's fair value."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you, Alice, for your patience and willingness to negotiate. I truly value the product you're offering but must remain within my means. The highest I can offer is $7500. I hope we can agree at this price, as I am eager to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've decided to sell to John for $10,000. After several rounds of negotiation, Bob's offers have only increased incrementally and remain well below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. His latest offer of $7,500 and the pattern of small increases suggest we're unlikely to reach a price above $10,000 in the remaining rounds. John's guaranteed offer of $10,000 is the more prudent choice at this point."
