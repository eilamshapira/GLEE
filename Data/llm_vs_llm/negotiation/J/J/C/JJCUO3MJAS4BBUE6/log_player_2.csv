"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1350000. This is a significant price reduction, and it gives you a great chance to acquire this valuable product for less than its true worth. I understand this is a substantial investment, but I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer willing to pay the full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
