"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider the options carefully. Alice is offering the product for $120, which is lower than the $150 price from John. Since the product is worth up to $150 to me, this is already a good deal that saves me $30.

I could try to negotiate for an even lower price, but there's always a risk that we might not reach an agreement in the end. Since Alice's initial offer is already below my maximum value, it makes sense to accept it.
