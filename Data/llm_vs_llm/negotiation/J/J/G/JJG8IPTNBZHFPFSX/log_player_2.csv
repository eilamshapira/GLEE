"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is much higher than both the maximum amount the product is worth to me ($800,000) and the price at which John is willing to sell ($800,000), it would not make financial sense to accept Alice's current offer.

I could reject and make a counteroffer, but since John is already offering the product at exactly the maximum value it's worth to me, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice unless I believe she would accept a price significantly lower than $800,000.
