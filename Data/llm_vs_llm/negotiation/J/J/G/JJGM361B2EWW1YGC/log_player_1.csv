Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider this carefully. 

I know that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, so he won't pay more than that. But the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I have John willing to pay exactly $1,500,000.

Since Bob's maximum value ($1,000,000) is less than my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000) and less than my alternative option with John ($1,500,000), there's no possible deal with Bob that would benefit me more than selling to John.

Therefore, I should offer a price that Bob will reject, allowing me to sell to John instead.
