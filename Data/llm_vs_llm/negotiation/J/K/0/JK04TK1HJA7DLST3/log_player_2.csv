"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this exclusive product for a one-time price of $150. Let me know if you'd like to take advantage of this offer! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","In this situation, Alice is offering the product for $150, which is exactly the same price as John's offer. Since both prices are equal and at my maximum value of $150, I have no advantage in choosing one over the other. I might as well accept Alice's offer since she's already engaged in the negotiation.
