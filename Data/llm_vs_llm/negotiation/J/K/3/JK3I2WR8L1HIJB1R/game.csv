"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I believe the product could be a great fit for me at a lower price point. I'm willing to offer $1100000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and offer. While I appreciate your proposal, I need to point out that your offer of $1100000 is actually below my minimum acceptable price. The product has a minimum value of $1200000 to me, and I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay that amount. However, I believe this product would be more valuable to you at $1500000, so I'm willing to meet you part way. I can offer you the product for $1350000, which gives you a substantial value of $150000 while allowing me a reasonable return. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents a win-win scenario for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position and appreciate the reduction in price. However, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1200000. This is the highest I can go while still making the investment worthwhile for me. Let me know if this works for you.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for raising your offer to $1200000. I recognize your effort to reach a middle ground, and I appreciate that. While this matches what I could get from selling to John, I believe there's still room for us to find a more mutually beneficial arrangement given the product's value to you is $1500000. I'm willing to come down significantly from my previous offer to $1280000. This gives you a substantial value of $220000 while providing me with just a bit more than my minimum threshold. This seems like a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. Would you be able to meet me at this price?",1280000.0,Alice,5,
