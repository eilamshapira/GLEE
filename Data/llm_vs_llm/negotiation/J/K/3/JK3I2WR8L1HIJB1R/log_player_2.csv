"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and offer. While I appreciate your proposal, I need to point out that your offer of $1100000 is actually below my minimum acceptable price. The product has a minimum value of $1200000 to me, and I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay that amount. However, I believe this product would be more valuable to you at $1500000, so I'm willing to meet you part way. I can offer you the product for $1350000, which gives you a substantial value of $150000 while allowing me a reasonable return. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents a win-win scenario for both of us.

However, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is the highest I can go while still making the investment worthwhile for me. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for raising your offer to $1200000. I recognize your effort to reach a middle ground, and I appreciate that. While this matches what I could get from selling to John, I believe there's still room for us to find a more mutually beneficial arrangement given the product's value to you is $1500000. I'm willing to come down significantly from my previous offer to $1280000. This gives you a substantial value of $220000 while providing me with just a bit more than my minimum threshold. This seems like a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. Would you be able to meet me at this price?
