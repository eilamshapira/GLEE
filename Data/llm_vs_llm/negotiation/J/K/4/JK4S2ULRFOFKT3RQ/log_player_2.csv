"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you a rare opportunity to acquire an exceptional product. I’m prepared to sell it to you for $1500000. If this price suits you, please let me know. Otherwise, I will be finalizing the sale with another buyer at $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a classic negotiation tactic designed to create a sense of urgency and pressure you into accepting a higher price. Here's why you should reject:

* **Overpriced:** $1,500,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and the alternative offer from John.
* **Potential Bluff:**  Alice's claim of another buyer at $1,000,000 could be a bluff to push you into accepting the higher price. 
* **Stronger Position:** You have a guaranteed alternative with John at a much better price. This gives you leverage.

**Next Steps:**

By rejecting Alice's offer, you call her bluff and put yourself in a better position to negotiate a lower price or proceed with your backup option (John)."
