You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since the offered price of $160 is higher than my maximum budget of $150, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice. Since I want to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a relatively low price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $145 is closer to my budget, but still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Since it's only $5 less than John's price of $150, I'll consider making another counteroffer to see if Alice can go any lower.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to meet Alice halfway between my previous offer and her new offer. My previous offer was $120, and her new offer is $145, so I'll make a counteroffer of $132.50. However, to make the negotiation simpler, I'll round it down to $130, hoping Alice will be willing to accept it or at least make another concession.
