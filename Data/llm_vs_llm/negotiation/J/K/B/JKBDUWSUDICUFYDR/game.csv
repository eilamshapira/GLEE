"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $15000 is the maximum I'd be willing to pay, and I can get it from another seller at that same price. For me to choose your product over theirs, I'd need a better deal. I'm prepared to offer $11500, which I believe is fair given market conditions. Would you be able to work with this price?",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I appreciate your perspective. However, I believe the product's value is higher than your offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and set the price at $13250. This way, we both make a compromise. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,3,
