Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional quality and the value it can bring to you, I'm confident that it's worth $15,000. I'm eager to hear your thoughts on this price."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $15000 is the maximum I'd be willing to pay, and I can get it from another seller at that same price. For me to choose your product over theirs, I'd need a better deal. I'm prepared to offer $11500, which I believe is fair given market conditions. Would you be able to work with this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I believe there's still room for negotiation. While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I think we can find a mutually beneficial price point. I'm not ready to accept his offer or sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I appreciate your perspective. However, I believe the product's value is higher than your offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and set the price at $13,250. This way, we both make a compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13250}"
