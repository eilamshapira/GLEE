"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional quality and the value it can bring to you, I'm confident that it's worth $15000. I'm eager to hear your thoughts on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","After considering Alice's offer of $15,000, I notice that this is exactly the same price that John is offering, and it's also the maximum amount the product is worth to me. There's no advantage in accepting Alice's current offer over buying from John, and there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice.

While I appreciate the quality of your product, $15,000 is the maximum I'd be willing to pay, and I can get it from another seller at that same price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I appreciate your perspective. However, I believe the product's value is higher than your offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and set the price at $13250. This way, we both make a compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down to $13,250, which is less than the $15,000 John is offering and the maximum value to me. This is a good sign that she's willing to negotiate and has already moved substantially from her initial price.
