"Hi Bob, I'm offering my premium product to you for $18000. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that you have budget constraints, but I'm afraid $8000 is too low for me to accept. However, I'm willing to come down from my initial price. Would you be able to meet me halfway at $14000? This way, we can both find some common ground.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer and for being willing to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price. However, $14000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000, which is the highest I'm willing to pay. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
