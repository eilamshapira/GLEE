Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
