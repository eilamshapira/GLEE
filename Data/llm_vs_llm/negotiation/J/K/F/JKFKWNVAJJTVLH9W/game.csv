"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but the product's value justifies a higher price. How about we settle at $1100000? This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering I have other options available to me at $1000000, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
