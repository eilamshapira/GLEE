"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to me and Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 exceeds that value, it doesn't make sense to accept the offer as it is. Additionally, buying from John for $1,000,000 is an option, but I'd like to try and negotiate a better price with Alice first. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer but still shows that I'm interested in the product. Since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, I'll start by offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's offer to leave room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but the product's value justifies a higher price. How about we settle at $1100000? This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has made a counteroffer of $1,100,000, which is still above the value I place on the product ($1,000,000). While it's a better offer than the initial $1,200,000, it's still not within my desired budget. Since buying from John for $1,000,000 is an option that matches the value I place on the product, I don't see a compelling reason to accept Alice's higher offer. However, I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price.

Given that Alice's offer is closer to my target but still too high, and considering I have the option to buy from John at my target price, I'll reject Alice's current offer and consider making another counteroffer or buying from John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $1,100,000 and I know that I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is closer to my target price but still shows willingness to negotiate. I'll split the difference between Alice's last offer and my target price to demonstrate my seriousness about purchasing the product while also trying to save as much money as possible.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering I have other options available to me at $1,000,000, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
