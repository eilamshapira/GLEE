Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. Given its quality and rarity, I'm asking $25,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product sounds interesting, $25000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $10000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
