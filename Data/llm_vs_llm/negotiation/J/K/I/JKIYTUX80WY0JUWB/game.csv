"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. Given its quality and utility, I'm offering it to you for $95. This represents a fair price considering the $100 value you would get from it.",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $95 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $85 is closer to what I'm looking for, I need to get at least $90 for this product given its quality and value to you. This still gives you a $10 benefit, which I think is quite fair. Would you agree to $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $88.  How about we split the difference?",88.0,Bob,4,
