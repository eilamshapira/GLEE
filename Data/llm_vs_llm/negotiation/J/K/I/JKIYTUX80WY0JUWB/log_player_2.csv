"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. Given its quality and utility, I'm offering it to you for $95. This represents a fair price considering the $100 value you would get from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to try and negotiate a lower price.  $95 is too close to what I'd pay from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $95 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $85 is closer to what I'm looking for, I need to get at least $90 for this product given its quality and value to you. This still gives you a $10 benefit, which I think is quite fair. Would you agree to $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not happy with that price, but I'm going to see if I can get Alice to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $88.  How about we split the difference?"", ""product_price"": 88}
