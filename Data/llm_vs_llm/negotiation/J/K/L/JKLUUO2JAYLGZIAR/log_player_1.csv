"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $140. It's a great value and I think you'll be very happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I understand that $140 might be too high, but $110 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle, how about $125?"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that $140 might be too high, but $110 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle, how about $125? This is a fair price for both of us."",""product_price"": 125}"
