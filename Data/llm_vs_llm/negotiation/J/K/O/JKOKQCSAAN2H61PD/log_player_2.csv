"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $180. It's a great deal considering its value and quality. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","The product is worth no more than $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $180. This is much higher than my valuation. I'd rather buy from John for $80 than pay $180 to Alice.
