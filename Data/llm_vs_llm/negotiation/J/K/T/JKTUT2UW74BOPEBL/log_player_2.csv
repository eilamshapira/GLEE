"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This price ($12,000) is well above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative offer ($8,000). It would be irrational to accept this offer when I have a better alternative. I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 7000}

I'll offer $7,000 because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $8,000
2. It's below John's price of $8,000
3. Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, this still gives her room to negotiate upward while potentially allowing me to get a better deal than John's offer
4. If Alice rejects this, I can still go with John's offer of $8,000 as my backup plan"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John because:
1. Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above my maximum value ($8,000)
2. John's offer of $8,000 is exactly at my maximum value
3. Given that Alice has only moved down to $10,000 from $12,000 after my counteroffer, and this is equal to her cost, it's unlikely she'll go below $8,000
4. Continuing to negotiate might waste time without achieving a better outcome
5. John's offer is a guaranteed solution at my maximum acceptable price"
