"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $200 is above my maximum value of $150, so I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round. Since I can always buy from John for $150, there's no reason to accept any price higher than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 100}

I'll offer $100. This gives room for negotiation while still being significantly below John's price of $150. If Alice rejects this, we can potentially meet somewhere in the middle, but I won't go above $150 since that's my maximum value and John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer since it's still above John's price of $150. There's no reason for me to pay $175 when I can get the same product from John for $150. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 125}

I'll offer $125. This is above my initial offer but still comfortably below John's price of $150. This shows I'm willing to negotiate up from my initial offer while still trying to save money compared to John's price. If Alice rejects this, I still have the option to either negotiate further or go with John's offer of $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice is still offering prices above $150 (now $170) and hasn't shown significant movement toward meeting my price point, I'll choose to buy from John for $150. There's no reason to continue negotiating when Alice's offers remain consistently above my maximum value and John's guaranteed price. This is the most rational economic decision as it gives me the product at the best available price."
