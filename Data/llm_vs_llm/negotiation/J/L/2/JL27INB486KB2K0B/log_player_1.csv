Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my offer to Bob. The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I have John as a guaranteed buyer at that price if Bob declines. This gives me a solid BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement).

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll set a price that gives me room for profit above my minimum acceptable amount while still being potentially attractive to serious buyers.
