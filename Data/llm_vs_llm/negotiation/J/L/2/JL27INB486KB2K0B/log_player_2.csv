"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Based on the information provided, I'll analyze the best decision:

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me (Bob).
Alice is offering to sell it for $2,300,000, which exceeds my maximum valuation.
John is offering the same product for $800,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's price ($2,300,000) is significantly higher than both my valuation and John's alternative offer, the most rational choice is to buy from John.
