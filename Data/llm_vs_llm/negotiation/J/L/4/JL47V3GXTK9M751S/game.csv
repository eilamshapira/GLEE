"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I appreciate your response. While $60 is quite low, how about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell the product for $100. Let me know if that works for you!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for your new proposal. $100 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make another offer - I'm willing to pay $70 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! Thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $70 is still below my minimum price. How about I offer you the product for $90? I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,5,
