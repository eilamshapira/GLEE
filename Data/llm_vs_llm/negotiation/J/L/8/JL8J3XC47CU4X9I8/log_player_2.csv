"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to be careful here. Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than the value I place on the product (which is at most $100) and higher than John's guaranteed price of $100.

There's no reason for me to accept Alice's initial offer of $180 since I can always buy from John for $100. I should reject and make a counteroffer.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has reduced her price from $180 to $160, but this is still well above John's price of $100. Since the product is only worth up to $100 to me, and John is offering exactly $100, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer. I'll reject and make another counteroffer.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's offer has decreased to $150, but it's still higher than John's price of $100. Since I value the product at no more than $100, I have no reason to pay more than that. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.
