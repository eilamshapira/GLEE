"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product and I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start by making a high offer. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially settle on a higher price than if I started with a lower offer.

{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $800,000 is the minimum value I have for the product, and I also have the option to sell it to John for the same price, I don't see a benefit in accepting Bob's offer at this point without trying to negotiate a better price. However, selling to John or accepting Bob's offer guarantees me at least $800,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.

Given that I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and the potential to earn more than $800,000, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to negotiate a higher price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I rejected it to negotiate further, my next step is to make a counteroffer that is reasonable but still higher than $800,000. Considering I initially offered $1,200,000 and Bob countered with $800,000, a significant gap exists. To bridge this gap and encourage further negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial offer but still reflects the product's value to me.
