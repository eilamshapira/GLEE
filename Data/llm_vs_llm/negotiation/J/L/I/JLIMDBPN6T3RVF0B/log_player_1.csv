Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider a reasonable offer for Bob that will maximize my earnings. I know the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price as a fallback.

Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'll need to set a price that has a good chance of being accepted while also being higher than my fallback option.

I'll offer a price that's moderately higher than my minimum acceptable value:

{""product_price"": 19500}"
