Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my options carefully. I know that I can sell the product to John for $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable value for the product. Bob values the product at $8,000, so any price above that would be rejected by him. 

I'll start with an offer that's somewhat above Bob's valuation but not so high that negotiation becomes impossible. If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
