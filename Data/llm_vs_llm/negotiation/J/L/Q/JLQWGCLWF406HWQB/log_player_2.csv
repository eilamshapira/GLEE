"Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $300 is way too high, especially since I value the product at no more than $150 and can buy it from John for exactly $150. It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer to Alice to see if we can negotiate a better price than John's $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 100}

I'll offer $100, which is significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer of $300 and John's price of $150. This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to save money compared to buying from John. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate upward, or I always have the option to go to John's fixed price of $150."
