"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll analyze the situation:

- The product is worth up to $1,200,000 to me (my maximum value)
- Alice's cost is $800,000 (her minimum acceptable price)
- Alice has offered to sell at $1,100,000
- I can buy from John at $1,200,000 as a backup option

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is better than John's price of $1,200,000, but I can likely negotiate a better deal with Alice. There's room between her cost ($800,000) and her current offer ($1,100,000) to find a lower price that still works for both of us.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll analyze the updated situation:

- Alice has reduced her price from $1,100,000 to $1,000,000
- This is a $100,000 improvement over her initial offer
- There's still likely room to negotiate as Alice's cost is $800,000
- The current offer is already $200,000 better than John's price

Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by lowering her price significantly. While I could try to push for an even lower price with another counteroffer, the current offer of $1,000,000 is quite reasonable - it's $200,000 below my maximum value and $200,000 above Alice's cost, which is a fair split of the surplus. Further negotiation could risk souring the deal.
