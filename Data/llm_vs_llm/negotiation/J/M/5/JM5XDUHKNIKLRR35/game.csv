"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'd like to start with this offer.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the market value doesn't fully capture the unique benefits this product offers, especially for your specific needs. While I appreciate your initial offer, I'm afraid $1000000 is lower than I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1100000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet in the middle. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer, but I'm still a bit apart from your valuation. I understand your perspective, and I truly value your interest. Let's try this: $1075000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a worthwhile investment considering the advantages this product will bring to you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
