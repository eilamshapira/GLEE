"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2000000. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm open to negotiations if you're interested.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. Given my valuation, I'd be comfortable offering $750000. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $750000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's value, I'd be willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I can offer it to you for $1375000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. $1375000 is still higher than I can justify. My maximum budget is $1000000, which is what John is offering it for. To keep this negotiation going, I can offer you $900000. Let me know.",900000.0,Bob,4,
