Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm open to negotiations if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. Given my valuation, I'd be comfortable offering $750000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $750,000 is below the value I can get from John ($1,000,000), and I believe the product is worth more, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $750,000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's value, I'd be willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I can offer it to you for $1,375,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 1375000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. $1375000 is still higher than I can justify. My maximum budget is $1000000, which is what John is offering it for. To keep this negotiation going, I can offer you $900000. Let me know. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below what John is willing to pay ($1,000,000), and Bob has mentioned that his maximum budget is $1,000,000, it seems unlikely that he will go above that. Given this information, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John for the higher price of $1,000,000."
