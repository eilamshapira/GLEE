"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,000,000, I will reject her offer. I still want to explore the possibility of buying the product from Alice at a lower price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm not sure what Alice's bottom line is, I'll start with a low anchor.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,700,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. Since she rejected my previous counteroffer of $500,000, I'll try to meet her halfway and make another counteroffer.

However, before doing that, I'll consider my options. Accepting her offer is not feasible, and buying from John is still an option. But I'd like to try to negotiate with Alice a bit more.

I'll reject her offer again and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's previous offer was $1,700,000 and my previous counteroffer was $500,000, I'll try to make a more reasonable counteroffer that's closer to the middle ground. I'll increase my offer by $250,000 to show that I'm willing to negotiate.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,600,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. However, I notice that she's gradually decreasing her price, which suggests that she's willing to negotiate.

At this point, I'm not willing to accept her offer, but I'm also not ready to give up on the negotiation. Buying from John for $1,000,000 is still an option, but I'd like to try to get a better deal from Alice.

I'll reject her offer again and proceed to the next round.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's previous offer was $1,600,000 and my previous counteroffer was $750,000, I'll try to make a more aggressive counteroffer to see if I can get her to move closer to my target price. I'll increase my offer by $150,000 to $900,000, which is still below my maximum budget of $1,000,000.

{""product_price"": $900,000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,500,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. At this point, I'm starting to think that she may not be willing to go as low as I'd like.

However, I notice that she's still decreasing her price, albeit slowly. I'm not willing to accept her current offer, but I'm also not ready to give up on the negotiation just yet.

Before making my next decision, I'll consider my options. Buying from John for $1,000,000 is looking more and more attractive, but I'll try to make one more counteroffer to see if I can get Alice to move closer to my target price.

I'll reject her offer again and proceed to the next round.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's previous offer was $1,500,000 and my previous counteroffer was $900,000, I'll try to make a more reasonable counteroffer that's closer to my maximum budget. I'll increase my offer by $50,000 to $950,000, which is still below my maximum budget of $1,000,000.

This is a relatively small increase, and I'm hoping that Alice will see that I'm willing to meet her halfway. If she rejects this offer, I'll likely consider buying from John for $1,000,000.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,400,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. At this point, I'm starting to think that she's not willing to go low enough to meet my budget.

I've made several counteroffers, and while Alice has been decreasing her price, it's not decreasing quickly enough. I'm getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I need to decide whether to accept a higher price or walk away.

Buying from John for $1,000,000 is looking more and more attractive. I think it's time to consider this option seriously, as it's within my budget and I won't have to continue negotiating.

I'll reject Alice's offer again, but I'm not sure if I'll make another counteroffer. I might consider buying from John instead.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","This is the final round, and I need to make a decision. Since Alice's previous offer was $1,400,000 and my previous counteroffer was $950,000, I'll try to make a final counteroffer that's closer to my maximum budget.

I'll increase my offer to $980,000, which is still below my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This is my final attempt to negotiate with Alice, and if she rejects this offer, I'll likely buy the product from John for $1,000,000.
