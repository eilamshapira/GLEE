Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic offer to Bob that maximizes my profit while still giving him a reason to accept.

Since the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, and I have a guaranteed backup option to sell to John for $800,000, I should ask for a price above $800,000 but not so high that Bob will immediately reject it.

{""product_price"": $825,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since Bob's offer of $775,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 (which I can get from John), and I still have room to negotiate with Bob."
