"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $18000. This is a competitive price, but I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is much higher than what I was expecting to pay for this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $8000. This is a fair price that reflects the current market value. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is unfortunately far below my minimum asking price. I am willing to negotiate further, but I need to be compensated fairly for the value of this product. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $13000? ",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $8000 is simply not enough. Let's compromise: I'm willing to drop my price to $13000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it allows both of us to get what we need. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $13000 is still significantly above what I can justify spending. I've done extensive market research, and similar products are available for much less. I can increase my offer to $9000, which I believe is a fair price that better reflects the market value. Remember, I need to make sure this purchase makes financial sense for my needs.",9000.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value, but I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to go lower, but I need to at least get $10000 for this.  I'm confident the value of the product will justify this price in the long run for you.  Let's try to bridge the gap - how about $10000?",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've considered your offer, and I'm willing to come down to $10000. This is a fair price considering the value and potential of the product. It's a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
