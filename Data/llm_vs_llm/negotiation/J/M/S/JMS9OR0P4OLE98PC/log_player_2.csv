"Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Based on the information provided, I'll analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $17,500
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John for $8,000

Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and John is offering to sell it for exactly $8,000, Alice's offer of $17,500 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation and my alternative option.

The rational decision is to buy from John instead of accepting Alice's much higher price.
