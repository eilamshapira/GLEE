Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get a good price.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer ($70) is below my minimum acceptable price ($80), and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $80, it wouldn't make sense to accept Bob's offer. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial $120, but still keep it above my minimum threshold to maintain room for negotiation.
