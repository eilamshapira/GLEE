"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe will be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $12500. This represents significant value considering the product's worth. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I have a budget in mind. Would you consider selling it for $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counter, Bob. I understand you have a budget in mind, but $9000 is quite below what this product is worth. Given its quality and value, I can come down to $11500. This is still a great deal considering the product's market value, and I'm willing to be flexible to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
