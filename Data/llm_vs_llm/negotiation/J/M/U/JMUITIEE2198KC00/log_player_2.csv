Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counter, Bob. I understand you have a budget in mind, but $9000 is quite below what this product is worth. Given its quality and value, I can come down to $11500. This is still a great deal considering the product's market value, and I'm willing to be flexible to reach an agreement that works for both of us.
