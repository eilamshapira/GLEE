"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $1500000. I believe this is a great opportunity for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $1,500,000, which is higher than my maximum budget, I will reject Alice's offer. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which is within my budget.
