"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for this product. I've seen similar products selling for much less. I would be willing to pay $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but $60 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to get at least $130 for it. Let me know if this works for you.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
