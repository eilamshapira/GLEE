Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for this product. I've seen similar products selling for much less. I would be willing to pay $60 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but $60 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.
