"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than my maximum value ($80) and higher than John's price ($80). It would be better to either negotiate with Alice for a lower price or buy from John. Since we have the option to negotiate, let's try to get a better deal from Alice first by rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for this product. I've seen similar products selling for much less. I would be willing to pay $60 for it."", ""product_price"": 60}

Reasoning: I'm starting with a lower counteroffer of $60 because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $80
2. It leaves room for negotiation to move up if needed
3. If Alice rejects this, I can still increase my offer while staying under my $80 limit
4. I always have the option to go to John for $80 if negotiations with Alice don't work out
5. Starting low gives me the best chance of getting a good deal while maintaining bargaining power"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but $60 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to get at least $130 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Reasoning: At this point, it's clear that Alice's valuation of the product is significantly higher than my maximum value of $80. Even though she reduced her price from $150 to $130, she explicitly stated she needs ""at least $130"" for it. This indicates that further negotiations are unlikely to bring the price down below $80, which is my maximum value and also John's offering price. Since:

1. Alice's current offer ($130) is still way above my maximum value ($80)
2. Alice indicated she won't go below $130
3. John is offering a guaranteed price of $80 (which matches my maximum value)

It's best to end negotiations with Alice and take John's offer rather than waste more time negotiating when Alice's minimum price is well above my maximum value."
