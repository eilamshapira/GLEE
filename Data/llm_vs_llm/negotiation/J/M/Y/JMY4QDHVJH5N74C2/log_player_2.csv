"Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $135
* **My maximum:** $150
* **My goal:** Save as much money as possible.

While Alice's offer is within my budget, it's not the best deal I can potentially get. I have room to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $130
* **My maximum:** $150
* **My goal:** Save as much money as possible.

While I'd like to keep negotiating, Alice is getting closer to my maximum price.  Accepting her offer at $130 saves me $20 compared to buying from John.  The potential savings from further negotiation may not outweigh the risk of losing the deal."
