"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to make a decision based on the offers available to me.

Alice is offering the product for $150, which is the same as what it is worth to her. However, this is more than the $100 maximum value I place on the product.

John (or Jhon as mentioned in the options) is offering the same product for $100, which matches exactly the maximum I'm willing to pay.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, the logical choice is to buy from John at $100 rather than accept Alice's higher price of $150.
