"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
2. Alice's current offer is $12,000
3. The product is worth $8,000 to Alice
4. I can still negotiate with Alice

Alice's offer of $12,000 is better than John's $15,000, but since I know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation to get a better price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice and she offered $12,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's above her cost but significantly below her initial offer. I'll offer $9,500, which gives Alice a reasonable profit margin while being much better for me than both her initial offer and John's price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price significantly from $12,000 to $10,500, which is a good movement in the negotiation. While there might still be some room for negotiation, this is actually a pretty good offer considering:

1. It's $4,500 less than John's price of $15,000
2. It gives Alice a reasonable profit ($2,500 above her cost of $8,000)
3. The risk of pushing too hard might make Alice less willing to negotiate further
4. We've already seen good faith movement from Alice (dropped from $12,000 to $10,500)

Given this analysis, I'll accept this offer as it represents a good balance between getting a good deal and not risking losing the progress we've made.
