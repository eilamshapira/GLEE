"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","The offer from Alice is $180, which is above the $120 the product is worth to me. Additionally, John is offering the same product for exactly $120, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's price is well above my limit and there's already a guaranteed option to buy at my maximum price, the rational choice is to buy from John.
