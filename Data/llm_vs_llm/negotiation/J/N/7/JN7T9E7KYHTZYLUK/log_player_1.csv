Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll analyze the situation:

1) I have a product worth at least $15,000 to me
2) Bob's valuation is unknown
3) If Bob rejects, I can definitely sell to John for $15,000
4) I need to maximize my earnings

Since I have a guaranteed fallback of $15,000 from John, I should price above this amount when offering to Bob. I'll set a price that gives me a reasonable chance of making more than my guaranteed fallback while not being so high that Bob is likely to reject it outright.
