Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to strategically set a price that maximizes my profit while considering Bob's valuation.

The product is worth at least $12,000 to me, and I know I can sell it to John for exactly $12,000 if Bob refuses.

Bob values the product at $8,000, which means he won't rationally pay more than that. However, I should start with a higher price and allow room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": $14,000}"
