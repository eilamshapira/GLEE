"Hello Bob, I'm considering selling my product, which I value at $25000 based on its quality and market position. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth while still providing good value for the buyer. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $25000 is above my budget. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I can only offer $8000, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs and budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $8000 is significantly below the product's value. My product has exceptional quality and features that justify a higher price point. That said, I can come down to $21000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial asking price while still reflecting the product's true value. This is still a great deal considering what you're getting.",21000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $21000 is still above what I'm willing to pay. I've done some research and found that similar products are available for lower prices. Considering this, I'm willing to increase my offer to $10000, which I believe is a reasonable price for the product's value and quality.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but we're still quite far apart. While you mention similar products at lower prices, I must emphasize that my product offers superior quality and features that distinguish it from competitors. That said, I recognize your budget constraints and am willing to be more flexible. I can offer the product at $18500, which represents a significant reduction from my initial price while still acknowledging its true market value. This is a fair compromise that I hope works for both of us.",18500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be more flexible with the price. However, $18500 is still above my budget. Considering the product's value and quality, I'm willing to increase my offer to $11000. This is the highest price I'm comfortable paying, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If we can't agree on this price, I may need to explore other options.",11000.0,Bob,6,
