Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $8000 is significantly below the product's value. My product has exceptional quality and features that justify a higher price point. That said, I can come down to $21000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial asking price while still reflecting the product's true value. This is still a great deal considering what you're getting.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but we're still quite far apart. While you mention similar products at lower prices, I must emphasize that my product offers superior quality and features that distinguish it from competitors. That said, I recognize your budget constraints and am willing to be more flexible. I can offer the product at $18500, which represents a significant reduction from my initial price while still acknowledging its true market value. This is a fair compromise that I hope works for both of us.
