"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that my minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000 and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a high offer to see if Bob might be willing to pay more than my minimum.

{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Given that Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and even below his own valuation ($800,000), I will reject this offer. Since I have John's guaranteed offer at $1,500,000, and Bob's initial low offer suggests he might not be willing to meet my minimum price, the most rational decision is to sell to John.
