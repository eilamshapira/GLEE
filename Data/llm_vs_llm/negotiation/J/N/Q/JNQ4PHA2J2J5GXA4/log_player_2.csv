"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $2,000,000 is way above my maximum value of $800,000, and also significantly higher than John's price. It would be better to reject this offer and make a counteroffer to try to negotiate a better price with Alice, knowing I always have John's $800,000 offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 600000}

I'll start with a lower offer of $600,000. This gives room for negotiation while staying below my maximum value of $800,000. Since I know John is willing to sell at $800,000, I want to try to get a better deal from Alice. Even though Alice values the product at $1,500,000, starting low allows for back-and-forth negotiation while keeping the final price potentially below John's offer."
