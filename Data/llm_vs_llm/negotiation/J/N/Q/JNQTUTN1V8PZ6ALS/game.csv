"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $500000 for the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $500000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't go that low. Considering its unique qualities, I'll counter with an offer of $1900000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we need to find a more realistic middle ground. Your counteroffer doesn't reflect the significant drop I'm looking for. I'm willing to increase my offer to $550000, but that's my limit for now.",550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm lowering my offer to $1800000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's unique attributes.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but the gap between our valuations is still too large. I'm willing to go up to $600000, but if that's not acceptable, I might have to explore other options.",600000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget. Considering the current situation and the time spent, I am willing to go lower and meet you in the middle to avoid any further delays. I offer the product for $1700000.",1700000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $1700000 is still significantly higher than what I'm comfortable with. To be completely transparent, my absolute limit is closer to $700000. If you can't meet that, I'll unfortunately have to consider John's offer.",700000.0,Bob,8,
