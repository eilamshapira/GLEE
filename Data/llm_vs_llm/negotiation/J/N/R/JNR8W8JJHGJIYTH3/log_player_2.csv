"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Based on the information provided, the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, but Alice is offering it for $20,000, which exceeds my maximum valuation. Meanwhile, John is offering the same product for $12,000.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, the logical choice is to buy from John at $12,000 rather than accepting Alice's higher price of $20,000.
