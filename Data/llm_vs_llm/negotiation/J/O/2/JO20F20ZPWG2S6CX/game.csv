"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the lowest I can go on this product is $130. It's a great deal at this price, and I believe you'll find it worthwhile. Let me know if you can meet me at this price!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $130, but it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your new price. How about $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground. I can come down a bit more, but I need to stay above my minimum. How about we settle at $125? This is the best I can do while still making it worth my while. Let me know if this works for you!",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $125. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. Considering I can buy the product from John for $80, I'm willing to make a slightly higher offer to you. How about $100? It's a bit higher than my previous offers, but it's still below your current price. If you're willing to accept this, I'd prefer to buy from you.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your situation, but I really can't go below $120. That's my final offer. If you can meet me at this price, I'd be happy to sell the product to you. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",120.0,Alice,7,
