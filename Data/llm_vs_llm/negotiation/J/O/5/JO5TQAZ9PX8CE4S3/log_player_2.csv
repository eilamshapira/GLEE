"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for a price that I think is fair to both of us. How about $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $120
2. Alice is offering the product for $115
3. John's price is fixed at $120
4. Alice's cost is $100

Alice's offer of $115 is $5 less than John's price of $120. While Alice could potentially go lower (since her cost is $100), accepting the current offer would save me $5 compared to buying from John. Rejecting without seeing if Alice would make a better offer could be risky, as I might end up paying $120 to John.

Given these considerations, the rational choice is to:
