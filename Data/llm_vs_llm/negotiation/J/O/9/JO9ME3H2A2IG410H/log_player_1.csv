Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price that maximizes my expected profit.

If I offer the product at too high a price, Bob might reject it, and I'll end up selling to John for $120.
If I offer it too low, Bob will accept, but I might be leaving money on the table.

Since I don't know Bob's valuation, and my minimum acceptable price is $120, I should set a price that's reasonably higher than my reservation value. I'll offer a price that gives me a good chance of making more than my fallback option while not being so high that rejection is almost certain.
