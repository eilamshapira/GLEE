"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Given that Alice is offering the product for $120, which is less than the $150 maximum I'm willing to pay, and also less than John's fixed price of $150, I should consider this offer. However, since the product is only worth $80 to Alice, there's room for negotiation to get a better price.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This gives me a chance to save more money while still having John's offer as a fallback.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has come down from her initial $120 offer to $105, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is a good improvement and already much better than John's $150 price. However, since we know the product is worth $80 to Alice, there might still be room to negotiate a slightly better price.

I'll accept this offer since it's a reasonable price that saves me $45 compared to buying from John, and the negotiation appears to be converging to a fair middle ground between Alice's cost ($80) and my maximum value ($150).
