"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, considering its features and durability. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but I'm afraid $10000 is below what I can accept for this product. The quality and features justify a higher price point. I can come down to $13500, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. This represents excellent value given the product's capabilities and durability.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. Given the product's value, I can stretch my budget to $11000. This is the maximum I can go. Let me know if you can work with this price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
