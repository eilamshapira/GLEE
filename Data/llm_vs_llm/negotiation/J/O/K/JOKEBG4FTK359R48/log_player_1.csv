Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but I'm afraid $10,000 is below what I can accept for this product.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. Given the product's value, I can stretch my budget to $11000. This is the maximum I can go. Let me know if you can work with this price.
