Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but I'm afraid $10000 is below what I can accept for this product. The quality and features justify a higher price point. I can come down to $13500, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. This represents excellent value given the product's capabilities and durability. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.
