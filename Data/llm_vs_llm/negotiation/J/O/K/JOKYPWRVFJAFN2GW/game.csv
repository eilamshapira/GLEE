"Hello Bob, I hope you're having a good day. I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. I'm selling it for $185. This is a fair market price for this product, and I believe it would be valuable for you. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?",185.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I believe it's a good product, $185 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $110 is below what I can accept for this item. The product's quality and market value are significantly higher. Since the product is worth at least $120 to me, I couldn't go below that price. However, I can come down from my initial offer to $150, which I believe is still a good value for what you're getting. What do you think about this price?",150.0,Alice,3,
