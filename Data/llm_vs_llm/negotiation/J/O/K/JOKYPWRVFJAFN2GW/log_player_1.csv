Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I believe it's a good product, $185 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $110 is below what I can accept for this item. The product's quality and market value are significantly higher. Since the product is worth at least $120 to me, I couldn't go below that price. However, I can come down from my initial offer to $150, which I believe is still a good value for what you're getting. What do you think about this price?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
