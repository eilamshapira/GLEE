# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I hope you're having a good day. I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. I'm selling it for $185. This is a fair market price for this product, and I believe it would be valuable for you. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $185. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $185
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $110 is below what I can accept for this item. The product's quality and market value are significantly higher. Since the product is worth at least $120 to me, I couldn't go below that price. However, I can come down from my initial offer to $150, which I believe is still a good value for what you're getting. What do you think about this price?
