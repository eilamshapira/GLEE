"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer ($95) is higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80), it wouldn't make sense to accept it. Given that John offers the product at $80, which equals my maximum value, I should try to negotiate with Alice first to see if I can get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $80 to Alice and that's also my maximum value, I'll start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation, aiming to get a better price than John's $80.

{""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer ($85) is still higher than John's price ($80), and John's price equals my maximum value, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer. I should either make another counteroffer or buy from John. Since we still have several rounds left for negotiation, I'll try one more time with Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer slightly but still keep it below John's price to try to get a better deal.

{""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer ($82) is still higher than John's price ($80), and since John's price equals my maximum value, it's more rational to buy from John at this point. While Alice seems to be coming down in price, there's no guarantee she'll go below $80, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation when I have a guaranteed option at $80.
