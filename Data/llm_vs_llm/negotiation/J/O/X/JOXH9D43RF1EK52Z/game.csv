"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is significantly above my budget and market value for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $1000000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. Would you consider accepting $800000 for the product?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, considering your budget and the market value you mentioned, I'm willing to make another adjustment. I believe $1800000 is a fair price that benefits both parties. This offer demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement with you.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for lowering the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1800000 is still significantly above what I can justify paying. As mentioned, I have a firm offer of $1000000 from another seller. To make it worth choosing you over the other option, I would need a better price. I can offer $900000, which is actually higher than what I initially offered. This would give you the sale while still making it worthwhile for me to choose you over my alternative.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I've reconsidered my position and I'm willing to make a significant concession to close this deal with you. I would like to offer you the product for the lowest possible price of $1250000.  I am confident this is a fair price that benefits both parties.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
