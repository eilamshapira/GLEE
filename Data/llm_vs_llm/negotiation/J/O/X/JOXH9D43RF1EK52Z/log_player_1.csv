Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is significantly above my budget and market value for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $1000000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. Would you consider accepting $800000 for the product?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for lowering the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1800000 is still significantly above what I can justify paying. As mentioned, I have a firm offer of $1000000 from another seller. To make it worth choosing you over the other option, I would need a better price. I can offer $900000, which is actually higher than what I initially offered. This would give you the sale while still making it worthwhile for me to choose you over my alternative.
