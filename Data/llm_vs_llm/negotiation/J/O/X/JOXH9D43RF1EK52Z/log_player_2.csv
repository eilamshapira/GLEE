"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional quality and the value it can bring to you, I'm confident that it's worth $2500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer because $2,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,000,000. It's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $1,000,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to negotiate a better price, but if we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,500,000 is significantly above my budget and market value for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $1,000,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. Would you consider accepting $800,000 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering your budget and the market value you mentioned, I'm willing to make another adjustment. I believe $1800000 is a fair price that benefits both parties. This offer demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll continue to negotiate because $1,800,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000). While Alice has shown willingness to reduce the price significantly, it's still not competitive with my alternative option. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, but if we can't get closer to a reasonable price, I'll need to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for lowering the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,800,000 is still significantly above what I can justify paying. As mentioned, I have a firm offer of $1,000,000 from another seller. To make it worth choosing you over the other option, I would need a better price. I can offer $900,000, which is actually higher than what I initially offered. This would give you the sale while still making it worthwhile for me to choose you over my alternative."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've reconsidered my position and I'm willing to make a significant concession to close this deal with you. I would like to offer you the product for the lowest possible price of $1250000.  I am confident this is a fair price that benefits both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John at this point. While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate and has reduced the price significantly, her ""lowest possible price"" of $1,250,000 is still above both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000). Since Alice has indicated this is her lowest possible price, continuing to negotiate would likely not lead to a better outcome. It makes the most financial sense to accept John's offer of $1,000,000."
