"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $115. It's a great value and I think you'll find it very useful. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's initial offer of $115 is close to my maximum budget of $120, but still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, I'll choose to reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try and negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I don't know how flexible Alice is with her pricing, I'll start with a slightly lower offer and see how she responds.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after considering your offer, I'm willing to lower my price. How about $110? This is a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll find it very reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Since she was willing to lower her price from $115 to $110, it's possible she may be willing to lower it further. I'll choose to reject her offer again and make another counteroffer to see if I can get an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice lowered her price to $110, I'll try to meet her halfway between her new offer and my previous counteroffer of $100. I'll offer $105, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but still lower than Alice's current price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for lowering your price to $110. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 105}"
