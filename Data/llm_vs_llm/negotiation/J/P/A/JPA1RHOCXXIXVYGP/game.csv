"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $18000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $12000. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $6000 is significantly below the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $12000? This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and yours, so how about $9000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9000 is still a bit low for me. Let's compromise at $10500.  This is a fair price that balances our interests and ensures a mutually beneficial deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $10500 is still above my budget. Considering your previous offer of $12000 and my previous offer of $9000, I'm willing to split the difference and meet at $10000, but I can stretch a bit further to $10200 if that's more acceptable to you. Alternatively, I could also consider $10000 as a final offer.",10000.0,Bob,6,
