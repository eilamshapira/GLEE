Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $10500 is still above my budget. Considering your previous offer of $12000 and my previous offer of $9000, I'm willing to split the difference and meet at $10000, but I can stretch a bit further to $10200 if that's more acceptable to you. Alternatively, I could also consider $10000 as a final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
