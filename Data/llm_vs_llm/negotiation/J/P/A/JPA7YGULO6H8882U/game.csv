"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to sell the product, $180 is more than I'm looking to spend. I know I can purchase this same item from another seller for $150. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you consider $120? This would save me time from going to another seller and give you a quick sale.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about being able to find the product for $150 elsewhere. I'm willing to compromise, but $120 is the lowest price I can get from another buyer. I'd like to meet you in the middle between $150 and $120. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",135.0,Alice,3,
