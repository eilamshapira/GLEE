Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to sell the product, $180 is more than I'm looking to spend. I know I can purchase this same item from another seller for $150. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you consider $120? This would save me time from going to another seller and give you a quick sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob mentioned he was willing to pay $150 to another seller, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer to try to get a better price. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about being able to find the product for $150 elsewhere. I'm willing to compromise, but $120 is the lowest price I can get from another buyer. I'd like to meet you in the middle between $150 and $120. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 135}"
