"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider my options here. Alice is offering the product for $180, but I know that the product is worth no more than $150 to me. I also know that I can buy the same product from John for $150 at any time.

Since Alice's offer of $180 is higher than both my maximum value ($150) and John's price ($150), it doesn't make sense to accept it.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to sell the product, $180 is more than I'm looking to spend. I know I can purchase this same item from another seller for $150. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you consider $120? This would save me time from going to another seller and give you a quick sale."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about being able to find the product for $150 elsewhere. I'm willing to compromise, but $120 is the lowest price I can get from another buyer. I'd like to meet you in the middle between $150 and $120. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","This is a good development! Alice has offered $135, which is below both my maximum value ($150) and John's price ($150). This offer would save me $15 compared to buying from John, and the price is within my acceptable range.
