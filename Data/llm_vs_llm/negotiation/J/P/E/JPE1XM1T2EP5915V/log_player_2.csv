"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $150
2. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
3. John is willing to sell it for $120
4. Alice's cost is $120

Alice's offer of $150 is higher than both:
- The maximum value I place on the product ($120)
- John's guaranteed price ($120)

There's no reason to accept this offer since it's above my maximum value, and I have a guaranteed better option with John. I could try to negotiate with Alice by rejecting and making a counteroffer, but since John offers $120 (which equals Alice's cost), it's unlikely Alice will go below this price.

The most rational decision is to buy from John.
