Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make an offer that maximizes my profit while ensuring Bob accepts it. Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, he would rationally accept any price below that. However, if I price it too high, he might reject it, and I'd have to sell to John for $100.

The best strategy is to offer Bob a price that gives him some small incentive to accept while capturing most of the value. I'll offer slightly below his valuation of $150.
