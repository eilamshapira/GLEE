"Bob, this product is a game-changer. I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. Let's start the conversation. I'm initially offering it for $1150000.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I believe your initial price is too high. The market value for similar products is significantly lower. I'd like to propose $900000 for the product, which would still provide you with a good profit margin while being more aligned with its true value.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the unique value this product provides far exceeds similar offerings. It's worth more than just a standard market comparison. However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1100000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. While I understand you believe this product has unique value, I need to consider my budget constraints as well. I can move up from my initial offer to $950000, which represents a substantial profit for you while still being within my financial parameters. This would be a fair middle ground that benefits us both.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. $950000 is still below what I can realistically accept. Let's try this: I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and your current one. How does $1025000 sound?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thanks for working with me on this, Alice. I can see we're moving toward an agreement. Your offer of $1025000 is getting more reasonable, but I'd like to suggest $990000 as our final price. This gives you a very healthy profit margin while still helping me stay within my budget constraints. I'm ready to close this deal today if we can agree on this figure.",990000.0,Bob,6,
