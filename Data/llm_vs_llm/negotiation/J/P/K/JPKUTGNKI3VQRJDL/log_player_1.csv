Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I believe your initial price is too high. The market value for similar products is significantly lower.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. While I understand you believe this product has unique value, I need to consider my budget constraints as well.

This would be a fair middle ground that benefits us both.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for working with me on this, Alice. I can see we're moving toward an agreement. Your offer of $1025000 is getting more reasonable, but I'd like to suggest $990000 as our final price. This gives you a very healthy profit margin while still helping me stay within my budget constraints. I'm ready to close this deal today if we can agree on this figure.
