"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this product is a game-changer. I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. Let's start the conversation. I'm initially offering it for $1150000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $1,150,000, which is $50,000 less than John's price of $1,200,000. While this is a savings compared to my alternative option, I should try to negotiate for a better price since the product is worth only $800,000 to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I believe your initial price is too high. The market value for similar products is significantly lower. I'd like to propose $900,000 for the product, which would still provide you with a good profit margin while being more aligned with its true value."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the unique value this product provides far exceeds similar offerings. It's worth more than just a standard market comparison. However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1100000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her offer by $50,000 to $1,100,000. While this is moving in the right direction and is $100,000 less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation given that the product is worth $800,000 to Alice. I'll continue negotiating to try to reach a better price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. While I understand you believe this product has unique value, I need to consider my budget constraints as well. I can move up from my initial offer to $950,000, which represents a substantial profit for you while still being within my financial parameters. This would be a fair middle ground that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. $950000 is still below what I can realistically accept. Let's try this: I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and your current one. How does $1025000 sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has come down further to $1,025,000, which is now $175,000 less than John's price. She's making meaningful concessions and meeting me halfway between our last positions. While I could try to negotiate further, this is a substantial improvement from her initial offer and represents good savings compared to my alternative. However, I believe there's still room for one more round of negotiation.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for working with me on this, Alice. I can see we're moving toward an agreement. Your offer of $1,025,000 is getting more reasonable, but I'd like to suggest $990,000 as our final price. This gives you a very healthy profit margin while still helping me stay within my budget constraints. I'm ready to close this deal today if we can agree on this figure."", ""product_price"": 990000}"
