"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer ($18,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000), it would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. The best option is to buy from John.
