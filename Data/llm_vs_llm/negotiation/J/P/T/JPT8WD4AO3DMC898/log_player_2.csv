"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer of $1,700,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,000,000, and also higher than John's price. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, starting negotiations at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $700,000. This is significantly below John's price of $1,000,000, which gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to buying from John. If Alice's true value is low enough, she might accept this offer or at least continue negotiating from this point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has lowered her price from $1,700,000 to $1,300,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but this is still above John's price of $1,000,000. Since I know I can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, there's no reason to accept a price higher than that. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 850000}

I'll increase my offer to $850,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer of $700,000, showing I'm willing to negotiate in good faith. It's still comfortably below John's price of $1,000,000, giving me room to potentially save money while also giving Alice room to counter if needed. Since Alice has shown willingness to reduce her price substantially, this might be a price point that could lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is still above John's price of $1,000,000, though she continues to lower her price (from $1,300,000 to $1,150,000). Since I can still get the product from John for $1,000,000, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. The negotiation is moving in the right direction, but there's no reason for me to accept a price higher than my guaranteed alternative from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 925000}

I'll increase my offer to $925,000. This continues to show good faith in negotiations by moving closer to Alice's price, while still staying below John's price of $1,000,000. Given that Alice has been consistently lowering her price, this offer might be closer to her acceptable range. If she accepts, I'll save $75,000 compared to buying from John. If she doesn't, I still have room for another counteroffer or can fall back on John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($1,050,000) is still above John's price ($1,000,000)
2. While Alice has been gradually lowering her price, the decrements are getting smaller
3. Even if negotiations continue, the best realistic outcome would likely be very close to John's price
4. We've already used 7 rounds out of 10, and there's no guarantee we'll reach a better deal than John's
5. There's a risk of losing more time and still ending up paying more than John's price

It's most rational to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 now rather than continue negotiations for potentially minimal or no savings."
