"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $3000000 is significantly above my budget and the market value for this product. I can offer you $1200000, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $3000000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $1200000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer, I'd like to propose a middle ground.",2250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $2250000 is still above what I can justify for this product. I can increase my offer to $1350000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer and reflects the maximum value I can reasonably offer considering market conditions.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
