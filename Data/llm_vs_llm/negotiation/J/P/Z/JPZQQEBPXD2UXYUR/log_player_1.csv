"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting with a competitive price, considering the product's worth to me."", ""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $3000000 is significantly above my budget and the market value for this product. I can offer you $1200000, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $1,200,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get a better deal either from Bob or by waiting for a few more rounds. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is an option, but I'd like to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob first."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $3,000,000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer, I'd like to propose a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 2250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $2250000 is still above what I can justify for this product. I can increase my offer to $1350000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer and reflects the maximum value I can reasonably offer considering market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. While Bob's increased offer of $1,350,000 is getting closer to a more acceptable range, it's still below the minimum I'm willing to accept, and selling to John for $1,500,000 remains a better option than accepting this offer. I'll try to meet Bob halfway again or slightly adjust my expectations to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $1,350,000. It shows you're serious about acquiring the product. However, I still need to consider the product's value to me. I'm trying to find a balance between your offer and my initial price.
