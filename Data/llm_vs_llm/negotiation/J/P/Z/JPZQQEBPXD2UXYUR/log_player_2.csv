"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting with a competitive price, considering the product's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject Alice's offer of $3,000,000 because:
1. It's double the price of John's offer ($1,500,000)
2. It's well above my maximum value for the product ($1,500,000)
3. We still have 9 rounds left to negotiate, so there's room to get a better price from Alice
4. If negotiations fail, I can always fall back on John's offer

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer that's more aligned with my maximum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $3,000,000 is significantly above my budget and the market value for this product. I can offer you $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

I'm making this counteroffer because:
1. It's below my maximum value ($1,500,000), giving me room to negotiate upward if needed
2. It's slightly below John's price, which gives me leverage in negotiations
3. Starting with a lower offer allows room for back-and-forth negotiation
4. The message is professional and explains my position while keeping the door open for further discussion"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $3000000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $1200000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer, I'd like to propose a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject Alice's offer of $2,250,000 because:
1. It's still significantly higher than my maximum value ($1,500,000)
2. It's also higher than John's guaranteed offer ($1,500,000)
3. While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing the price, we still have 7 rounds left to reach a better deal
4. There's no reason to accept a price that's higher than my alternative option (John's offer)

In the next round, I'll make another counteroffer that better reflects my maximum value while acknowledging Alice's movement on the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $2,250,000 is still above what I can justify for this product. I can increase my offer to $1,350,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer and reflects the maximum value I can reasonably offer considering market conditions."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm making this counteroffer because:
1. It shows good faith by increasing my previous offer by $150,000
2. It's still below both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's price, giving me room to negotiate further if needed
3. The price point might encourage Alice to make a more significant reduction in her next offer
4. The message acknowledges Alice's willingness to negotiate while firmly maintaining my position on value
5. If Alice rejects this, I still have several rounds left and the fallback option with John"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $1350000. It shows you're serious about acquiring the product. However, I still need to consider the product's value to me. I'm trying to find a balance between your offer and my initial price. Let's try to meet in the middle again, slightly adjusting from my previous offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I choose to buy from John for $1,500,000 because:
1. Alice's latest offer ($2,000,000) is still significantly above my maximum value ($1,500,000)
2. While Alice is showing willingness to negotiate, the gap between our positions is still too large
3. Even though we have more rounds available, Alice's rate of price reduction suggests we're unlikely to reach a price below $1,500,000
4. John's offer of $1,500,000 matches my maximum value, and accepting it now:
   - Guarantees I get the product at my maximum acceptable price
   - Saves time and effort from further negotiations
   - Eliminates the risk of potentially worse outcomes

It's better to take the guaranteed acceptable option rather than continue negotiations that may not result in a better deal."
