"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering the product for $150, which is the same value it's worth to her. However, you're looking for a product that's worth no more than $100 to you.

Since John is offering to sell you the same product for $100, which matches your maximum valuation, it makes more sense economically to buy from John instead of accepting Alice's higher price of $150.
