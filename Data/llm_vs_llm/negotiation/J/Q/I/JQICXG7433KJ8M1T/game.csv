"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is still a great deal for a product that's worth a lot more.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $130. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",110.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be fair.  How about we split the difference?  I'll sell it to you for $120.  That's a great price for this product and a fair compromise for both of us. ",120.0,Alice,5,
