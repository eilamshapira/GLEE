Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be fair.  How about we split the difference?  I'll sell it to you for $120.  That's a great price for this product and a fair compromise for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 120}
