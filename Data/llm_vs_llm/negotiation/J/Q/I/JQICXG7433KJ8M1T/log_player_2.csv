"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer of $150 is above my budget of $120, I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and within my budget. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a lower offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is still a great deal for a product that's worth a lot more.  Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $130 is still above my budget of $120. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $120, I don't see a reason to accept Alice's offer. I'll reject it again and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to meet Alice halfway between my previous offer and her new offer. Since she came down from $150 to $130, I'll come up from $100 to $110. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and compromise.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $130. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be fair.  How about we split the difference?  I'll sell it to you for $120.  That's a great price for this product and a fair compromise for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","This is an interesting turn of events. Alice's new offer of $120 is exactly the same price that John is offering. Since I can get the same product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in continuing to negotiate with Alice. I might as well just buy it from John, as it eliminates the risk of further negotiation and potential price increases.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
