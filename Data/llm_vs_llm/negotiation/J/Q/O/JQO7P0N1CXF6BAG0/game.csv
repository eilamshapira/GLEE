"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6000, considering the market value and my budget.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $6000 is below the product's value. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16000, which is still a competitive price considering the product's worth. I'm open to further negotiations.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that $6000 was a bit low, but $16000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7000, which is a more reasonable price considering my budget and the product's value.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price. However, $7000 is still below the product's value. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000, which is a more reasonable compromise considering the product's worth. I'm open to further negotiations.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500, which is a reasonable price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",7500.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your revised counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, $7500 is still below the product's value. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13000, which is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth. If we can't meet at this price, I may need to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,7,
