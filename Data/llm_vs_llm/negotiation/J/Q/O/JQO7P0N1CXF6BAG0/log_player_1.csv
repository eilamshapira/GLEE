Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $18,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6000, considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. Selling to John for $12,000 is a better option than accepting Bob's offer, but I want to try to negotiate a better price with Bob first.

Here's my counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $6,000 is below the product's value.

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500, which is a reasonable price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $7,500 is still significantly lower than the product's worth to me, I will reject his offer. However, considering the small increments in Bob's offers, I'm starting to think that he may not be willing to meet me at a price that I'm comfortable with.

Before making another counteroffer, I want to consider the option of selling to John for $12,000. Given the current state of the negotiations, it's likely that the best price I can get from Bob will be lower than $12,000.

However, I'll make one more attempt to negotiate with Bob. Here's my counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, $7,500 is still below the product's value. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,000, which is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth. If we can't meet at this price, I may need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
