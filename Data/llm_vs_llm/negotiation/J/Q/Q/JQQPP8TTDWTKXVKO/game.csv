"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000, considering the product's value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your feedback, Bob. While $8000 is lower than I can accept, I understand your concerns. How about I offer the product for $18000? I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts!",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for reconsidering the price, Alice. I appreciate the reduction to $18000, but it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500, which is closer to my budget and the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
