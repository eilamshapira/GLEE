"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","The offer from Alice is $1,750,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum valuation of $1,000,000. It's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $1,000,000.

Since Alice is asking for $750,000 more than what I'm willing to pay, and $750,000 more than John's price, there's no reason to accept this offer or even continue negotiating with Alice.
