"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $850000 for it, which is still a fair price considering the value you placed on it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $850000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I need to feel confident that I'm getting a fair price. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",962500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $962500 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This would be a good compromise, allowing you to get a decent price and me to get a good deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $900000. I'm still trying to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $931250. This is a fair price considering the product's value.",931250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're getting closer, but $931250 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  How about we meet in the middle at $915625?  This seems like a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",915625.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I see we're getting very close to an agreement. I appreciate your suggestion to meet in the middle at $915625, but I was thinking more along the lines of $923437.50. This price takes into account the product's value and our previous negotiations.",923437.5,Alice,7,
