"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $12,000 which exceeds my valuation, the logical choice is to buy from John at $8,000. This allows me to get the product while saving money compared to Alice's offer.
