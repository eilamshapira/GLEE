"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Based on its rarity and significance, I'm initially offering it to you for $5000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Given that the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it at exactly that price, Alice's offer of $5,000,000 is significantly overpriced. There's no reason for me to accept Alice's offer or even make a counteroffer when I can get the same product at my maximum valuation elsewhere.
