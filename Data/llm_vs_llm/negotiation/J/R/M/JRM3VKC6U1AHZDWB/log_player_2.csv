# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's still more expensive than John's offer. By rejecting this offer, I aim to negotiate a better price with Alice or simply buy from John at the lower price."
