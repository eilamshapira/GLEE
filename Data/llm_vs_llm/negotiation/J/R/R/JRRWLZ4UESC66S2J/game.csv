"Good day, Bob. I am delighted to present you with the opportunity to acquire a truly exceptional product. Given its unique qualities and the significant benefits it offers, I am initially offering it to you for $1500000. I believe this price reflects the value and potential return it holds. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600000, considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate you taking the time to consider the product's value. However, $600000 is lower than the minimum I can accept for it. I can come down a bit though. Let's meet in the middle and I'll offer it to you for $1200000. This is a significant reduction and I hope you'll see the exceptional value at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate the reduction to $1200000. However, it's still a bit out of my reach. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate. While $700000 is still lower than I can accept, I am willing to work with you. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I can offer you the product for $1000000. This is the lowest I can realistically go while still recognizing the intrinsic value of the product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $1000000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. I also want to remind you that I have other options, such as buying from John for $800000, so I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price soon.",750000.0,Bob,6,
