Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate you taking the time to consider the product's value. However, $600000 is lower than the minimum I can accept for it. I can come down a bit though. Let's meet in the middle and I'll offer it to you for $1200000. This is a significant reduction and I hope you'll see the exceptional value at this price.
