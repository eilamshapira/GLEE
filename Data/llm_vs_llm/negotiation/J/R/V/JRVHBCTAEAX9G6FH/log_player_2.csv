"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you. Considering you value it at $100, I'm willing to offer it to you for a price. How does $100 sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer is $100, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and buying from John would also cost me $100, I see no advantage in rejecting the offer or buying from John at this point. Therefore, I will accept Alice's offer as it directly gives me the product without any further action needed.
