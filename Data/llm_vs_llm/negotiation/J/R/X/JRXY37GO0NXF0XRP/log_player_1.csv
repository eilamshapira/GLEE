Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 12000}

Rationale: Since I (Alice) know that:
1. The product is worth $8,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $12,000
3. The product is worth at least $12,000 to me

It makes the most sense to offer the product to Bob at $12,000. Here's why:
- If Bob accepts (unlikely since it's above his valuation), I get $12,000
- If Bob rejects (likely), I can sell to John for $12,000

There's no incentive for me to offer a lower price since I have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, and the product is worth at least that much to me."
