"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $100. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since the product is worth $120 to me and Alice is offering it for $100, which is less than its worth to me, it's a good deal. However, I want to save as much money as I can. Given that Alice's initial offer is already $20 less than what the product is worth to me, and considering Alice's willingness to sell might allow for some negotiation, I'll choose to reject the offer and make a counteroffer to try and get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $100 and I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer but still reasonable, considering the product's worth to me and the potential for further negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
