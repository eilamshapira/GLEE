Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my strategy carefully. I know the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price. When dealing with Bob, I want to maximize my profit while ensuring I don't lose the sale if the product is worth significantly more to him.

Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'll offer a price that's reasonably higher than my minimum acceptable value, but not so high that it would immediately cause Bob to reject it if he values the product moderately above my floor price.
