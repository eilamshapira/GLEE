"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80, considering I can get a similar product from another seller for $100.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too low for this product. I know you mentioned getting a similar product for $100, but I can assure you of this product's superior quality. I can offer it to you for $130, which is a significant reduction from my initial price.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for the reduction in price. I appreciate your assurance of the product's quality, but I'm still a bit short of your asking price. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.",90.0,Bob,4,
