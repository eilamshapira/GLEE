"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $150. This is a fair price considering its features and value."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80, considering I can get a similar product from another seller for $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I know I can get $120 from John. However, I'll try one more time to negotiate with Bob for a better price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too low for this product. I know you mentioned getting a similar product for $100, but I can assure you of this product's superior quality. I can offer it to you for $130, which is a significant reduction from my initial price."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for the reduction in price. I appreciate your assurance of the product's quality, but I'm still a bit short of your asking price. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $120. Bob's offers have remained below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and given that the product is only worth $100 to him, it's unlikely he'll raise his offer significantly above $90. The guaranteed $120 from John is the better business decision."
