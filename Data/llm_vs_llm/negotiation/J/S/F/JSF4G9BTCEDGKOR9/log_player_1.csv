"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I see the value you place on this product, but my current evaluation stands a bit lower. I'm willing to buy it for $700000. I hope we can work towards a deal that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $700,000 is lower than what John is willing to pay ($800,000), and it's also lower than the product's value to me, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a price that's closer to my initial offer. Considering your evaluation, I'm willing to make a compromise.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for considering my previous offer. I understand your concerns, and in an effort to move closer to a resolution, I'm willing to adjust my counteroffer to $900000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the situation, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's new offer of $900,000 is higher than what John is willing to pay ($800,000), I will continue to negotiate with Bob to try to get an even better price. I believe there's still room for improvement, and I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the effort you're putting into finding a mutually beneficial price. Given that we're getting closer to a deal, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'd like to offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This price is more in line with my expectations, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work toward a deal. To move us closer to agreement, I'm adjusting my offer slightly to $975000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise between our positions. Let me know if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Since Bob's new offer of $975,000 is significantly higher than what John is willing to pay ($800,000), and it's also very close to my previous offer of $1,000,000, I believe it's a fair price and I'm willing to accept it. Continuing to negotiate may not yield a much better result, and I risk losing the deal or having to sell to John for a lower price."
