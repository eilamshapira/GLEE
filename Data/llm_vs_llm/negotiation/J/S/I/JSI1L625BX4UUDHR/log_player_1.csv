Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll offer the product at a price that gives me some room for negotiation while still being reasonable.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $130 is below both my minimum acceptable price ($150) and John's guaranteed offer ($150), I'll reject this offer. There's no reason to accept less than what John is willing to pay.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a new counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 165}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 165}

This offer is lower than my initial offer but still gives me a profit above my minimum price and John's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate while maintaining a reasonable margin."
