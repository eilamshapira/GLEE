"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1500000 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller offering the same product for $800000, but I'm interested in working with you. Would you consider selling the product for $650000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in working with me. The product's value is quite significant, and I believe it justifies the price. However, I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually agreeable price. How about we meet in the middle and agree on $1300000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $1300000 is still well above what I can justify spending. I have a firm alternative offer at $800000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $725000? This would be notably better than my alternative option.",725000.0,Bob,4,
