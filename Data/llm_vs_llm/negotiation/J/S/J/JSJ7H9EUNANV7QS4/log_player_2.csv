"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to discuss the sale of this product with you. I'm offering it at a competitive rate given its value. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $1500000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price offered by Alice ($1,500,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's offering price ($800,000). It would be reasonable to reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. If the negotiation doesn't lead to a better price, I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in working with me. The product's value is quite significant, and I believe it justifies the price. However, I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually agreeable price. How about we meet in the middle and agree on $1300000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's offer ($800,000). While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing the price by $200,000, the current price is still not competitive with my alternatives. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, as there might still be room for negotiation. If we can't reach a better price, I can still take John's offer of $800,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still well above what I can justify spending. I have a firm alternative offer at $800,000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $725,000? This would be notably better than my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 725000}"
