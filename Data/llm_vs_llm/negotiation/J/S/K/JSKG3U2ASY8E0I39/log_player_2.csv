"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice is offering the product for $10,000, which is more than the $8,000 it's worth to me, and more than John's price of $8,000, the rational choice is to reject this offer and either counteroffer or buy from John.

Given that John is willing to sell the product for $8,000 (which is equivalent to the product's maximum value to me), I should reject Alice's current offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations with Alice don't lead to a better price than $8,000, I always have the option to buy from John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice at a price that gives me a chance to save money compared to John's $8,000 price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $9,000 is still higher than John's price of $8,000, and higher than the maximum value of $8,000 that the product is worth to me. Since I can get the same product from John for $8,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's $9,000 offer.

I should either make another counteroffer to Alice or simply buy from John. Since Alice has already rejected my previous counteroffer and is still offering above John's price, the most rational decision would be to buy from John.
