"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in your product, $20000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8000, which is the maximum I can afford at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $8000. I understand that $20000 may have been out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than your offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'd like to offer the product to you for $15000, which is a more reasonable price considering its value.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $15000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and the fact that I'm ready to purchase immediately.",10000.0,Bob,4,
