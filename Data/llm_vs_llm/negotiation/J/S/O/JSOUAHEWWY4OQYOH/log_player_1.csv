Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in your product, $20000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8000, which is the maximum I can afford at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. My next offer will be $15,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $8,000. I understand that $20,000 may have been out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than your offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'd like to offer the product to you for $15,000, which is a more reasonable price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $15000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and the fact that I'm ready to purchase immediately. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $10,000 matches the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and it's also the same price that John is offering, I don't see a need to continue negotiating or risking losing both potential sales. I'll accept Bob's offer of $10,000."
