"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll analyze this situation:

- The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me (Bob)
- Alice's offer is $1,800,000, which is significantly higher than my valuation
- I have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $1,200,000
- Alice's product is worth $1,500,000 to her, so she has room to negotiate below that price

Alice's initial offer of $1,800,000 is much higher than my valuation and higher than John's price. It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, as I might be able to get a better price from Alice than from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice values the product at $1,500,000 and I have the alternative of buying from John at $1,200,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than both these values. This gives room for negotiation while still being potentially attractive to Alice compared to not selling.
