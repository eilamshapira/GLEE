"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to evaluate Alice's offer and determine the best decision for me.

Alice is offering the product for $100, which is the exact same price as what Jhon is offering ($100). Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and both offers are for the same price, there's no financial advantage to choosing one seller over the other.

Since the options are equivalent in terms of price, I could choose either Alice or Jhon without any difference to my savings.
