"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a product that I believe would be valuable to you. Given its quality and features, I'm selling it for $130. This is a fair price considering the item's value. Would you like to purchase it?",130.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. Would you be willing to sell it to me for this price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer of $100, I need to be transparent that I have another buyer, John, who is also willing to pay $100 for this product. Given that the product is actually worth $150 to you, I believe a price of $125 would be fair and still gives you significant value. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not comfortable paying $125 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to propose a price of $112.50. This price still gives you a good profit, and I feel it's a fair compromise. Would you be willing to accept this offer?",112.5,Bob,4,
