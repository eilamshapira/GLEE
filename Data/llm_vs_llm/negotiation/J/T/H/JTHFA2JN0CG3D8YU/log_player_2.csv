"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll evaluate Alice's offer of $1,100,000.

This price is $100,000 less than John's price of $1,200,000, which is also my maximum valuation. While I could save $100,000 by accepting this offer immediately, I should try to negotiate a better price with Alice since the product is worth only $800,000 to her, leaving room for negotiation.

Therefore, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I see that Alice has lowered her price from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, which is a $50,000 reduction. This shows she's willing to negotiate, but I still think there's room for a better deal since the product is worth $800,000 to her.

The current offer of $1,050,000 is $150,000 less than John's price of $1,200,000, which is a significant saving. However, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I see that Alice has lowered her price again to $1,000,000, which is now $200,000 less than John's price. This is a good improvement from her initial offer.

Looking at the negotiation pattern:
- Alice started at $1,100,000
- Reduced to $1,050,000
- Now reduced to $1,000,000

Meanwhile, I've moved up from $900,000 to $950,000. The gap between us has narrowed significantly, and $1,000,000 represents a price point that's $200,000 below my maximum value and $200,000 above Alice's value of the product.

This seems like a fair compromise that gives both of us equal benefit in the negotiation, and I'm getting a substantial discount compared to buying from John.
