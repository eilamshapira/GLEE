"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $15000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'll analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth $8,000 to me (my maximum value)
2. Alice's offer is $15,000, which is:
   - Nearly double my maximum value
   - Much higher than John's fixed price ($8,000)
3. Even if I negotiate with Alice, her floor price is likely around $12,000 (her value)
   - This is still above my maximum value of $8,000

Since:
- Alice's offer ($15,000) is way above my maximum value ($8,000)
- John's offer ($8,000) exactly matches my maximum value
- Alice's minimum price ($12,000) would still be too high
- There's no point in negotiating further

The rational decision is to buy from John.
