"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given the offer of $14,000 from Alice, I need to decide between accepting, rejecting, or buying from John.

*   **Accepting Alice's offer:** This means paying $14,000 for the product.
*   **Rejecting Alice's offer:** This allows for a counteroffer. There's a chance to get a better price, but also a risk of Alice rejecting all offers and potentially having to buy from John.
*   **Buying from John:** This costs $15,000.

Since the product is worth $15,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $14,000, it's a better deal than buying from John. I also know that the product is worth $12,000 to Alice so there is room to negotiate for a lower price. Given that I want to save as much money as possible, I will **reject** the offer.

Therefore, the answer is:
```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, I'm making a counteroffer. I want to see if I can get a better price.

```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Now Alice is offering $13,800.

*   **Accepting Alice's offer:** This means paying $13,800.
*   **Rejecting Alice's offer:** This allows for another counteroffer. However, I have already tried to negotiate lower than $13,800, and she didn't accept it.
*   **Buying from John:** This costs $15,000.

$13,800 is a better deal than $15,000. Since I have already tried to negotiate the price lower and failed, I will accept the offer this time.

Therefore, the answer is:
```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```"
