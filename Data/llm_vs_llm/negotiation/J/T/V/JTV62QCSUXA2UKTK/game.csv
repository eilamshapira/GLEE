"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $2000000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me, but I'm open to negotiations.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $2000000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's fair considering the value I'm placing on the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to compromise and lower my price to $1800000. I believe this is a fair adjustment, and I'm open to further negotiations.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1800000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1200000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price. However, I'm still not quite at a point where I'm comfortable selling the product. Considering your offer, I'm willing to lower my price to $1600000. I believe this is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I do have other options available to me.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other options, but I'm still hopeful we can reach an agreement. $1600000 is still higher than my ideal price point. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1400000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
