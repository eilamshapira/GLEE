"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the value in your product, I'm only prepared to invest $1000000 for it. I believe this is a fair price given alternative options I have available. Let me know if you're open to this offer.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, the value of this product to me is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $4000000, considering your interest and the potential value it could bring to you. What do you think?",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
