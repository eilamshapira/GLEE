"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($10,000) but lower than what I initially offered ($14,000), and considering Bob's true value for the product is $15,000, I believe there's room for negotiation to get closer to my initial offer or at least ensure I get a good deal.

Given that selling to John for $10,000 is the least desirable option at this point, and accepting $12,000, while better, doesn't maximize my potential earnings, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be slightly lower than my initial offer to show willingness to negotiate but still aims to capitalize on Bob's higher valuation of the product.

Counteroffer: $13,500

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and proceed with a counteroffer of $13,500.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's new offer of $13,000 is closer to my previous counteroffer of $13,500, indicating that he's willing to negotiate further and is getting closer to a price that I might find acceptable.

Considering Bob's true value for the product is $15,000, and he's now offering $13,000, which is still below my last counteroffer but significantly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($10,000) and higher than the alternative offer from John, I need to weigh the potential for further negotiation against the risk of losing the sale.

Given that Bob has moved his offer up by $1,000 from $12,000 to $13,000, it suggests he's serious about purchasing the product and is willing to pay a premium for it. My counteroffer of $13,500 was aiming to maximize my earnings, but Bob's reluctance to meet that price suggests that $13,000 might be a more realistic target for a successful sale.

Therefore, I'm inclined to accept Bob's offer of $13,000, as it represents a good compromise between my desire to maximize earnings and the need to secure a sale.
