"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation and increases my chances of earning more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is a decent amount, I'm not willing to settle for that yet. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still aim to get closer to the $1,200,000 value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm reducing the price slightly from my initial offer, showing flexibility.  $1,250,000 is still a good profit for me, and I believe Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good compromise. While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer ensures I get a reasonable profit and avoids further negotiation.  There's a risk that if I reject this offer, I might not be able to secure a better deal with Bob, and the possibility of selling to John for $1,200,000 is a tempting but uncertain alternative."
