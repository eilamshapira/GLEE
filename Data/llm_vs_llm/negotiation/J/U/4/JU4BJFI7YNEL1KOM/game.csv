,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for getting back to me, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is still too low for us. I'm willing to come down from our initial price, so let's meet in the middle at $1600000.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. My maximum budget for this purchase is $1500000. Would you be willing to consider $1400000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1400000 is still below our acceptable range. Let's settle for $1500000, which is also the amount that another buyer is willing to pay for the product. This is our final offer.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
