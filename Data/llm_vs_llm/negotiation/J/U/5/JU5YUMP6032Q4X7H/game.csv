"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $200 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can buy the same product from another seller for $100. That said, I'd like to work with you if possible. Would you consider selling it for $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on your price. However, I still can't justify paying $140 when I can purchase the same product from another seller for $100. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $90 - that would give me some savings compared to my alternative option.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have other options, but my product has certain advantages that make it worth more. I'm willing to go down a bit further, but $90 is still too low. I'll meet you closer to your ideal price. How about...",125.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate you coming down on your price, Alice. However, I need to be practical here. I'm still being offered this same product for $100 from another seller. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I can't justify paying more than what I can get elsewhere. My best offer is $95 - this gives you a slightly better price than I would pay elsewhere, but still makes financial sense for me.",95.0,Bob,6,
