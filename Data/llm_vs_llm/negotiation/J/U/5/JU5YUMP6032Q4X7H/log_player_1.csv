"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product I think you'll be really interested in. I'm offering it to you for a price of..."",
  ""product_price"": 200
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $200 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can buy the same product from another seller for $100. That said, I'd like to work with you if possible. Would you consider selling it for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, here's my decision for Round 2:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for Round 3:

```json
{
  ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too low for me. Given the quality of the product, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for..."",
  ""product_price"": 140
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on your price. However, I still can't justify paying $140 when I can purchase the same product from another seller for $100. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $90 - that would give me some savings compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for Round 5:

```json
{
  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have other options, but my product has certain advantages that make it worth more. I'm willing to go down a bit further, but $90 is still too low. I'll meet you closer to your ideal price. How about..."",
  ""product_price"": 125
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on your price, Alice. However, I need to be practical here. I'm still being offered this same product for $100 from another seller. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I can't justify paying more than what I can get elsewhere. My best offer is $95 - this gives you a slightly better price than I would pay elsewhere, but still makes financial sense for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
