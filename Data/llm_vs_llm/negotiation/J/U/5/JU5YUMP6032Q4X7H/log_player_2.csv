"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product I think you'll be really interested in. I'm offering it to you for a price of... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's offer of $200 is the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product since it's worth no more than $100 to me. Since John is offering the same product for $100, which is a much better deal, I should reject Alice's offer and either make a counteroffer or simply buy from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $200 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can buy the same product from another seller for $100. That said, I'd like to work with you if possible. Would you consider selling it for $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too low for me. Given the quality of the product, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice is now offering the product for $140, which is still higher than John's price of $100. Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me and I can get it from John for exactly $100, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on your price. However, I still can't justify paying $140 when I can purchase the same product from another seller for $100. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $90 - that would give me some savings compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have other options, but my product has certain advantages that make it worth more. I'm willing to go down a bit further, but $90 is still too low. I'll meet you closer to your ideal price. How about... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice is now offering the product for $125, which is still higher than John's price of $100. Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me and I can get it from John for exactly $100, it makes more sense to reject this offer as well.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on your price, Alice. However, I need to be practical here. I'm still being offered this same product for $100 from another seller. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I can't justify paying more than what I can get elsewhere. My best offer is $95 - this gives you a slightly better price than I would pay elsewhere, but still makes financial sense for me."", ""product_price"": 95}"
