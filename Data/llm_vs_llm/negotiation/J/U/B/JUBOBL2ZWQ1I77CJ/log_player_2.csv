"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $90
2. John's fixed price is $120
3. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
4. My goal is to save money

Alice's offer at $90 is $30 less than John's price ($120), and it's well below my maximum value for the product ($120). This is a good deal that will save me money.

Given these circumstances, I should accept Alice's offer as it's the most economical choice.
