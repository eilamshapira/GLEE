"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation of my strategy:**

*   **Anchoring High:** I'm starting with a significantly higher price than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This sets a high anchor for the negotiation and influences Bob's perception of the product's value.
*   **Potential for Profit:** I aim to extract the maximum possible value from Bob. If he values the product at more than $1,000,000, this initial price allows me to capture a larger portion of that value.
*   **Flexibility:** I understand I may have to come down, but it is better to start high and negotiate down than start low and limit my potential earnings.
*   **John as a Backstop:** Knowing I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John allows me to be confident and less pressured during negotiations. I am willing to walk away if Bob's offers are too low.
*   **Learning Opportunity:** This first round will give me information about Bob's willingness to pay. His response will inform my strategy in subsequent rounds."
