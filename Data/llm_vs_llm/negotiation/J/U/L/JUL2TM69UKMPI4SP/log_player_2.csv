"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer is $12,000, which is the same price as John's offer, and this is only round 1, I should reject and make a counteroffer. The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice and $12,000 is my maximum value, I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation. I'll offer a price closer to Alice's cost but with some profit margin for her.

{""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price by $500, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still quite high, and we still have 7 rounds left. Since there's still significant room between her cost ($8,000) and this offer ($11,500), I should continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice came down $500 from her initial offer, so I'll increase my previous offer by a similar amount to show good faith in the negotiation. However, I'll still maintain a price that gives me good savings compared to John's offer.

{""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price again by $500, now at $11,000. This shows she's willing to continue negotiating, and we're making progress. We still have 5 rounds left, and there's still a significant gap between her cost ($8,000) and current offer ($11,000). I should continue negotiating to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has been making $500 decrements, and we've established a pattern. I'll increase my offer by $500 as well to show continued good faith in the negotiation.
