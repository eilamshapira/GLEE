"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in your product, $15000 is the maximum I could pay, and I can actually get it from another seller at that exact price. I'd like to work with you instead, but I would need a better deal to make it worthwhile. Would you consider $12000 for the product? This would be a fair price that still allows you to make a reasonable profit while giving me some savings.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. However, given the quality and demand for this product, I must stick with my valuation. I'm prepared to offer it for $15000, which is my best price. Let me know if this works for you.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you value your product highly. However, I need to be transparent that I have another option to purchase this exact product from Jhon for $15000. Since both you and Jhon are offering the same price, I'm hoping we can find a way to make our deal more attractive. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13500. This gives you a sale today while allowing me some savings compared to my alternative option. What do you say?",13500.0,Bob,4,
