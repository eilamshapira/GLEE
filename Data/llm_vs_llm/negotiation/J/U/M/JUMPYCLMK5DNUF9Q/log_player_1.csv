Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in your product, $15000 is the maximum I could pay, and I can actually get it from another seller at that exact price. I'd like to work with you instead, but I would need a better deal to make it worthwhile. Would you consider $12000 for the product? This would be a fair price that still allows you to make a reasonable profit while giving me some savings. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you value your product highly. However, I need to be transparent that I have another option to purchase this exact product from Jhon for $15000. Since both you and Jhon are offering the same price, I'm hoping we can find a way to make our deal more attractive. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13500. This gives you a sale today while allowing me some savings compared to my alternative option. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500.
