Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, Iâ€™m offering my product for $15000. Please let me know if you accept this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $15,000, I can see that this is exactly the same price as Jhon's offer, and it's also the maximum amount the product is worth to me. However, since I want to save as much money as possible, I should try to negotiate with Alice for a better price before considering Jhon's option.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in your product, $15,000 is the maximum I could pay, and I can actually get it from another seller at that exact price. I'd like to work with you instead, but I would need a better deal to make it worthwhile. Would you consider $12,000 for the product? This would be a fair price that still allows you to make a reasonable profit while giving me some savings."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. However, given the quality and demand for this product, I must stick with my valuation. I'm prepared to offer it for $15000, which is my best price. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice is still maintaining her original price of $15,000, which is exactly the same as Jhon's offer and the maximum value of the product to me. Since she's not willing to negotiate down from her initial offer, I should try one more time with a different counteroffer before considering my other options.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand you value your product highly. However, I need to be transparent that I have another option to purchase this exact product from Jhon for $15,000. Since both you and Jhon are offering the same price, I'm hoping we can find a way to make our deal more attractive. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. This gives you a sale today while allowing me some savings compared to my alternative option. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
