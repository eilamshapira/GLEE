"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given the information, Alice is offering the product at $1,400,000, which is $200,000 more than what it's worth to me (my maximum value is $1,200,000). 

Meanwhile, John is willing to sell the exact same product for $1,200,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

Buying from Alice at her current offer would mean I'm overpaying by $200,000 compared to my valuation, while buying from John would get me the product at exactly my maximum valuation.
