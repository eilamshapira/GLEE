"Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you might be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $10000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your product, but $10000 is more than I'm willing to pay. I know I can get a similar product from another seller for $8000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer you $6500 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without having to find another buyer. What do you think?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $8500? This gives you a good price while still allowing me to get a fair return.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I should be transparent that I have another seller offering the same product for $8000. For me to choose your product over theirs, I'd need a better price. I can offer $7500, which still gives you a decent return while providing me with some savings compared to my alternative. Does that work for you?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your situation, but $7500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $8000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
