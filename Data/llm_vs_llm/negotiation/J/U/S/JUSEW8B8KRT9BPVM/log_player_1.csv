Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your product, but $10000 is more than I'm willing to pay. I know I can get a similar product from another seller for $8000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer you $6500 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without having to find another buyer. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I should be transparent that I have another seller offering the same product for $8000. For me to choose your product over theirs, I'd need a better price. I can offer $7500, which still gives you a decent return while providing me with some savings compared to my alternative. Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
