"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you might be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $10000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer. She's asking for $10,000, which is more than the product is worth to me (maximum $8,000) and more than John's guaranteed offer of $8,000.

Since Alice's price exceeds my maximum valuation, there's no reason to accept it. I should either make a counteroffer or go with John's option.

I'll reject this offer to see if I can negotiate Alice down to a better price than John's $8,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your product, but $10,000 is more than I'm willing to pay. I know I can get a similar product from another seller for $8,000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer you $6,500 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without having to find another buyer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 6500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $8500? This gives you a good price while still allowing me to get a fair return.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has come down from $10,000 to $8,500, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still $500 more than John's offer of $8,000, and the product is only worth up to $8,000 to me.

Since I can get the same product from John for $8,000, and that price equals my maximum valuation, there's no reason to pay Alice's higher price of $8,500.

I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can get her to lower her price below $8,000. If not, I always have John's option available.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I should be transparent that I have another seller offering the same product for $8,000. For me to choose your product over theirs, I'd need a better price. I can offer $7,500, which still gives you a decent return while providing me with some savings compared to my alternative. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your situation, but $7500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $8000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has now matched John's price of $8,000, which is the maximum value the product has to me. Since both offers are now identical at $8,000, there's no financial advantage to buying from John instead of Alice.

While I could try to negotiate further with Alice, there's no guarantee she would lower her price below $8,000, and I risk her walking away if I push too hard. Since $8,000 is a fair price (equal to my maximum valuation), I'll accept Alice's offer.
