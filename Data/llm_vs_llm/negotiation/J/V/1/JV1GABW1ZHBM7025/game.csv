"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find the price to be a bit high. I'm willing to purchase the product for $5000. I believe this price is more aligned with my budget and the market value. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $5000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand budget concerns, but I need to be fair about the product's worth. I can come down to $13500, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the product's quality and market value. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, $13500 is still much higher than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to raise my offer to $5500 to meet you in the middle. I hope we can find some common ground. Please consider this new offer.",5500.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. Your offer of $5500 is still well below what I can accept given that the product is worth considerably more. I'm willing to reduce my price to $12500, which is nearly at my absolute minimum. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and is quite fair considering the product's quality and market value. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price point.",12500.0,Alice,5,
