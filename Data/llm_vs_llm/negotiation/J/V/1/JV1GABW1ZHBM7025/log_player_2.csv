Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $5000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand budget concerns, but I need to be fair about the product's worth. I can come down to $13500, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the product's quality and market value. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.

# Bob's message:
Hi Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, $13,500 is still much higher than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to raise my offer to $5,500 to meet you in the middle. I hope we can find some common ground. Please consider this new offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. Your offer of $5500 is still well below what I can accept given that the product is worth considerably more. I'm willing to reduce my price to $12500, which is nearly at my absolute minimum. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and is quite fair considering the product's quality and market value. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price point.

Hi Alice, thank you for your time and consideration. However, I have decided to purchase the product from another seller who is offering it for a price that better fits my budget. I appreciate your efforts to negotiate, and I wish you the best in finding another buyer."
