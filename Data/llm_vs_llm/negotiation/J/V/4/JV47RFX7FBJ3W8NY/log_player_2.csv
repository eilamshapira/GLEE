"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. Given its value and rarity, I'm willing to let it go for $14500. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $14,500 is better than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Let's see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, $14,500 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $13750. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$13,750 is a good deal for Bob. It's still cheaper than John's price and significantly lower than Alice's initial asking price.  There's a good chance Bob can get a better price, but there's also a risk that Alice will walk away or increase the price further.  It's better to secure the deal at a fair price than to keep negotiating and risk losing out."
