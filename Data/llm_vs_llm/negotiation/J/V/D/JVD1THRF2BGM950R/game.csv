"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - $132.50.  That's a fair price for both of us.",132.5,Bob,4,
"Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, I need to stick a bit closer to my initial valuation. How about we settle at $134? It's just a small step up from your offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",134.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
