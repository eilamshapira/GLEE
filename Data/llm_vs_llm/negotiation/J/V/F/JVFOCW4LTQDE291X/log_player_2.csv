"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. How about I offer it to you for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll analyze this situation:

- Alice is offering the product for $100
- John (alternative seller) is selling it for $150
- The product is worth no more than $150 to me
- My goal is to buy the product while saving money

Alice's offer of $100 is $50 less than John's price of $150, so I would save money by accepting Alice's offer. This is a clear choice since both options result in me getting the product, but Alice's offer costs less.
