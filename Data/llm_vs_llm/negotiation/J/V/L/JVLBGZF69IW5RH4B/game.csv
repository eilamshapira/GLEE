"Hi Alice! Thanks for your offer, but $18000 is quite high for me. Given that I can get the same product elsewhere for $15000, I'd like to propose $13000. This would give you a quick sale while giving me some savings compared to my other option. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $16000. Let me know your thoughts!",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I need to be direct - I have a guaranteed option to buy this product from John for $15000. For me to choose you over that option, I'd need a better price. I can offer $14000, which would still give you a reasonable profit while saving me some money. Would that work for you?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob! Thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I believe the product is worth a bit more. How about we finalize the deal for $15500? I think it's a fair compromise. Looking forward to hearing from you!",15500.0,Alice,5,
