Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! Thanks for your offer, but $18000 is quite high for me. Given that I can get the same product elsewhere for $15000, I'd like to propose $13000. This would give you a quick sale while giving me some savings compared to my other option. What do you think?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
