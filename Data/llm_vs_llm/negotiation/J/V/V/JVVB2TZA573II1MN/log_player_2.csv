"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's offer is $10,000, which is higher than the $8,000 the product is worth to me, and higher than John's price of $8,000, it makes more sense to buy from John. Alice's offer exceeds both my maximum valuation and the alternative option available.
