**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above my maximum budget.  I want to save as much as possible, so I'll try to negotiate with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your position. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, so how about we settle for $13750? This way, we can both walk away from the deal happy. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750

Alice's counteroffer of $13,750 is still within my budget and a significant saving compared to John's offer.  It's also a good compromise.  I'll take it!"
