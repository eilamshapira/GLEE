"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $400000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",400000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $400000 is significantly below my expectations. I'm willing to negotiate further. How about $1800000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",1800000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the value of this product justifies a higher price. Let's meet in the middle at $1700000. What do you say?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1700000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $600000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering my budget constraints. Can we discuss this further?",600000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $600000 is still not meeting the value of the product. Let's try to find a more reasonable middle ground. How about $1600000? This is closer to your budget and still reflects the product's worth.",1600000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. Let's consider $1550000. This price is very close to my minimum and should be within a reasonable range for you. What are your thoughts?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
