"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $10000. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $10,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $8,000.
