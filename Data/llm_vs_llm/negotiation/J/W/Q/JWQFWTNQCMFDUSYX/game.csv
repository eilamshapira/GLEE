"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15000 is way too high for me. My budget is around $6000. Would you consider selling it for that price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $6000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I am willing to lower my price to $13500. Let me know if this works for you.",13500.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to meet a certain price point. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks Alice, but $13500 is still too high for me. The most I'm willing to offer is $7000.",7000.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7000 is still below my minimum price. I can go as low as $12500, which is my final offer. Let me know if you can meet this price.",12500.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. My final offer is $12500. This is the lowest I can go while still valuing the product appropriately. Please let me know if you can accept this price.",12500.0,Alice,5,
