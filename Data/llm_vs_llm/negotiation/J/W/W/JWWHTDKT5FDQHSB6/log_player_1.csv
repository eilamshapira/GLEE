Send your offer to Bob.,"I will offer the product at $115. This price is strategically chosen because:
1. It's below Bob's valuation of $120, giving him an incentive to accept
2. It's well above my minimum acceptable price of $100
3. It allows Bob to make a small profit ($5) while maximizing my earnings
4. If Bob rejects, I still have John as a backup buyer at $100
