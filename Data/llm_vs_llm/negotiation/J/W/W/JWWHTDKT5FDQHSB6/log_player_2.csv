"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think about this carefully. 

The product is worth at most $120 to me. I have two offers:
1. Alice's offer: $115
2. John's offer: $120

If I reject Alice's offer, my only alternative is to buy from John for $120.

Since Alice's offer ($115) is $5 less than John's offer ($120), and both are within my maximum value of $120, I should accept Alice's offer to save money.
