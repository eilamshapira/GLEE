"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for what I believe is a very fair price considering its value. It's a great opportunity for you! Let's start at $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for my budget. I know similar products are available for much less. I can offer $85 for the product. This would still give you a good return, and I'm ready to make the purchase right away.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. I've already come down a bit, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $135? I really think this product is perfect for you.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $135 is still more than I can justify spending. I've done my market research, and I know similar products are available for much less. I can increase my offer to $95. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm genuinely trying to work with you here. I am confident that the value you will get from the product is far greater than my asking price. Let's try $127.5, split the difference?",127.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but I need to be transparent with you. I know I can get this same product elsewhere for $100, and that's really my maximum budget. I'm willing to offer you $98 right now to close the deal. This would benefit both of us - you make a sale, and I get the product from you rather than going to another seller.",98.0,Bob,6,
