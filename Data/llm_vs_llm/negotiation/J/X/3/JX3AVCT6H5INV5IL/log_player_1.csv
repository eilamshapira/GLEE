"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for what I believe is a very fair price considering its value. It's a great opportunity for you! Let's start at $150."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for my budget. I know similar products are available for much less. I can offer $85 for the product. This would still give you a good return, and I'm ready to make the purchase right away. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. I've already come down a bit, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $135? I really think this product is perfect for you."", ""product_price"": 135}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $135 is still more than I can justify spending. I've done my market research, and I know similar products are available for much less. I can increase my offer to $95. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm genuinely trying to work with you here. I am confident that the value you will get from the product is far greater than my asking price. Let's try $127.5, split the difference?"", ""product_price"": 127.5}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but I need to be transparent with you. I know I can get this same product elsewhere for $100, and that's really my maximum budget. I'm willing to offer you $98 right now to close the deal. This would benefit both of us - you make a sale, and I get the product from you rather than going to another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98.
