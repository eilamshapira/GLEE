"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your proposal, I believe we can find a middle ground that works better for both of us. Given the market conditions and considering that I have another option available, I would like to offer $10800 for the product. This represents a fair profit margin while still being an attractive price for me as a buyer.",10800.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your prompt response and for sharing your thoughts on the market conditions. I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. After considering your offer, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my initial price. I can offer the product to you for $11500, which still represents a competitive price while allowing me to meet my minimum requirements.

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you reducing your price and showing flexibility. While $11500 is better than your initial offer, I believe we can still find a price that better serves both our interests. I'm willing to increase my offer to $11000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer and provides you with a solid profit margin. This price point would make the deal much more attractive to me than my alternative options.",11000.0,Bob,4,
