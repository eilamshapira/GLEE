Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your proposal, I believe we can find a middle ground that works better for both of us. Given the market conditions and considering that I have another option available, I would like to offer $10800 for the product. This represents a fair profit margin while still being an attractive price for me as a buyer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you reducing your price and showing flexibility. While $11500 is better than your initial offer, I believe we can still find a price that better serves both our interests. I'm willing to increase my offer to $11000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer and provides you with a solid profit margin. This price point would make the deal much more attractive to me than my alternative options.
