Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 150}

Rationale: Since I know that:
1. The product is worth $150 minimum to me
2. Bob values the product at only $80
3. I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $150

There's no reason for me to offer the product to Bob for less than $150. Bob will likely reject this offer since it's well above his valuation of $80, but that's fine because I can then sell to John for $150. Making a lower offer would only result in less profit for me, as I shouldn't sell for less than my guaranteed alternative of $150 from John."
