"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given Alice's offer of $150, I'm analyzing my options:

1. The product is worth at most $80 to me, so paying $150 would be a significant loss.
2. I can counterofffer in the next round.
3. I can immediately buy from John for $80, which matches the maximum value I place on the product.

Since Alice's initial price is very high (equal to her valuation) and much higher than my maximum value, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations don't progress favorably, I always have the option to buy from John at $80.
