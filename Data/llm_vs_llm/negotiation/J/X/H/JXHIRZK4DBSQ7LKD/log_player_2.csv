"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. There is no benefit to buying from Alice at that price, as you can get the same product from John for the same price.  You want to save money, and rejecting Alice's offer keeps that option open."
