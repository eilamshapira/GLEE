"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision that maximizes my value.

The product is worth at most $8,000 to me (Bob).
Alice is offering to sell it to me for $10,000.
John is willing to sell the same product for $8,000.

If I accept Alice's offer, I'll pay $10,000 for something worth $8,000 to me, which means I'd lose $2,000 in value.
If I buy from John, I'll pay exactly what the product is worth to me ($8,000).

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, the logical choice is to buy from John.
