"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price of $170 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's alternative offer ($120). It would not make sense to accept this offer when I have better options. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 100}

I'll start with a relatively low offer of $100. This gives room for negotiation while still being a reasonable starting point, considering:
1. The product is worth $150 to Alice
2. I value it at no more than $120
3. I have John's offer of $120 as a backup

If Alice rejects this, we can try to find a middle ground in subsequent rounds, but I want to maintain the option to go with John's offer if Alice won't come down to a reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice has significantly reduced her price from $170 to $135, this is still above both my maximum value ($120) and John's offer ($120). There's no reason to accept this price when I can get the same product from John for $120. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round, trying to get a price at or below $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 110}

I'll offer $110, which is:
1. Higher than my previous offer of $100, showing willingness to negotiate
2. Still below my maximum value of $120
3. Still allows Alice to make some profit (as it's worth $150 to her)
4. Gives us room to potentially meet in the middle while staying under my $120 limit

If Alice doesn't accept this or counter with something at or below $120, I can always fall back on John's offer of $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John because:
1. Alice's offer ($125) is still above John's price ($120)
2. Alice's offer is also above my maximum value ($120)
3. While Alice has been coming down in price, there's no guarantee she'll go below $120
4. We've already gone through 5 rounds of negotiation, and time is valuable
5. John's offer is guaranteed and matches my maximum value

It makes the most economic sense to take John's guaranteed offer of $120 rather than continue negotiating or accept a higher price from Alice."
