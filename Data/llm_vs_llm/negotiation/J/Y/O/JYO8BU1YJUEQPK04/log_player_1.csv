Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider an offer that will be attractive to Bob while maximizing my profit.

Bob values the product at $1,500,000, which means he would be willing to pay up to that amount. 
I need at least $1,200,000, which is both my minimum acceptable value and my backup option with John.

If I offer too close to $1,500,000, Bob might reject it. If I offer too close to $1,200,000, I'm leaving money on the table.

A reasonable strategy would be to offer a price that gives Bob some of the surplus value while maximizing my profit. A price of $1,350,000 would split the difference between my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's maximum ($1,500,000), giving both of us a good deal.
