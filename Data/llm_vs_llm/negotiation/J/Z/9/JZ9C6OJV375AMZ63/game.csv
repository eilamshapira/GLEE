"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $120 for it. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I can't accept $120 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I understand $180 might be high for you, so I can reduce my price to $165. This is still a great value for such a quality product. Let me know if this works for you.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $165, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $142.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",142.5,Bob,4,
