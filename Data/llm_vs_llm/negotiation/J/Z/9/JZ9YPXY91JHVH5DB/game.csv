"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $6000, considering the market value and my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for this price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $6000 is significantly below the product's value. While I can be somewhat flexible on the price, I couldn't go below $12500 as this reflects the product's true market value and quality. Would you consider this more reasonable price?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $6000 was a bit low. However, $12500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to offer $9250 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our two positions.",9250.0,Bob,4,
