Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $14,000. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $6000, considering the market value and my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $6,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but if we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I can always sell to John at $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $6,000 is significantly below the product's value. While I can be somewhat flexible on the price, I couldn't go below $12,500 as this reflects the product's true market value and quality. Would you consider this more reasonable price?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $6000 was a bit low. However, $12500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to offer $9250 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our two positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $9,250 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and John is willing to pay $12,000, it makes the most financial sense to sell to John. The negotiation with Bob is unlikely to reach a price that would exceed John's offer."
