Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer Bob for my product. The product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I have John as a guaranteed backup buyer at exactly that price. Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I should set a price above my minimum acceptable value.

I'll set a price that provides a good balance - high enough to significantly improve my earnings if Bob accepts, but not so high that it would likely cause an immediate rejection.
