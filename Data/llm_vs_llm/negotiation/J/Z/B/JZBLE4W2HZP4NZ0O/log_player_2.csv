"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is above my maximum budget of $800,000, it makes sense to reject her offer and try to negotiate a better price. Buying from John for $800,000 is an option, but I'd like to see if I can get an even better deal from Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm not sure what Alice's bottom line is, I'll start with a price that's closer to my maximum budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,000,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000, but it's getting closer. I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000, but I'm interested in continuing the negotiation to see if I can get a better price.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer. Since Alice reduced her price by $200,000, I'll try to meet her halfway and see if we can find a mutually acceptable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Next, I'll send a new counteroffer to Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $900,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. At this point, I think it's clear that Alice is not willing to sell the product to me at or below my budget.

Given that I have the option to buy the product from John for $800,000, which is within my budget, I think it's time to stop negotiating with Alice and take the better deal.
