"Alice's offer: The product price will be $24,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $24,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The rational choice is to buy from John for $10,000 because:
1. Alice's offer ($24,500) is significantly higher than John's price ($10,000)
2. Alice's offer is also well above my maximum valuation of $10,000
3. I can save $14,500 by buying from John instead of accepting Alice's offer"
