"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $18,000
3. John's price is $10,000

The logical choice would be to buy from John for $10,000 because:
- It's cheaper than Alice's offer by $8,000
- It matches my maximum valuation of the product
- There's no reason to pay more when I have a guaranteed option at $10,000
