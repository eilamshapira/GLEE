"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has tremendous value, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects its worth. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer.",5000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $5000000 is out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I believe the product is valuable, but I don't think it's worth that much to me. I'm willing to pay a significant amount, but I need to stay within my means.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $5000000 may be out of your budget, but I still believe the product has tremendous value. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I've considered your offer of $750000, and I'm making a significant concession. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",3000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $3000000 is still significantly above my budget. I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good product and staying within my means. I'd like to make another counteroffer, hoping we can meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to be realistic about its value to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I've considered your latest offer of $850000, and I'm making another concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a price that works for both of us.",2200000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for another concession, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $2200000 is still significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm starting to consider alternative options, as I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell the product to me for $800000. I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to be realistic about the price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but it needs to be much closer to my budget.",799000.0,Bob,6,
