Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $5000000 is out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I believe the product is valuable, but I don't think it's worth that much to me. I'm willing to pay a significant amount, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $750,000 because it's significantly lower than my initial offer and I believe the product is worth more. I'd like to make a counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle. My next offer will be $3,000,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $3000000 is still significantly above my budget. I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good product and staying within my means. I'd like to make another counteroffer, hoping we can meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to be realistic about its value to me.

I reject Bob's offer of $850,000 because it's still below my target price and I believe the product is worth more. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to see a more significant increase in Bob's offer. My next counteroffer will be $2,200,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest proposal."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for another concession, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $2200000 is still significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm starting to consider alternative options, as I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell the product to me for $800000. I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to be realistic about the price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but it needs to be much closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $799,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $799,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

I decide to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. Bob's latest offer of $799,000 is too low, and I don't think we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Additionally, Bob mentioned that he has another seller (John) who is willing to sell the product to him for $800,000, which suggests that John is willing to buy the product from me for $1,000,000, a price that is higher than Bob's offer. I'd rather sell the product to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000 than continue negotiating with Bob and risk getting a lower price."
