Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make a strategic offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to me and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at that price, I can afford to make a higher offer to Bob to maximize my potential profit. I'll set the price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but not so high that it would immediately deter most buyers.
