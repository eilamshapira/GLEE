,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $100 is a bit high for me. Given that I have other options available, I'd like to offer $85 for the product. This would still give you a profitable sale, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $95. This is still a fair price for both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I can see you're trying to work with me here. I can increase my offer to $90, which would be right in the middle between our last positions. This gives you a solid profit margin while still being a fair price for me. What do you say?",90.0,Bob,4,
