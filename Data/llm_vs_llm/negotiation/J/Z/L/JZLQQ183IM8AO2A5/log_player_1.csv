Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $100 is a bit high for me. Given that I have other options available, I'd like to offer $85 for the product. This would still give you a profitable sale, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $95. This is still a fair price for both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I can see you're trying to work with me here.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
