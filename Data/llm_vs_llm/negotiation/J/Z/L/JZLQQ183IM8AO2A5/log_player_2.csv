"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think about this strategically:
1. The product is worth $80 to Alice
2. I won't pay more than $120 (which is what John offers)
3. Since this is just round 1, and I have 10 rounds to negotiate, I should try to get a better price
4. $100 is already better than John's price ($120), but I should try to get closer to Alice's cost ($80)

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's cost but not so low that it would be immediately rejected. Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, I'll offer a price that gives her a reasonable profit while still saving me money.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $100 is a bit high for me. Given that I have other options available, I'd like to offer $85 for the product. This would still give you a profitable sale, and I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $95. This is still a fair price for both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice has moved down from $100 to $95, showing willingness to negotiate
2. The $5 reduction suggests there might be more room for negotiation
3. $95 is still well below John's price of $120
4. We still have 7 more rounds possible
5. Since Alice moved down $5, I should try one more counter to meet in the middle

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down $5 from her initial offer, I'll increase my offer by $5 from my previous one, showing willingness to meet in the middle.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I can see you're trying to work with me here. I can increase my offer to $90, which would be right in the middle between our last positions. This gives you a solid profit margin while still being a fair price for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
