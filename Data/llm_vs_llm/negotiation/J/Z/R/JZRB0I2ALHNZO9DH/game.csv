"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18000. This is a competitive price for what you're getting.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, your asking price of $18000 is significantly above my budget. I know that John is offering the same product for $8000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $5000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I must point out that your information about John's offer seems incorrect. I know the true market value of this product, and $5000 is well below its worth. However, I'm willing to be flexible and can reduce my initial asking price. Given the product's quality and value, I can offer it to you for $15000. This is still a fair price considering its features and benefits.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for lowering your price, but $15000 is still well above what I can justify paying. I want to be transparent with you - I do have a confirmed offer from John for $8000, and that's my alternative if we can't reach an agreement. However, I'd prefer to purchase from you if possible. To make it worth both our while, I'm willing to offer $6500. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and gives you $6500 today rather than continuing to search for a buyer willing to pay your asking price.",6500.0,Bob,4,
