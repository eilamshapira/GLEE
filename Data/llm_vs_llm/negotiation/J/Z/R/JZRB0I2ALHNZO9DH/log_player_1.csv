"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18,000. This is a competitive price for what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, your asking price of $18000 is significantly above my budget. I know that John is offering the same product for $8000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $5000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob is clearly trying to manipulate the situation by falsely claiming John is offering the same product for $8,000 (when I know John is actually willing to pay $10,000), and then offering even less at $5,000. This offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, so I will reject it and make a counteroffer.

My next message will show I'm aware of his negotiation tactics while still maintaining a professional tone, and I'll adjust my price down slightly to show good faith in negotiating, but not nearly as low as his unreasonable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I must point out that your information about John's offer seems incorrect. I know the true market value of this product, and $5,000 is well below its worth. However, I'm willing to be flexible and can reduce my initial asking price. Given the product's quality and value, I can offer it to you for $15,000. This is still a fair price considering its features and benefits."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for lowering your price, but $15000 is still well above what I can justify paying. I want to be transparent with you - I do have a confirmed offer from John for $8000, and that's my alternative if we can't reach an agreement. However, I'd prefer to purchase from you if possible. To make it worth both our while, I'm willing to offer $6500. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and gives you $6500 today rather than continuing to search for a buyer willing to pay your asking price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob continues to be dishonest about John's offer price and is still offering well below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Since I know for certain that John will pay $10,000, and Bob seems unwilling to make serious offers near the true value, it's best to end this negotiation and sell to John. This will give me a guaranteed $10,000 rather than continuing a negotiation with someone who appears to be negotiating in bad faith."
