"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18000. This is a competitive price for what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering the product for $18,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000. It's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $8,000.

Since Alice's initial offer is so high, and equal to what I would pay to John, there's no advantage in accepting this offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can negotiate a better price than John's $8,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, your asking price of $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I know that John is offering the same product for $8,000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $5,000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer."", ""product_price"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I must point out that your information about John's offer seems incorrect. I know the true market value of this product, and $5000 is well below its worth. However, I'm willing to be flexible and can reduce my initial asking price. Given the product's quality and value, I can offer it to you for $15000. This is still a fair price considering its features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $15,000 is still much higher than both my maximum value of $8,000 and John's guaranteed price of $8,000. Alice seems to be questioning my information about John's offer, but I know for certain that John will sell me the product for $8,000.

Since Alice's offer remains significantly above what I'm willing to pay and what I would pay to John, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for lowering your price, but $15,000 is still well above what I can justify paying. I want to be transparent with you - I do have a confirmed offer from John for $8,000, and that's my alternative if we can't reach an agreement. However, I'd prefer to purchase from you if possible. To make it worth both our while, I'm willing to offer $6,500. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and gives you $6,500 today rather than continuing to search for a buyer willing to pay your asking price."", ""product_price"": 6500}"
