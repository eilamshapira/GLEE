"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know I can buy the same product from John for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $80 for the product. This way you can make a quick sale, and I can save a bit compared to John's price. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. However, $80 is below my minimum selling price for this product. I'm willing to go down to $120, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",120.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
