Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know I can buy the same product from John for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $80 for the product. This way you can make a quick sale, and I can save a bit compared to John's price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. However, $80 is below my minimum selling price for this product.
