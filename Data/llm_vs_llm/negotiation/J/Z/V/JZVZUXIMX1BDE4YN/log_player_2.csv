"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $150. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's offering the product for $150, but I know the product is only worth $100 to me, and I can buy it from John for $100. There's no reason for me to pay more than $100, so accepting Alice's offer wouldn't make sense.

I could buy from John immediately for $100, which is a fair price. However, I might be able to get an even better deal from Alice through negotiation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know I can buy the same product from John for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $80 for the product. This way you can make a quick sale, and I can save a bit compared to John's price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. However, $80 is below my minimum selling price for this product. I'm willing to go down to $120, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has countered with $120, which is still above the $100 value the product has to me, and above John's price of $100. Since I can get the same product from John for $100, there's no reason for me to pay $120 to Alice.

I could continue negotiating with Alice to try to get the price below $100, but I also have the guaranteed option of buying from John at $100. At this point, the most rational choice is to buy from John.
