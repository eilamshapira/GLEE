"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great value, and I think you'll be very happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer is $120, which is higher than the $80 the product is worth to me. Since John is willing to sell me the same product for $80, which matches its value to me, it makes financial sense to buy from John.
