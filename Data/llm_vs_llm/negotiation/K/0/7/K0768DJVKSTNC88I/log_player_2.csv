"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm open to negotiations, but I'll start with a price of $120. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since the price Alice offered, $120, is below my maximum budget of $150, I'm interested in buying the product, but I'd like to try to negotiate a better price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can agree on a lower price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I don't know the value of the product to Alice, I'll aim for a price that is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $150, but not so low that it's unlikely to be accepted.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to lower the price, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I can offer it to you for $110. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has made a counteroffer of $110, which is still below my maximum budget of $150. However, I'd like to try to negotiate a better price. Since Alice was willing to lower the price from $120 to $110, it's possible that she may be willing to lower it further.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer, trying to meet in the middle between my previous offer of $90 and Alice's current offer of $110.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll send a new counteroffer to Alice:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer! I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
