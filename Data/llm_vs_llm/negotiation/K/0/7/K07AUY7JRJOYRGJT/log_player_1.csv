Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this offer:

1. My minimum acceptable price is $800,000 since I have John's guaranteed offer
2. Bob's valuation is unknown to me, but he might value it significantly higher
3. Given this is a high-value product, I should aim for a substantial margin above my minimum
4. I want to set a price high enough to capture good value but not so high that it will certainly be rejected

Based on this reasoning, I'll set a price significantly above my minimum, but still within a potentially acceptable range for a valuable product.
