"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you being interested in the product, however, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $15000? I believe that is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle of $18000 and $8000 would be $13000, not $15000. Considering that, I'd like to propose a price of $10500. It's still a bit higher than I initially thought, but I'm willing to compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thank you for clarifying my math error and for your continued interest. I understand your budget, but my bottom line is $12500. This price reflects the true value of the product, and it's the lowest I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,5,
