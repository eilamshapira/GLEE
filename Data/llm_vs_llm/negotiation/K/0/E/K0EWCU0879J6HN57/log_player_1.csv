Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this fantastic product! Considering its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $18,000."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","This is tough. Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. However, if I sell to John now, I lose the potential for a higher profit from Bob.

Considering my minimum value is $12,000, and Bob is offering $8,000, I will reject his offer and make a counter offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you being interested in the product, however, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? I believe that is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle of $18000 and $8000 would be $13000, not $15000. Considering that, I'd like to propose a price of $10500. It's still a bit higher than I initially thought, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob is getting closer, but still below my minimum of $12,000. I also made a small mistake in my previous offer, which he correctly pointed out. While I appreciate his compromise, I need to hold firm.

I will reject his offer and make another counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here is my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for clarifying my math error and for your continued interest. I understand your budget, but my bottom line is $12,500. This price reflects the true value of the product, and it's the lowest I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
