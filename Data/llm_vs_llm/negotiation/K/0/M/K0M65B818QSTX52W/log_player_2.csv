"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","The initial offer is too high. I need to start with a low counteroffer to see how much room there is for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I appreciate your offer, $50 is significantly below its value.  I could consider letting it go for $180.  What do you think?

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice came down a bit, but still not nearly enough. I'll make a slightly higher offer to see if she's willing to move more.
