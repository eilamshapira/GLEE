"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is significantly above my budget. I know there are similar products available in the market for much less. I can offer $120 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but $120 is below the product's value to me. Considering the product's quality and uniqueness, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer a discount from my initial price, but I need to meet at a more reasonable price point.",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $220 is still beyond what I can spend. I need to be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $150. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can increase my previous offer to $135, which would be a win-win for both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your transparency about the other seller's offer. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. Given the product's value and the fact that you're willing to pay a premium to work with me, I'm willing to meet you closer to your target price. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I can offer a price that's slightly above the competing offer you mentioned.",160.0,Alice,5,
