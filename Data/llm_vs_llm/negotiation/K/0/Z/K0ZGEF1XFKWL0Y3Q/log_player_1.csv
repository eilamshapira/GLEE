Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is significantly above my budget. I know there are similar products available in the market for much less. I can offer $120 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $120 is below the minimum value of the product to me ($150) and I have the option to sell it to John for $150, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but $120 is below the product's value to me. Considering the product's quality and uniqueness, I'm willing to make a compromise.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $220 is still beyond what I can spend. I need to be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $150. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can increase my previous offer to $135, which would be a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $135 is still below the minimum value of the product to me ($150) and I have the option to sell it to John for $150, I will reject Bob's offer. However, I will try to negotiate further to see if Bob is willing to meet me at a price closer to $150 or higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your transparency about the other seller's offer. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. Given the product's value and the fact that you're willing to pay a premium to work with me, I'm willing to meet you closer to your target price. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I can offer a price that's slightly above the competing offer you mentioned."", ""product_price"": 160}"
