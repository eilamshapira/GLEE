Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. The product looks good, but I can only offer $85 for it. This is a fair price that gives you some profit while helping me stay within my budget constraints. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
