"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. How about you buy it for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to analyze whether accepting Alice's offer at $100 is a good deal.

The product is worth up to $120 to me, so Alice's offer of $100 is below my maximum value.
However, I might be able to negotiate a better price since the product is only worth $80 to Alice.

If I accept now, I'll pay $100.
If I buy from John, I'll pay $120, which is worse.
If I make a counteroffer, I might get a better price from Alice.

Given that there's room for negotiation (between $80 and $120), I should try to get a better price from Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. The product looks good, but I can only offer $85 for it. This is a fair price that gives you some profit while helping me stay within my budget constraints. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate it. How about we meet in the middle? I'd be willing to sell you the product for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'll evaluate this new offer from Alice:

- Alice is now offering $90, down from her initial $100
- The product is worth up to $120 to me, so this is well below my maximum
- The product is worth $80 to Alice, so she's still making a $10 profit
- John's price remains at $120, which is significantly higher

Alice has met me in the middle between her initial offer ($100) and my counteroffer ($85). This is a very reasonable compromise that gives both of us a good deal. I could try to negotiate further, but $90 is already a good price - I'm saving $30 compared to buying from John, and Alice is making a reasonable profit.
