"Bob, I'm excited to begin discussing the sale of this exceptional product with you. Given its unique qualities and the significant value it can bring, I'm initially offering it for $2000000.

"Alice, while I appreciate the unique qualities of the product, the initial price is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $600000, which I believe is a fair starting point given the value I can derive from it. Let me know your thoughts.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle closer to my floor? I can offer it for $1700000.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. However, $1700000 is still outside of my budget. I can increase my offer to $700000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer and reflects my serious interest in the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to come down further, but my bottom line is $1500000. I really cannot go any lower than that. It is a substantial reduction and I hope you appreciate that.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1500000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750000, which is my final offer before considering other options. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",750000.0,Bob,6,
