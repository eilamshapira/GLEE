"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its quality and features, I'm asking for $20000. I think it's a fair price that reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high.  It's much better to negotiate and see if she'll come down significantly, or go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me.  This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to be interested. How about $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a low offer to see how much Alice is willing to move on price. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below my $12,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10000 is significantly below its value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $17000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice came down a bit, $17,000 is still much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but staying firm below my $12,000 limit.  This puts the pressure on Alice to decide if she wants to make a deal or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a fair compromise here.  $11000 is still quite low, but I'm willing to go down to $15500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is holding firm at a price that's too high for me.  Even though it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above my $12,000 limit.  I'm better off going with John's guaranteed offer."
