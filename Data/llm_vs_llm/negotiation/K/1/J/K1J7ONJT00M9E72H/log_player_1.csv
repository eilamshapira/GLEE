"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product and I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start by making a high offer. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially settle on a higher price than if I started with a lower offer.

{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is higher than the minimum value I have for the product ($800,000), it's a good starting point for negotiations. However, I believe the product might be worth more to Bob, so I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob was willing to pay $1,000,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my initial offer, but still lower than what I think might be the maximum he's willing to pay. This will give me room to negotiate further and potentially get a better price.

{""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's new offer of $900,000 is lower than his previous offer of $1,000,000, which suggests that he might be trying to negotiate a better price. However, $900,000 is still higher than the minimum value I have for the product ($800,000), and I believe I can get a better price.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get closer to my target price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's last offer was $900,000, and his previous offer was $1,000,000, I'll try to meet him in the middle. I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than $900,000 but lower than $1,000,000, to see if we can find a mutually acceptable price.

{""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's new offer of $800,000 is the same as the minimum value I have for the product, and it's also the same price that John is willing to pay. At this point, I don't think I can get a better price from Bob, and I've already invested 6 rounds of negotiation.

Given that I can get the same price from John without further negotiation, I'll choose to sell the product to John to avoid the risk of further negotiation not yielding a better result.
