"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I should reject this offer since $1,150,000 is still quite high, and I have room to negotiate down. The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's significant room for a better price. Even if negotiations fail, I can still buy from John at $1,200,000, so I have nothing to lose by making a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that the product is worth $800,000 to Alice and my maximum value is $1,200,000, I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation. A fair initial counteroffer would be closer to Alice's cost plus a reasonable profit margin.

{""product_price"": 900000}

This offer would give Alice a $100,000 profit while still being significantly better for me than both Alice's initial offer and John's price. It's low enough to leave room for negotiation but not so low as to be insulting or unreasonable given Alice's known costs."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has lowered her price by $50,000, showing willingness to negotiate. However, there's still significant room between her cost ($800,000) and this offer ($1,100,000). Since I have the backup option of John at $1,200,000, I can afford to continue negotiating for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down $50,000 from her initial offer, I'll raise my previous offer to show good faith in the negotiation. I'll increase my previous offer of $900,000 by a reasonable amount.

{""product_price"": 950000}

This offer would still give Alice a healthy $150,000 profit while being significantly better than both her current offer and John's price. It shows I'm willing to move up from my initial position while still maintaining a strong negotiating position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her price again by $50,000, showing consistent movement in the negotiation. She's now offering $1,050,000, which is $150,000 less than her initial offer. While this is progress, there's still room for negotiation since this would give her a $250,000 profit. Since we're moving closer to a middle ground and I still have John's offer as a backup, I'll continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has shown consistent movement by reducing her price by $50,000 each time, and I increased my last offer by $50,000, I'll continue this pattern of convergence by making another significant increase to my offer.

{""product_price"": 1000000}

This offer represents a fair middle ground. It would give Alice a $200,000 profit (25% profit margin), which is reasonable, while still being significantly better than both her current offer and John's price. It also shows I'm willing to make substantial movements in the negotiation to reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has now reduced her price to $1,030,000, showing smaller increments of reduction ($20,000 this time). This offer would give her a $230,000 profit. We're getting closer to a fair price, and the smaller reduction suggests we're nearing her bottom line. Given that:

1. The gap between our positions has narrowed significantly
2. This price is $170,000 better than John's offer
3. We've had several rounds of negotiation with diminishing improvements
4. There's risk in pushing too hard and potentially losing the deal

I'll accept this offer.
