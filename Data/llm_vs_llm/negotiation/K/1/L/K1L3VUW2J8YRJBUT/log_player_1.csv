"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its worth."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm and understand the value of the product. However, my budget is a bit tight. I'm willing to offer $7000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $7,000 is below my minimum threshold of $8,000, I will reject his offer. I still believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that budget can be a constraint, but I still believe the product's value is higher than your offer. I'm willing to compromise, but not that much. I can offer you a slight discount from my initial price."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I really appreciate your willingness to compromise. My budget is limited and the best I can offer is $8000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","This is an interesting turn of events. Bob's new offer of $8,000 is exactly the same as John's offer, and it's also the minimum price I'm willing to accept.

In this case, I don't see any advantage in continuing to negotiate with Bob, as I can get the same price from John without any further risk or effort.
