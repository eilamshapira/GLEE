"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price offered by Alice ($120) is above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). It would be irrational to accept this offer. Since I can buy from John for $80, I should either make a counteroffer to Alice or buy from John. I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if I can get an even better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

I'll offer $70, which is below John's price of $80. This gives room for negotiation while potentially saving me money compared to buying from John. Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, there's a possibility she might accept a price above her cost but below John's price, which would benefit both of us. If Alice rejects this offer, we can continue negotiating, or I always have the option to buy from John at $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $110 is still well above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). There's no reason to accept this offer when I can get the product for $80 from John. I'll reject and continue negotiating with Alice to see if she'll come down to a more reasonable price, knowing that I always have the option to buy from John at $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 75}

I'll increase my offer slightly to $75, which is still below John's price of $80. This shows some movement in the negotiation while still giving me a better deal than John's offer if Alice accepts. Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, she would still make a $25 profit at this price. If she rejects this offer, I can either continue negotiating or take John's offer of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice continues to offer prices well above John's price of $80, and she hasn't shown significant movement toward a reasonable price (only dropping from $120 to $105). Since I know I can get the product for $80 from John, and that's already my maximum value for the product, it makes more sense to end the negotiation with Alice and buy from John. There's no indication that Alice will drop her price below $80, and continuing to negotiate would just waste time when I have a guaranteed acceptable option available."
