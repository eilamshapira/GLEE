"Hi Alice, $250 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $125. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. However, $125 is below my minimum price. I can go as low as $200 for this product. Let me know if that works for you.",200.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is still below my minimum. I can come down to $165, which is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",165.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. My final offer before considering other options is $160. This is the lowest I can go while still valuing the product appropriately. Let me know if you can meet me at this price.",160.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $150, which is my absolute limit. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider my other options.",150.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $150. That works for me, and I'm happy to sell the product to you at that price. Let's proceed with the transaction.",,Alice,6,AcceptOffer
