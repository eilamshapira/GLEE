"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I think $150 is too high. I'm willing to pay $40 for the product. What do you think?",40.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, $40 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  What do you say?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $120 is still too high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $50. Would you consider this?",50.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $50 is just not realistic.  I'm going to have to stick with $110. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price. I'm willing to come down to $105, but I'm not going any lower.  If you're not interested, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",105.0,Alice,7,
