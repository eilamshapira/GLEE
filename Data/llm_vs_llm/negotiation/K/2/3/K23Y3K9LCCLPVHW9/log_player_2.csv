"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $13,500 is higher than I'm willing to pay ($12,000), and I have the option to buy from John at $12,000, I'll reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to see if we can negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm willing to pay up to $12,000, I'll offer $11,000 to see how Alice responds.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $12,500 is still higher than I'm willing to pay, and it's also higher than the price John is offering ($12,000). Since I can get the product from John for $12,000, which is within my budget, I don't see a reason to pay more to Alice.
