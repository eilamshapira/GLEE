"Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I should evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $17,000, but it's only worth $10,000 to me. Additionally, I have the option to buy from John for $10,000 at any time.

Since Alice's offer ($17,000) exceeds the maximum I value the product at ($10,000), and also exceeds John's price ($10,000), I should not accept Alice's offer.

I could make a counteroffer, but since John is already offering the product at my maximum valuation, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice unless I believe she would accept a price significantly below $10,000.

The most economical decision is to buy from John.
