"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This is a strong opening offer that leaves room for negotiation while still reflecting the value of the product to me.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value and potentially counter with a lower offer, giving us a starting point for a productive discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value for the product.  While I need to be careful with this negotiation, I won't accept an offer that undervalues the product. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, but still reflecting the value of the product. I believe this offer is fair and gives Bob a reasonable opportunity to come closer to my expectations."
