"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze this situation:

- The product is worth at most $1,500,000 to me
- Alice is offering the product for $1,400,000
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $1,500,000

Since Alice's offer ($1,400,000) is lower than John's price ($1,500,000), and both are within my maximum valuation, I should accept Alice's offer to save $100,000.
