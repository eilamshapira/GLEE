(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, let's analyze. Bob is now offering $105, John offers $120, and my minimum value is $120.

I need to make a decision that earns me the most money. Selling to John guarantees $120, which is the minimum acceptable amount. Accepting Bob's offer now would result in a loss.
