(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's price ($1,200,000), and this is the maximum I'm willing to pay, I should reject and make a lower counteroffer. There's no downside to negotiating with Alice since I can always fall back on John's offer later.
