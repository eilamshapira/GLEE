Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my options carefully. I have a product worth at least $150 to me, and Bob values it at $100. If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell to John for a guaranteed $150.

Since Bob values the product at $100, he won't pay more than that. If I offer Bob any price above $100, he will rationally reject my offer, and I'll sell to John for $150. If I offer Bob exactly $100, he might accept, but I'd be earning $50 less than my alternative.

Therefore, the economically rational decision is to offer Bob a price that ensures he rejects it, allowing me to sell to John for $150.
