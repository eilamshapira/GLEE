"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an exclusive product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $1200000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you know you can buy the product from John for $1,200,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at the same price. You might be able to get a better deal by rejecting and seeing if Alice counters with a lower price."
