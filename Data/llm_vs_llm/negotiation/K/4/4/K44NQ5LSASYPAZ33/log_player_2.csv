"Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer is $22,000, which is more expensive than John's offer of $15,000, and the product is worth no more than $15,000 to you, the logical choice would be to buy from John instead.
