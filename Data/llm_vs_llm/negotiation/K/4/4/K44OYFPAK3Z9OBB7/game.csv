"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $200 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I know the product's value and I can get it elsewhere for a lower price. I can offer you $70 for it.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I can't go as low as $70, I could come down to $180. This is a significant reduction and a fair price for the quality of this product.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down in price, Alice, but $180 is still much higher than what I can afford. I should be transparent - I can get this product elsewhere for $80, and that's really my maximum budget. I can offer you $75, which is close to my limit.",75.0,Bob,4,
