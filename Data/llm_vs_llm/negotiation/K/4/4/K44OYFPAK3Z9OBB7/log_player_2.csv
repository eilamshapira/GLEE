"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $200. It's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $200 is way above my maximum value of $80. It's better to reject this offer and make a counteroffer, or potentially buy from John if negotiations don't improve. Since John is willing to sell at $80 (my maximum value), that's my backup option, but let me try negotiating with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $200 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I know the product's value and I can get it elsewhere for a lower price. I can offer you $70 for it."", ""product_price"": 70}

I'm starting with a lower offer because:
1. It gives room for negotiation
2. I know my maximum value is $80
3. I have John's offer of $80 as a backup
4. Starting low allows us to potentially meet at a price that works for both of us

Let's see how Alice responds to this counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I can't go as low as $70, I could come down to $180. This is a significant reduction and a fair price for the quality of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $180 is still way above my maximum value of $80. While Alice did reduce the price, it's still more than double what I'm willing to pay. Since John's offer of $80 is still available and matches my maximum value, I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer. If Alice doesn't come down significantly, I'll go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down in price, Alice, but $180 is still much higher than what I can afford. I should be transparent - I can get this product elsewhere for $80, and that's really my maximum budget. I can offer you $75, which is close to my limit."", ""product_price"": 75}

I'm being more direct in this counteroffer because:
1. I've mentioned the competing offer of $80
2. I'm showing I'm willing to pay slightly less than my alternative option
3. I'm being honest about my maximum budget
4. If Alice doesn't come close to this price point, I can always go with John's offer

This gives Alice clear information about my alternatives and might help her make a more realistic counteroffer. If she still stays well above $80, I'll need to go with John's offer."
