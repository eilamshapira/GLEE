,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is well above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and needs, I would be willing to pay $8000 for it. This is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $18000 may be out of your budget, but $8000 is below my acceptable price range. I'm willing to compromise and find a middle ground. Considering the product's value and your interest, I'd like to propose a new price.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice, but $16000 is still far above what I can justify spending. I understand you need to make a profit, but I've seen similar products in the market for much less. I can increase my offer to $9000, which I believe is more reasonable given market conditions.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $9000. I understand that you're looking for a fair market price, and I'm trying to be flexible. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a reasonable return on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new offer. Let's try to find a compromise at $14500.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground, Alice. Your willingness to negotiate is encouraging. However, $14500 is still significantly above what I can justify spending. I've done extensive market research, and I know there are similar products available for less. I can offer $9800, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer and reflects the maximum value I can see in this product.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your latest offer of $9800 and the effort you've put into researching the market. However, I still need to prioritize the product's value to me. Considering your willingness to negotiate and the time we've invested in this discussion, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I can offer the product to you for $13500, which is a significant concession from my initial price. This is as low as I'm comfortable going while still ensuring I'm getting a fair deal.",13500.0,Alice,7,
