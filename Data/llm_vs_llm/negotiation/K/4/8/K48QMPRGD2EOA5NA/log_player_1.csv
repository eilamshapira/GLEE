Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is well above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and needs, I would be willing to pay $8000 for it. This is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $8,000 because it's significantly lower than the product's value to me. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. My next step will be to send a counteroffer to Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 may be out of your budget, but $8,000 is below my acceptable price range.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice, but $16000 is still far above what I can justify spending. I understand you need to make a profit, but I've seen similar products in the market for much less. I can increase my offer to $9000, which I believe is more reasonable given market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $9,000 because it's still below my minimum acceptable price. Although Bob has increased his offer, it doesn't meet my requirements. I'll send another counteroffer to try to bridge the gap between our prices."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $9,000. I understand that you're looking for a fair market price, and I'm trying to be flexible. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a reasonable return on the product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground, Alice. Your willingness to negotiate is encouraging. However, $14500 is still significantly above what I can justify spending. I've done extensive market research, and I know there are similar products available for less. I can offer $9800, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer and reflects the maximum value I can see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $9,800 because it's still below my minimum acceptable price. Although Bob has increased his offer again and claims it's the maximum value he can see in the product, I believe the product is worth more. I'll send another counteroffer to try to get closer to a price that works for me."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your latest offer of $9,800 and the effort you've put into researching the market. However, I still need to prioritize the product's value to me. Considering your willingness to negotiate and the time we've invested in this discussion, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I can offer the product to you for $13,500, which is a significant concession from my initial price. This is as low as I'm comfortable going while still ensuring I'm getting a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
