"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $15000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I need to consider the true value of this premium item. I can come down from my initial offer to $18500. This represents a significant discount from my original price while still reflecting the quality and value of the product. Would you be able to meet me at this price?",18500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $18500 is still a little out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $16000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see we're making progress in our negotiation. I appreciate your increased offer of $16000, which shows your genuine interest in the product. After careful consideration, I can offer it to you for $17500. This represents a substantial reduction from my initial asking price and I believe it's a fair compromise that acknowledges both your budget constraints and the true value of this premium product. Would this work for you?",17500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit higher than my ideal price point.  I'm prepared to offer $16500. This is a good compromise, and hopefully we can close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",16500.0,Bob,6,

This is very close to your last offer and represents a significant reduction from my original price. At this price point, you're getting exceptional value for a premium product. I hope we can finalize the deal at this amount.",17000.0,Alice,7,
