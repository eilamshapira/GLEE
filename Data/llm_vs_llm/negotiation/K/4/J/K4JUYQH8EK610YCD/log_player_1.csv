Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","This is a tough spot! Bob's offering significantly less than the product is worth to me. However, I still have several rounds to negotiate. Selling to John guarantees $100, which is better than $90. Let's see if I can get Bob to budge.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Hmm, $97 is getting closer, but it's still less than what I could get from John. However, I'm still confident I can get a better deal with Bob. I also have time.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not quite there. To be fair, consider that I'm giving you a great deal as it is worth $120 to you. How about..."", ""product_price"": 102}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you be willing to meet me at $99? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","This is a tough one. $99 is so close to what I can get from John. I also have a feeling that Bob will not go much higher than this. I need to think fast. I also have a few rounds remaining. I could risk another round and try to get to $100, but if Bob doesn't budge, I'd be losing out. Given that it's more beneficial to close the deal with John, in case things go south.
