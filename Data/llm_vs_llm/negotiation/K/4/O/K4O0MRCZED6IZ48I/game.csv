"Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $5000000 is far above what I can justify. I have another opportunity available, so to move forward quickly, I'm counteroffering $1000000. I believe this is a fair starting point given market conditions. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $5000000 might have been too high, but $1000000 is lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's unique value and the market conditions, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's discuss a price that reflects the product's true worth.",3000000.0,Alice,3,
