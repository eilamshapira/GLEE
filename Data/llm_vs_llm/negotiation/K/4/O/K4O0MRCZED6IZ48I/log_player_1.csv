"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has tremendous value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 5000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $5000000 is far above what I can justify. I have another opportunity available, so to move forward quickly, I'm counteroffering $1000000. I believe this is a fair starting point given market conditions. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the minimum value the product is worth to me ($1,000,000), and I have the option to sell it to John for the same price, I don't see a benefit in accepting Bob's offer over selling to John. However, I also don't want to give up on the potential of negotiating a higher price with Bob. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer, hoping to find a middle ground or a higher price that benefits me more.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $5,000,000 might have been too high, but $1,000,000 is lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's unique value and the market conditions, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's discuss a price that reflects the product's true worth."", ""product_price"": 3000000}"
