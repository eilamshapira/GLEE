"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product I think you'd be really interested in. I'm offering it to you for $250. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $250.
2. The product is worth no more than $150 to me.
3. I can buy the same product from John for $150.

Since Alice's offer ($250) exceeds both the value of the product to me and the price at which I can get it from John, the rational decision is to not accept Alice's offer.

Between the remaining options, buying from John for $150 is the best choice since it allows me to get the product at a price that matches my maximum valuation.
