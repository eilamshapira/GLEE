"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is only slightly below my maximum price. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal. I'm willing to risk going to the next round to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a strong counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's opening offer. This gives us room to negotiate, and it signals that I'm serious about getting a good price. I believe it's still a profitable offer for Alice, as it's $1,000 more than her product's worth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but I think there's still room for improvement. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice came down $1000 from her initial offer, so I am willing to come up $500 from mine. This shows I am willing to negotiate, but also that I am sticking to my goal of getting a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down another $500, meeting me halfway between our previous offers. This seems like a fair compromise. It's a significant savings compared to John's price, and further haggling might risk the deal."
