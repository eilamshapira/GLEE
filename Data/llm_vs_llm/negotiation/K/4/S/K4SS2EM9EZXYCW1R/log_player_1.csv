Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is a bit higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I will reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still above my minimum, showing flexibility while still maintaining a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum.  Selling to John guarantees a solid profit, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to an even lower offer."
