Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer, but I find $1800000 to be significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, which is the same price I can get from John. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. I can offer you $800000 for the product, which would save me some money while still providing you with a quick sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you've reduced your offer, which I appreciate. However, I need to emphasize that this product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I can purchase it from John at exactly that price. To make it worthwhile for me to buy from you instead, I need a better deal. I'm willing to offer you $900000, which gives you a quick sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

""message"": ""Bob, I see your point about the alternative option.  Let's try to bridge this gap.  How about we settle at $1,200,000?  This represents a significant movement from my initial ask and would still offer you a better overall value proposition than John can provide in the long run."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price. However, I must be very clear: this product has a maximum value of $1000000 to me, which is exactly what John is offering. There's no additional long-term value proposition that would justify paying more than $1000000. In fact, to make it worth my while to continue this negotiation rather than simply going with John's offer, I need a better price. I'm willing to pay $950000, which is nearly at my maximum valuation but still gives me some benefit for choosing to work with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and respect your firm stance.  While I believe the product's inherent value exceeds $1,000,000, I value a successful and mutually beneficial outcome.  Therefore, I propose a final offer of $1,100,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial asking price and only slightly exceeds your maximum, but it acknowledges the unique advantages this product holds for you."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to reach an agreement, but I need to be completely straightforward with you. I cannot and will not pay more than $1000000 for this product - that is my absolute maximum valuation, and coincidentally, it's exactly what John is offering. There are no unique advantages that would justify paying more than my maximum valuation. My final offer is $975000. This gives you a quick sale and is very close to my maximum, while still providing me with a small benefit for choosing you over John. If we can't agree on this price or lower, I'll have no choice but to purchase from John at $1000000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
