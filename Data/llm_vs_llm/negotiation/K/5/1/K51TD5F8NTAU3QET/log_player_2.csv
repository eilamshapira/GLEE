(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me. Alice is offering it for $1,500,000. I will reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a better price. Buying from John for $1,000,000 is better than accepting Alice's current offer.
