"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product! I'm asking $25000 for it.",25000.0,Alice,1,,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $25000 is well beyond my budget. The product is only worth about $7000 to me based on my research of comparable items. Additionally, I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $10000. I'd like to buy from you if possible, so I'm offering $7000. This is a fair price that still gives you a reasonable profit while meeting my budget constraints.",7000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $10000 (considering selling to John). I will counteroffer.
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you have a budget in mind, and I'd still prefer to sell to you. Based on the product's unique qualities, I can't go as low as $7000. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000.",18000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $18000 is still well above what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, I have a firm offer from John for $10000, and that's really the ceiling on what I can justify spending. Given that you'd like to make the sale, I'm willing to offer $8500. This gives you a better deal than simply matching John's price, while still being within my budget constraints. Let me know if we can make this work.",8500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $10000. I will counteroffer.
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I also need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique product. Given your offer and John's offer of $10000, I'm willing to come down further to $12000. This is the lowest I can go. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you bringing your price down to $12000, which shows your willingness to negotiate. However, as I've mentioned, I have a firm offer from John at $10000, and the product is worth no more than that amount to me. If you can match John's price of $10000, I'd be happy to buy from you instead. This is truly the maximum I can spend for this product based on both its value to me and my alternative option.",10000.0,Bob,6,,
