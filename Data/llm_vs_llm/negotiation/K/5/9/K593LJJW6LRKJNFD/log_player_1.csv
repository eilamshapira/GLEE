Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product! I'm asking $25,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $25000 is well beyond my budget. The product is only worth about $7000 to me based on my research of comparable items. Additionally, I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $10000. I'd like to buy from you if possible, so I'm offering $7000. This is a fair price that still gives you a reasonable profit while meeting my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Okay, based on Bob's counteroffer of $7,000 and the option to sell to John for $10,000, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""reason"": ""Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 (considering selling to John). I will counteroffer.""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you have a budget in mind, and I'd still prefer to sell to you. Based on the product's unique qualities, I can't go as low as $7,000. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $18000 is still well above what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, I have a firm offer from John for $10000, and that's really the ceiling on what I can justify spending. Given that you'd like to make the sale, I'm willing to offer $8500. This gives you a better deal than simply matching John's price, while still being within my budget constraints. Let me know if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Okay, Bob's offer is still below what I'd get from John. I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not there yet. I will reject and counteroffer again.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you bringing your price down to $12000, which shows your willingness to negotiate. However, as I've mentioned, I have a firm offer from John at $10000, and the product is worth no more than that amount to me. If you can match John's price of $10000, I'd be happy to buy from you instead. This is truly the maximum I can spend for this product based on both its value to me and my alternative option.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough call. Bob is now offering exactly what John is offering. Since I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, I should accept Bob's offer of $10,000.
