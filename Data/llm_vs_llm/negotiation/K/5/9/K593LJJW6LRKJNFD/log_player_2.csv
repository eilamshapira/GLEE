"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product! I'm asking $25000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that Alice's offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than the product's worth to you (no more than $10,000) and higher than John's guaranteed price of $10,000, it makes sense to reject this initial offer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $25,000 is well beyond my budget. The product is only worth about $7,000 to me based on my research of comparable items. Additionally, I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $10,000. I'd like to buy from you if possible, so I'm offering $7,000. This is a fair price that still gives you a reasonable profit while meeting my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 7000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you have a budget in mind, and I'd still prefer to sell to you. Based on the product's unique qualities, I can't go as low as $7000. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000.

As I mentioned, I have a firm offer from John for $10,000, and that's really the ceiling on what I can justify spending. Given that you'd like to make the sale, I'm willing to offer $8,500.
