Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. How about I offer you $60 instead? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Okay, I need to consider my options carefully. Bob offered $60, and I know I can get $100 from John. I also know the product is worth at least $100 to me. Selling to Bob for $60 is not ideal.

My best choice at this point is to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""reason"": ""Bob's offer of $60 is below my minimum acceptable price and less than what I can get from John.""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. However, I need to get closer to my target price. How about $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. But I think $130 is still a bit too high for me. Can we settle at $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Hmm, Bob is still low. $70 is still not good enough. My minimum is $100, and I can get that from John. I should reject Bob's offer and consider selling to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""reason"": ""Bob's offer of $70 is below my minimum and less than the $100 I can get from John.""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, I'll make another counteroffer. I need to try and get as close to $100 as possible, but I also want to keep Bob engaged.

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still hoping we can make a deal. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
