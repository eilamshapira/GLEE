"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $150 is higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. If the negotiation doesn't work out, I can always fall back on John's offer of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 75}

I'll offer $75 for the product. This is a reasonable counteroffer because:
1. It's well below John's price of $100, giving room for negotiation
2. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $150, but not so low as to be insulting
3. If Alice rejects this offer, we can still negotiate upward while staying below the $100 maximum I'm willing to pay
4. If negotiations fail, I still have the option to buy from John at $100"
