"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $18,000 against my alternatives.

Given that:
- The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
- John is offering the same product for $12,000
- Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than both my valuation and John's price

There's no reason for me to accept Alice's offer of $18,000. I could either make a counteroffer to Alice or buy from John immediately.

Since I have the option to buy from John at any time, and that price matches my maximum valuation, I should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price before potentially going with John's option.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and I have the option to buy from John at $12,000, I'll start with a lower offer to Alice to see if we can agree on a better price than John's offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has lowered her price from $18,000 to $16,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this price is still higher than both my maximum valuation of $12,000 and John's fixed price of $12,000.

There's no reason for me to accept a price higher than what John is offering, so I should reject Alice's current offer and either try one more counteroffer or go with John's option.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has come down from $18,000 to $16,000, showing she's willing to negotiate, but still well above John's price of $12,000. I'll make a counteroffer below John's price but higher than my previous offer to show I'm also flexible.

{""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has lowered her price again to $15,000, which shows continued willingness to negotiate. However, this price is still $3,000 higher than John's offer of $12,000, and the product is only worth a maximum of $12,000 to me.

Since Alice's price remains above my maximum valuation and John's alternative, I should reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has continued to lower her price, moving from $18,000 to $16,000 to $15,000. This suggests she may be willing to go lower, but we're still above John's price of $12,000. I'll increase my offer slightly to show good faith in the negotiation while staying below my maximum value.

{""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has lowered her price to $14,000, showing continued willingness to negotiate downward. However, this is still $2,000 higher than John's offer of $12,000, and my maximum valuation for the product is $12,000.

Given that we're now in Round 7 of 10, and Alice seems to be decreasing her price by approximately $1,000 each round, it's unlikely she'll go below John's price within our remaining rounds.

Since I can get the same product from John at a price that matches my maximum valuation, and Alice's price remains above that alternative, the rational choice is:
