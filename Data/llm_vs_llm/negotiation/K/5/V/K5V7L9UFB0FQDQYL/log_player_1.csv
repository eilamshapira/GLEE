Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic decision here. I want to maximize my earnings from selling this product. 

The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at exactly that amount. This gives me a solid floor for my negotiation with Bob.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I need to set a price that's high enough to give me good profit but not so high that Bob immediately rejects it. I should aim for a reasonable premium above my floor price.
