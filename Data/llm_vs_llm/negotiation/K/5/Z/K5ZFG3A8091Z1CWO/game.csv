"Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe will be of great value to you. Based on its quality and features, I'm offering it at a price of $18500. This is a competitive price for a product of this caliber. I'm open to discussing this further if needed.",18500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18500 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $10000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, I need to clarify that my minimum acceptable price is $10000, as I have another buyer (John) ready to purchase at that price point. Given the product's quality and market value, I believe a fair price would be $15000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while reflecting the true value of the product. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a price that works for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $15000 is still too high for me. Given that you mentioned a minimum of $10000 and considering my budget constraints, I'm willing to increase my offer to $11000. This is the best I can do at the moment. Let me know if we can close the deal at this price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
