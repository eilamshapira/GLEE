Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, I need to clarify that my minimum acceptable price is $10,000, as I have another buyer (John) ready to purchase at that price point. Given the product's quality and market value, I believe a fair price would be $15,000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while reflecting the true value of the product. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Given that you mentioned a minimum of $10000 and considering my budget constraints, I'm willing to increase my offer to $11000. This is the best I can do at the moment. Let me know if we can close the deal at this price.
