Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, I need to clarify that my minimum acceptable price is $10000, as I have another buyer (John) ready to purchase at that price point. Given the product's quality and market value, I believe a fair price would be $15000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while reflecting the true value of the product. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $15,000 is still too high for me. Given that you mentioned a minimum of $10,000 and considering my budget constraints, I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,000. This is the best I can do at the moment. Let me know if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
