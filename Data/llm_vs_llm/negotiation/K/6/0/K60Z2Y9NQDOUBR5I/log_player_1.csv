"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Let me think strategically about this situation. The product is worth $120 to me, and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $120. I know the product is only worth $80 to Bob, but I'll start high and see if we can negotiate.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $60 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I have a guaranteed offer from John at $120, it wouldn't make sense to accept Bob's low offer. Given that Bob values the product at only $80, and his first counter-offer is very low at $60, it seems unlikely we'll reach a deal that's better than John's offer. The rational decision is to take the guaranteed $120 from John.
