"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I find the price to be quite high. I am looking to spend no more than $1000000. Could you consider this price point?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, I need to emphasize that this product has significant value. My bottom line is $1000000, which happens to match your offer, but I believe the product is worth more given its features and potential. I can come down to $1500000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of what you'd be acquiring.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I need to stick to my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $600000 to meet you in the middle. How does this price sound to you?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle, but I must point out that your offer of $600000 is actually below your initial offer of $1000000, not in the middle. This product is worth at minimum $1000000 to me, which is why I cannot accept anything below that figure. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, which represents a significant $500000 reduction from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering the value you'll be receiving.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
