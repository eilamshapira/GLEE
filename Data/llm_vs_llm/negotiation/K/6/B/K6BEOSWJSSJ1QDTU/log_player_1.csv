Round 2
Bob's offer:

While I understand your budget constraints, I need to emphasize that this product has significant value. My bottom line is $1,000,000, which happens to match your offer, but I believe the product is worth more given its features and potential. I can come down to $1,500,000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of what you'd be acquiring."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle, but I must point out that your offer of $600,000 is actually below your initial offer of $1,000,000, not in the middle. This product is worth at minimum $1,000,000 to me, which is why I cannot accept anything below that figure. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, which represents a significant $500,000 reduction from my initial offer.
