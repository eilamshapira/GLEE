"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Considering its unique qualities and potential, I believe a fair price would be $2500000. What do you think?",2500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $2500000 is quite high for my budget. Considering my constraints, I'm willing to offer $400000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you're considering my offer. However, $400000 is far below the product's true value and my minimum acceptable price. I am willing to go down a bit, but I can't go that low. Considering this, how about we meet in the middle at $2250000?",2250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm afraid $2250000 is still beyond what I'm willing to pay. I can offer $600000, which I believe is a fair consideration given my budgetary constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still confident in the value of this product. $600000 is not acceptable. Let's try this, how about we settle on $2000000? This represents a significant drop from my initial offer.",2000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2000000 is still much higher than I'm willing to pay. How about $700000? I hope this offer is closer to what we both can agree on.",700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I understand your position, I can't go that low. The value of this product is much higher. I propose a final offer of $1800000. This is my absolute lowest price. Please consider it carefully.",1800000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really value this negotiation and understand that $1800000 is your final price. Unfortunately, it's far beyond what I am comfortable investing. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750000. I hope we can close this deal at this price point.",750000.0,Bob,8,
