"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's first offer is quite high. While it's below my maximum budget, there's a good chance I can negotiate a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a strong counteroffer that's still significantly above Alice's value for the product. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling that I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice came down $100,000, but that's still not a compelling offer. I believe continued negotiation will lead to a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my previous counter-offer. Let's see how Alice responds."
