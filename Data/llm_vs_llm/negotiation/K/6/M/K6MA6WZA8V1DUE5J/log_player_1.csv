"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that Bob values the product at $800,000 and my minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000, there isn't actually a zone of possible agreement between us. However, I'll start with a high offer to see if there's any flexibility in Bob's valuation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer of $650,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Since I can sell to John for $1,200,000, and Bob's initial counteroffer is so low (even below his own valuation of $800,000), it seems unlikely we'll reach a mutually beneficial agreement. The rational decision is to sell to John.
