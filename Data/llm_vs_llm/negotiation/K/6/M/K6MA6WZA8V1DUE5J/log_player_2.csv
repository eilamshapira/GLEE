"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given the offer, I need to make a strategic decision:

1. Alice's offer ($1,500,000) is significantly higher than my maximum valuation ($800,000)
2. Alice's offer is also much higher than John's alternative offer ($800,000)
3. The product is worth more to Alice ($1,200,000) than John's price, so there might be room for negotiation

Since Alice's initial offer is extremely high (almost double my maximum valuation), and John offers exactly my maximum valuation, I should reject Alice's offer and attempt to negotiate.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that acknowledges the product's value while trying to find a price better than John's alternative.
