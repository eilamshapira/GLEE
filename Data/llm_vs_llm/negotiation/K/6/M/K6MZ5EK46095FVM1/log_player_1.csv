Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I was hoping to spend less on this product. Would you consider selling it for $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price. My counteroffer is $17,000. This is still below my initial offer but closer to my minimum acceptable price, considering Bob's initial counteroffer was quite low. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to spend less, but $8,000 is below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. Would you consider $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I am looking to spend less then $9000 for this product. Would you accept $9500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price and is now offering $9,500, I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my previous counteroffer of $17,000, but also considering I have a better option with John at $15,000, I won't go too low.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make a significant concession from my previous offer. Would you consider $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
