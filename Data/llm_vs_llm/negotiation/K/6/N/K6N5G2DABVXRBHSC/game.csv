"Bob, I'm excited to begin negotiations with you on this unique opportunity. Given its rarity and potential value to you, I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. Let's start with this: ",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1900000 is significantly above my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm prepared to offer $1000000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, allowing for a profitable transaction while staying within my financial constraints.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. While $1000000 is lower than I'm willing to go right now, I am willing to come down from my initial price. How about we meet in the middle, closer to the true value, and consider a price of $1750000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1750000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1250000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us, considering the value you placed on the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I acknowledge your increased offer. However, selling at $1250000 would be difficult for me. Let's try to find a price point that works for both of us. How about $1650000?",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1650000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1400000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a profitable deal.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
