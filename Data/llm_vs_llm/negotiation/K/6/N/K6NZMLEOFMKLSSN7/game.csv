"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price seems a bit steep for my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000, considering the market value and my own financial constraints.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, given the product's unique benefits and the significant advantage it can provide, I believe that a price of $900000 is more reasonable. This ensures that you're still getting a great deal while acknowledging the product's true value.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. Considering my budget and the fact that I have an alternative option from John for $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. I'd like to propose a price of $750000.",750000.0,Bob,4,
