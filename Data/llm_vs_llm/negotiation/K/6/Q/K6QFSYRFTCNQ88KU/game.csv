,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. Considering my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm prepared to offer $8500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is lower than I'm comfortable with. This product has significant value and I know you'll see it in the long run. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $13500.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value this product highly, but $13500 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This shows my sincere interest in purchasing from you. Let's meet in the middle, and I'm sure we can finalize this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I hope it demonstrates my serious interest in buying your product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,6,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $11750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11500.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",11500.0,Bob,8,
