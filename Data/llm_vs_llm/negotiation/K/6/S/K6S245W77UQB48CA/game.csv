"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. Based on the quality and benefits this product provides, I'm offering it to you for $14000. This is a competitive price for something worth $15000 to you, allowing you to gain $1000 in value while also providing me with a fair return. Would you like to proceed with this purchase?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this proposal.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $12500 is lower than I can accept given the product's value. The product provides $15000 worth of value to you, and I'm willing to meet you partway. I can offer it for $13500, which still gives you a substantial $1500 in value while allowing me a reasonable return. This is a fair compromise that benefits us both. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I was thinking we could meet closer to the middle ground. Considering the product's value to both of us, I'd like to propose a price of $13000. This way, we can both benefit from the transaction, and I'll still be gaining a substantial value from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",13000.0,Bob,4,
