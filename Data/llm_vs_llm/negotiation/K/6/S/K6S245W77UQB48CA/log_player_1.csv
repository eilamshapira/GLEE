Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this proposal.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $12,500 is lower than I can accept given the product's value. The product provides $15,000 worth of value to you, and I'm willing to meet you partway. I can offer it for $13,500, which still gives you a substantial $1,500 in value while allowing me a reasonable return. This is a fair compromise that benefits us both.

This way, we can both benefit from the transaction, and I'll still be gaining a substantial value from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.
