Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $12500 is lower than I can accept given the product's value. The product provides $15000 worth of value to you, and I'm willing to meet you partway. I can offer it for $13500, which still gives you a substantial $1500 in value while allowing me a reasonable return. This is a fair compromise that benefits us both. What do you think?
