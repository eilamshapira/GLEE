"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze this situation:

- Alice is offering the product for $1,100,000
- The product is worth up to $1,200,000 to me
- I can buy from John for $1,200,000 anytime
- If I reject, I can make a counteroffer to Alice

Alice's offer is already $100,000 less than John's price, which saves me money. However, since I can make a counteroffer, it makes sense to try negotiating for an even better price before accepting or going to John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's lower than Alice's $1,100,000 but still gives her a good profit margin above her $800,000 cost.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I see that Alice has reduced her offer from $1,100,000 to $1,000,000, which is a good improvement. This is now $200,000 less than John's price of $1,200,000. 

While I could try negotiating further, Alice has already shown willingness to move on price, and $1,000,000 represents a fair deal for both of us - she makes a $200,000 profit above her $800,000 cost, and I save $200,000 compared to buying from John.

This seems like a reasonable middle ground, so I'll accept this offer.
