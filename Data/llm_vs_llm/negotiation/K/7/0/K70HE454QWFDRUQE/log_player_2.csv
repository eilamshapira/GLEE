"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given the information, I need to make a decision between accepting Alice's offer at $12,000, rejecting Alice's offer, or buying from John at $12,000.

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and Alice is offering it at exactly $12,000. John is also offering the same product at $12,000.

Since both offers are identical at $12,000, I'm indifferent between accepting Alice's offer or buying from John. However, since the question provides ""BuyFromJhon"" as a distinct option, I'll choose that.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
