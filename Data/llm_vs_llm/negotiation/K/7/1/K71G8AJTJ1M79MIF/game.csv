"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand that we need to find a price that works for both of us. The product holds significant value, so I'm willing to lower my price to $1800000. Let me know if this is more in line with your budget.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for lowering the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1800000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1150000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
