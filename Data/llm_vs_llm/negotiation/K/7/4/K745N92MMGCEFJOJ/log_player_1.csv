"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair price."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. Your product seems interesting, but I was hoping to spend a bit less. Would you consider $90 for the product? This would be a fair price that works within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $90 is lower than my initial offer, and I believe the product is worth more. Selling to John for $80 is also not an option at this point, as I can potentially get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still believe the product is worth more than $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's try $105."", ""product_price"": 105}"
