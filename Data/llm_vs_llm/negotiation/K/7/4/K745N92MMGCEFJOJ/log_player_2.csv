"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. Alice's offer is $120, which is below my maximum value
3. John's fixed price is $150
4. There are 10 rounds of negotiation possible
5. Alice's initial tone seems open to negotiation

Given that Alice's offer of $120 is already $30 less than John's price and my maximum value, it's a reasonable offer. However, since Alice seems open to negotiation and we have multiple rounds available, I believe there might be room to negotiate for an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that acknowledges Alice's initial offer while trying to get a better deal.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. Your product seems interesting, but I was hoping to spend a bit less. Would you consider $90 for the product? This would be a fair price that works within my budget."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still believe the product is worth more than $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's try $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice has come down from $120 to $105, showing willingness to negotiate
2. The new price is $45 less than John's price ($150)
3. Alice specifically met me halfway between her initial $120 and my $90 offer
4. $105 is a significant reduction from both my maximum value and John's price
5. While there might be room for further negotiation, the current offer is quite good

Given that Alice has made a substantial concession and offered a fair compromise, and considering that $105 represents a good value compared to both my maximum price and John's offer, I think it's reasonable to accept this offer.
