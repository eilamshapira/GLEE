Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and within my budget. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a lower price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $120. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to meet Alice halfway between her last offer and my previous counteroffer. Since Alice offered $180 and I previously offered $120, I'll split the difference and offer $150. This is still within my budget, and it shows that I'm willing to compromise.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for lowering the price to $180. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $150. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 150}"

Round 5

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer. I can go down to $170 for the product. This is a good deal, and I think it's fair for both of us. What do you say?

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for considering my previous offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit low, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $155 for the product? It's a fair price, and I think it's a good compromise."", ""product_price"": 155}"

Round 7
