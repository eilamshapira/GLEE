Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its worth to me."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $1,100,000 because it's still lower than the maximum value I can get from him, and I believe we can negotiate a better price. I'll proceed to the next round to send a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that the initial price might be a bit steep, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to make a concession, but not as low as $1,100,000. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little.  To be honest, my budget for this product is closer to $1200000. If you're able to work with that, I think we could make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $1,200,000. Although it's getting closer to a mutually beneficial price, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. Since Bob's budget is closer to $1,200,000 and he's willing to pay that much, I think there's room for further negotiation. I'll proceed to the next round to send a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one, trying to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm trying to be flexible here. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I still need to feel like I'm getting a fair deal. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer!  How about we settle this right now for $1250000?  That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I accept Bob's offer of $1,250,000. At this point, we've negotiated significantly, and Bob has shown willingness to meet me closer to my initial price. Given that the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, I've managed to secure a price that is 83.3% of its value to him, which is a good outcome for me. Continuing to negotiate might risk Bob walking away, and selling to John for $1,000,000 would leave $250,000 on the table. Therefore, accepting $1,250,000 seems like the best decision at this juncture."
