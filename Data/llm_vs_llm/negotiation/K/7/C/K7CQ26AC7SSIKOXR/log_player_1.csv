Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time. This is my best and final offer, but I'm open to discussing it further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will reject Bob's offer of $1,000,000 and make a counteroffer. Since Bob mentioned that $1,200,000 is outside his budget but he's still interested in the product, I'll try to find a middle ground.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make a compromise.
