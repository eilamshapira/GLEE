"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1400000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to me and Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000 is lower than my maximum budget, I'll try to negotiate further to save as much money as possible.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since Alice's offer was $1,400,000, I'll offer $1,200,000, which is close to the value the product is worth to Alice.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposal. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1350000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has made a counteroffer of $1,350,000, which is still higher than my desired price of $1,200,000, but lower than her initial offer. Since she mentioned it's her final offer, I'll have to weigh my options carefully.

Considering the product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and Alice's final offer is $1,350,000, I'm still saving $150,000 compared to buying from John. However, I'm not sure if I can get a better deal from Alice or if she's truly unwilling to go lower.

Given the circumstances, I think I'll accept Alice's final offer, as it's still a good deal for me and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to purchase the product.
