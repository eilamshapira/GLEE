"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $200.  I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $200
2. The product is only worth $120 to me
3. John is willing to sell it for $120
4. Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price

Since $200 is well above my maximum value ($120), and even above John's price ($120), there's no reason to accept this offer. While I could make a counteroffer, it's worth noting that Alice values the product at $150, so she might not be willing to go as low as $120. 

Given that John's price ($120) matches my maximum value and is significantly lower than Alice's current offer, the most rational decision would be to buy from John.
