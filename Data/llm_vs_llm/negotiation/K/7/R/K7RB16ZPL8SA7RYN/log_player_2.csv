"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer is $12,000, which is the same price as John's offer, and knowing that the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. Alice has room to negotiate down since her cost is $10,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice and $12,000 is my maximum value, I'll start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation. I'll offer $10,500, which would still give Alice a $500 profit while saving me $1,500 compared to buying from John.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has lowered her price from $12,000 to $11,500, showing willingness to negotiate. However, since she rejected my $10,500 offer and countered with $11,500, I'll continue negotiating as there's still room for a better price. $11,500 is better than John's price of $12,000, but I believe we can reach a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer to $11,000, which is halfway between my last offer ($10,500) and Alice's current offer ($11,500). This would still give Alice a $1,000 profit while saving me $1,000 compared to John's price.
