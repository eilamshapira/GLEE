"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $13,000 is significantly above my maximum value of $10,000, and it's also higher than John's alternative offer of $10,000. It would be better to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations with Alice don't improve, I can always buy from John at $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is below my maximum value of $10,000 and gives room for negotiation. If Alice rejects this, we can potentially meet somewhere in the middle, as long as it doesn't exceed my maximum value. If negotiations don't work out, I still have the option to buy from John at $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still well above both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's alternative offer ($10,000). While Alice has reduced the price from her initial offer, it's still not acceptable. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. If Alice continues to make offers above $10,000, I can always exercise my option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9500}

I'll increase my offer to $9,500. This shows some movement from my previous offer of $9,000 and demonstrates willingness to negotiate, while still staying below my maximum value of $10,000. If Alice doesn't accept this, I still have the option to go with John's $10,000 offer. Given that the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, she might consider this offer as it would still give her a $2,500 profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price that would be acceptable for me (below $10,000). Her latest offer of $12,200 is still well above my maximum value, and while she has been lowering her price, the decrements are too small to reach an acceptable price within the remaining rounds. Given that John's offer of $10,000 exactly matches my maximum value, and to avoid wasting more time in negotiations that are unlikely to succeed, I'll take John's offer now."
