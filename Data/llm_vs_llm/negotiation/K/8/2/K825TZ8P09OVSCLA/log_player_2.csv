Let's start with a low offer and see how Alice responds. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $15,000 limit."

While closer, $14,000 is still a bit high. Let's try to negotiate a bit more."

This offer is a significant jump from our previous offer, showing Alice we're willing to move closer to her price range. However, it still leaves us some room for negotiation before reaching our $15,000 limit."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is coming down in price, and $13,500 is a reasonable deal, saving us $1,500 compared to John's offer. It's unlikely we'll get a much better price from Alice."
