"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $7500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for.

"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. $12000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $8500. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. Let me know if this works for you.",8500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your highest offer of $8500. I understand that you're stretching your budget, and I respect that. However, I still need to get a better price for the product. I'll make a small concession, but I hope you can consider meeting me closer to my target price.
