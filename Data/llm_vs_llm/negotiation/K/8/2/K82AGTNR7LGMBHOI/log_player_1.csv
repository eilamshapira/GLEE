"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $5000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $5,000 because it's significantly lower than my initial offer and below the minimum value I have for the product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a more reasonable offer. I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but $5,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and find a middle ground. I'll lower my price, but I still need to ensure I get a fair value for the product."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $15000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer $7500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $7,500. Although he's increasing his offer, it's still below the minimum value I'm willing to accept. Since I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, I'll continue to negotiate with Bob to see if he can meet or exceed that price. I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $7,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. $12000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $8500. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $8,500. Although he's increasing his offer again, it's still below the price I'm willing to accept, and I have a better alternative with John's offer of $10,000. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, but I need to see a more significant increase in his offer to consider it. I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer, trying to bridge the gap between my target price and Bob's offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your highest offer of $8,500. I understand that you're stretching your budget, and I respect that.

I'm willing to sell the product for $10,500, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
