"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I need to point out that the product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I can actually purchase it from another seller, John, for exactly $1000000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I can't justify paying more than the product's value to me. I'm willing to offer you $900000 for the product, which would save me some money while still providing you with a quick sale. Let me know if this works for you.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your perspective. However, I believe we can find a middle ground that benefits both of us. I'm willing to lower my offer to $1100000. This way, you'll still save some money compared to the product's value to you, and I'll also get a fair deal. Looking forward to your response.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but I still can't justify paying $1100000 when the product is only worth $1000000 to me at most. Additionally, I can purchase the same product from John for exactly $1000000. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I need a better price. I'm willing to offer you $950000. This gives you a quick sale and me a small savings compared to my alternative option. How does that sound?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your patience. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to make another concession. Let's settle for $1050000. This price is very close to the product's value to you and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. I believe this is a fair compromise for both parties. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation and the reduced offer. However, I still need to be practical about this purchase. The product is worth a maximum of $1000000 to me, and I have a guaranteed option to purchase it from John at exactly $1000000. For me to choose you as my seller, I would need a price below that alternative. My offer is $975000. This gives you a quick sale that's very close to the product's value, while giving me a small incentive to choose you over my alternative option. Can we agree on this price?",975000.0,Bob,6,
