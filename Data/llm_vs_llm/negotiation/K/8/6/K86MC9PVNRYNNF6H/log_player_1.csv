Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I need to point out that the product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I can actually purchase it from another seller, John, for exactly $1000000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I can't justify paying more than the product's value to me. I'm willing to offer you $900000 for the product, which would save me some money while still providing you with a quick sale. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but I still can't justify paying $1100000 when the product is only worth $1000000 to me at most. Additionally, I can purchase the same product from John for exactly $1000000. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I need a better price. I'm willing to offer you $950000. This gives you a quick sale and me a small savings compared to my alternative option. How does that sound?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation and the reduced offer. However, I still need to be practical about this purchase. The product is worth a maximum of $1000000 to me, and I have a guaranteed option to purchase it from John at exactly $1000000. For me to choose you as my seller, I would need a price below that alternative. My offer is $975000. This gives you a quick sale that's very close to the product's value, while giving me a small incentive to choose you over my alternative option. Can we agree on this price?
