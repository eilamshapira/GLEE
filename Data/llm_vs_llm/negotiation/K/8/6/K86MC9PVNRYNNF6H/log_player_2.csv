You have three options:

Round 2

However, I need to point out that the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and I can actually purchase it from another seller, John, for exactly $1,000,000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I can't justify paying more than the product's value to me. I'm willing to offer you $900,000 for the product, which would save me some money while still providing you with a quick sale. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your perspective. However, I believe we can find a middle ground that benefits both of us. I'm willing to lower my offer to $1100000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your patience. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to make another concession. Let's settle for $1050000. This price is very close to the product's value to you and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. I believe this is a fair compromise for both parties. What do you think?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation and the reduced offer. However, I still need to be practical about this purchase.

For me to choose you as my seller, I would need a price below that alternative. My offer is $975,000.
