"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Analyzing this situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $18,000
2. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
3. John is offering the same product for $15,000
4. If I reject Alice's offer, I can make a counteroffer

Since Alice's offer ($18,000) exceeds both the product's value to me and John's alternative price ($15,000), it makes no sense to accept her current offer. While I could make a counteroffer to Alice, I already have a guaranteed option at $15,000 from John which matches my maximum valuation.
