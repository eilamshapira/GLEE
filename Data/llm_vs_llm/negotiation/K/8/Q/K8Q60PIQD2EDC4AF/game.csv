"Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique qualities and potential benefits, I'm initially pricing it at $1500000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $800000 is lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $1300000. This reflects the product's value and includes a concession on my part.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1300000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. This shows my commitment to a deal, but it's the highest I can go.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $950000. It shows you recognize the value. Let's try to find a number that works for both of us. I can come down to $1200000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see you're willing to negotiate, but $1200000 is still outside my budget. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm offering $1050000.  This represents a good compromise and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product.",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we are getting closer. I can meet you at $1150000. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",1150000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1150000 is still a bit too high.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1050000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
