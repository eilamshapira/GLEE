"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I have the option to sell to John for $120, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I will also not sell to John immediately, as I want to try to negotiate a better price with Bob.

My decision is to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I will make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

My counteroffer to Bob is: $140."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $125 is above my minimum acceptable price of $120 and closer to my desired price, I will consider accepting it. However, I will also think about trying to negotiate a slightly better price.

But given that Bob's offer is already higher than my minimum acceptable price and John's offer, and I don't know if Bob will be willing to pay more, I will choose to accept Bob's offer.
