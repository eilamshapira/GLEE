"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints.",600000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $600000 is significantly below my expectations. I am countering with $1400000, which I believe still offers you great value for the product. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value this product can bring is significant. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a very competitive offer, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1350000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to propose $750000. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your attempt to meet in the middle, but $750000 is still not feasible for me. I'm willing to lower my price to $1300000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is my best offer considering the value of the product. Please let me know if this works for you.",1300000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $1250000, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price. This is a final offer from my side, and I hope it aligns with your budget. Let me know if we can close the deal at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
