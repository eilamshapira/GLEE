"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is quite a bit lower than what I need for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get out of it.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $95 is closer, but I'm still on a bit of a budget. Could we maybe settle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $75 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference at $85? That seems like a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,5,
