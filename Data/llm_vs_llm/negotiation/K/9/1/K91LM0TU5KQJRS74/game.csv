"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high price.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $500000 for it. What do you say?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. Given the unique value of the product, I'm willing to lower my offer to $1500000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1500000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $750000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're still a bit apart on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer. How about $1250000? This is the lowest I can go while still valuing the product appropriately. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference between our last two offers? I'd be willing to go to $1000000 even.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
