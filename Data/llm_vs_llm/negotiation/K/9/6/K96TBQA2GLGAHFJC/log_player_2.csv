"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,200,000
2. John's fixed price is $1,200,000
3. Alice's current offer is $1,000,000

Alice's offer is $200,000 less than my maximum value and John's price. This is a good offer, but since this is just the first round, I might be able to negotiate an even better price. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get an even better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice offered $1,000,000, I'll try to negotiate significantly lower while still being reasonable. I'll offer $800,000, which is $200,000 less than her initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation while still being a substantial amount.

{""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","This is an excellent development:

1. Alice's initial offer was $1,000,000
2. I countered with $800,000
3. Now Alice has come down to $850,000, which is $350,000 less than my maximum value and John's price

Alice has shown significant flexibility by reducing her price by $150,000 from her initial offer. This is a very good price, and there's a risk that if I try to negotiate further, Alice might become less cooperative or raise the price. The current offer represents a substantial saving of $350,000 compared to John's price.

I should accept this offer as it's a very good deal.
