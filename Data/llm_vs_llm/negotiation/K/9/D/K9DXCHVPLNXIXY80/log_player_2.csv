"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Based on the information provided, I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of $120, reject it, or buy from John for $100.

Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and John is offering it for exactly $100, Alice's offer of $120 exceeds the maximum value I place on the product. It wouldn't make financial sense to pay $120 for something I value at $100 or less.

The best decision would be to purchase from John at $100, which matches the maximum value I place on the item.
