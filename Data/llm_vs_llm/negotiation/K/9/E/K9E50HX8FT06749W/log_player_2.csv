"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire the product that could greatly benefit you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is higher than her personal value of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than John's asking price of $1,500,000.  By accepting Alice's offer, you save $300,000 compared to buying from John."
