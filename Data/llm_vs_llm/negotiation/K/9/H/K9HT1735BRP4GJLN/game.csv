"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $11000 is a bit high for my budget. Given market conditions, I'd be willing to purchase it for $9000. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more affordable for me. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. However, considering the product's value, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $10000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
