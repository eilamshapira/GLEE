Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $11,000."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $11000 is a bit high for my budget. Given market conditions, I'd be willing to purchase it for $9000. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more affordable for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Okay, here's my decision:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:
