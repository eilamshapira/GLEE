"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $11000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $12,000
2. Alice's current offer is $11,000
3. I know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation
4. John's fixed price is $12,000 (highest price)

Since Alice's price ($11,000) is lower than John's price ($12,000), and I know there's significant room for negotiation (since Alice's cost is $8,000), it makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. There's no reason to accept $11,000 or buy from John at $12,000 when we can potentially get a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but gives me room to negotiate:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $11,000 is a bit high for my budget. Given market conditions, I'd be willing to purchase it for $9,000. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more affordable for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

This counteroffer is strategic because:
1. It's significantly above Alice's cost ($8,000), so she can still make a profit
2. It's well below my maximum value ($12,000), giving me room to negotiate up if needed
3. It's a substantial reduction from her initial offer ($11,000) but not so low as to be offensive
4. I've maintained a professional and friendly tone while justifying my lower offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. However, considering the product's value, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $10000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

1. Alice has moved down from $11,000 to $10,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. $10,000 is better than John's price of $12,000
3. There's still a $2,000 margin between Alice's cost ($8,000) and her current offer
4. We've already had some back-and-forth, and she's shown flexibility

While we might be able to negotiate further, $10,000 is a reasonable price:
- It's $2,000 below my maximum value
- It represents a fair middle ground between her initial offer and my counteroffer
- It gives Alice a reasonable profit while giving me a good deal
- There's risk in pushing too hard and potentially damaging the negotiation

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer.
