"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,500,000 is higher than what I'm willing to pay ($1,000,000) and also higher than John's price ($1,000,000). It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price from Alice. If negotiations don't work out, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

I'm offering $800,000, which is significantly below John's price of $1,000,000. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to John's offer. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate upward, and I always have John's $1,000,000 offer as a backup."
