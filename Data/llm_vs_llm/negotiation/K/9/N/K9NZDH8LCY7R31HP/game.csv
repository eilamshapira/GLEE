"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I must say that $500000 is a bit lower than I was expecting. Considering the product's exceptional value and the fact that I have other interested buyers, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you the product for $2200000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price.",2200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, I must say that $700000 is still below my expectations.

I can offer you the product for $2000000, which is a further reduction from my previous price.

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price as high as $2000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. I can offer $750000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market conditions and the product's value.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, I must say that $750000 is still below my expectations. I'm starting to think that we may not be able to meet in the middle, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you the product for $1800000, which is a significant reduction from my previous prices. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1800000.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price as high as $1800000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. I can offer $775000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market conditions and the product's value. If we can't agree on a price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from another seller.",775000.0,Bob,8,
