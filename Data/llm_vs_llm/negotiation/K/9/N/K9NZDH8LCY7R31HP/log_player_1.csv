Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $2,500,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a better option than accepting Bob's offer, but I want to try to negotiate a better price with Bob first."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I must say that $500,000 is a bit lower than I was expecting. Considering the product's exceptional value and the fact that I have other interested buyers, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you the product for $2,200,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price."", ""product_price"": 2200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair offer considering the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $700,000 is still significantly lower than the product's value to me. While he has increased his offer, it's not enough to meet my expectations. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a better option than accepting Bob's offer, but I want to try to negotiate a better price with Bob first."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, I must say that $700,000 is still below my expectations. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to ensure that I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you the product for $2,000,000, which is a further reduction from my previous price. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price as high as $2000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. I can offer $750000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market conditions and the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $750,000 is still significantly lower than the product's value to me. While he has increased his offer again, it's not enough to meet my expectations. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer. However, I'm starting to think that Bob may not be willing to meet me at a price that I'm comfortable with, so I'll need to consider selling to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiations don't improve soon."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, I must say that $750,000 is still below my expectations. I'm starting to think that we may not be able to meet in the middle, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you the product for $1,800,000, which is a significant reduction from my previous prices. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value and the market conditions."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price as high as $1800000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. I can offer $775000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market conditions and the product's value. If we can't agree on a price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

At this point, it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet me at a price that I'm comfortable with. His offer of $775,000 is still significantly lower than the product's value to me, and I don't think he's going to increase his offer substantially. Given that I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which is a much better price than Bob's offer, I think it's time to end the negotiations with Bob and sell the product to John. This ensures that I get a fair price for the product and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob not leading to a satisfactory outcome."
