Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to me and only $1,000,000 to Bob, I'll start with a high offer since I always have John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 as a backup.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000 (and even below Bob's own valuation of $1,000,000), and since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $1,500,000, the rational choice is to sell to John.
