Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price to offer Bob.

Given that:
- The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob
- My minimum acceptable price is $800,000
- I have a guaranteed backup offer of $800,000 from John

I want to maximize my profit while ensuring Bob is likely to accept. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, he would still profit from any price below that. However, if I price too close to $1,500,000, he might reject it. A reasonable strategy would be to split the difference between my minimum price ($800,000) and Bob's maximum value ($1,500,000), leaning towards the higher end since I have the backup offer.

{""product_price"": 1200000}

This offer gives Bob a potential profit of $300,000 while giving me a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price."
