"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $120 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $80, and also higher than John's price of $80. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $70. This is below my maximum value of $80 and gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's price. Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, this offer might be too low for her to accept, but it's a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer as it's still above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). Since Alice has lowered her price significantly from $120 to $100, it suggests she's willing to negotiate further. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 75}

I'll increase my offer to $75. This is still below my maximum value of $80 and John's price, but moves closer to Alice's last offer of $100. Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, she might still reject this, but it shows I'm willing to move up from my previous offer while still trying to get a better deal than John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Alice's offers are still consistently above $80 (my maximum value and John's price), and even though she's gradually lowering her price, she's still well above John's offer of $80. Given that we've gone through several rounds of negotiation and Alice hasn't come down to a price that would be better than John's, it makes the most sense to take the guaranteed $80 price from John rather than continue negotiating."
