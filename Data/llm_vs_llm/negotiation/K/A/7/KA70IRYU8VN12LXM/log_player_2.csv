"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. How about I offer it to you for $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider Alice's offer of $140 compared to John's price of $150.

The product is worth up to $150 to me, so both offers are acceptable. However, my goal is to save as much money as possible while still getting the product.

Alice's offer ($140) is $10 cheaper than John's price ($150), so accepting Alice's offer would be the financially better choice.
