"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this price reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $1200000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'd like to counteroffer with a price of $1650000, which I believe is more in line with the product's value.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1650000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a price of $1400000, which I believe is a reasonable midpoint between our previous offers.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. While $1400000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'd like to counteroffer with a price of $1575000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise between our previous offers.",1575000.0,Alice,5,
