Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is lower than the minimum value of $1,200,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,200,000, I will reject Bob's offer. However, before selling to John, I want to try to negotiate a better price with Bob. So, I will proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

My counteroffer is: $1,800,000

But in the format you requested, my decision for this round is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still lower than the minimum value of $1,200,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,200,000, I will reject Bob's offer. At this point, it seems that Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price, and I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 with John.

My decision is: {""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
