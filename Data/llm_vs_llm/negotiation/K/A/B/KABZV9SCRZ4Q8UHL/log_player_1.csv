"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product and I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start by making a high offer. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially settle on a higher price than if I started with a lower offer.

{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is higher than the minimum value I have for the product ($800,000), it's a good starting point for negotiations. However, I believe the product might be worth more to Bob, so I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob was willing to pay $1,000,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my initial offer, but still lower than what I think might be the maximum he's willing to pay. This will give me room to negotiate further and potentially get a better price.

{""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's new offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to what I consider a good price for the product. Since it's still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'll reject his offer again and try to get an even better price. However, I'll also keep in mind that I don't want to risk losing the deal, so I'll make sure my next counteroffer is reasonable.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob was willing to pay $1,050,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than his previous offer, but still reasonable. I'll aim for a price that's closer to what I initially offered, but take into account the progress we've made in the negotiations so far.
