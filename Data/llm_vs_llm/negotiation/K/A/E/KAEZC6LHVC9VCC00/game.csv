"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price point that is more aligned with my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $650000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must say that $650000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $920000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations.",920000.0,Alice,3,
