"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
2. John is offering it for $15,000 (my worst-case option)
3. Alice is offering it for $12,000, which is:
   - $3,000 less than John's price
   - Below my maximum value of $15,000
   - Seems like a reasonable starting offer

While I might be able to negotiate an even better price by making a counteroffer, $12,000 is already a good price that saves me $3,000 compared to John's offer. Since there's no guarantee that further negotiation would yield a better result (and might risk losing this good offer), I'll accept Alice's offer.
