"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since both Alice's offer and John's price are $15,000, there's no advantage in accepting Alice's current offer or buying from John. It makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, as there's a possibility to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be unreasonable. I'll start at around 60% of the asking price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced the price by $2,000 from her initial offer, which shows she's willing to negotiate. $13,000 is better than John's price of $15,000, but there might still be room for further negotiation. Since we know the product is worth no more than $15,000 to us, and we have John's offer as a backup, it's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if we can get an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $15,000 to $13,000, and my previous offer of $9,000 was rejected, I'll try to meet somewhere in the middle of our last positions. I'll offer $11,000, which is a reasonable increase from my last offer but still gives us a good savings compared to John's price.
