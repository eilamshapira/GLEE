"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my initial offer. How about $1250000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1000000? That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  while I understand your position, $1000000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $1150000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. Let's close this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
