Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my initial offer. How about $1250000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  while I understand your position, $1000000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $1150000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $1,150,000.  I can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so it makes more sense to take that deal."
