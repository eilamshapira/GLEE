"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $200 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $120, and also higher than John's price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know I can get the product for $120 from John, and the product is worth no more than $120 to me, I'll start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 80}

This offer is deliberately below my maximum value to allow for potential back-and-forth negotiation while still giving me the opportunity to save money compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $180 is still significantly higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120). I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating with a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has moved down from $200 to $180, I'll increase my previous offer slightly but still stay well below my maximum value.

{""product_price"": 90}

I'm offering $90 now, which is a small increase from my previous offer of $80. This shows some willingness to negotiate while still keeping plenty of room below both my maximum value and John's price of $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $170 is still well above both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120). While Alice is gradually lowering the price, it's still not competitive with my alternative option. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has shown willingness to reduce her price (from $200 to $180 to $170), I'll increase my offer again but still maintain a good margin below John's price.

{""product_price"": 100}

I'm now offering $100, which is a $10 increase from my last offer. This shows continued willingness to negotiate while still staying well below both my maximum value and John's price of $120. If Alice doesn't accept offers close to this range soon, it might be better to take John's offer rather than continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I think it's best to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's current offer ($160) is still well above John's price ($120)
2. We've had several rounds of negotiation, and Alice's price reductions are small
3. Even though we have more rounds available, Alice's pattern suggests she's unlikely to drop below $120
4. Since $120 is also my maximum value for the product, there's no point in continuing negotiations

Therefore, I'll take the guaranteed option of buying from John for $120."
