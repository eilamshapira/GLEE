"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2500000 is beyond my budget. Iâ€™m willing to offer $500000 for the product. Let me know if we can reach an agreement.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $500000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand my initial price might have been high, so I'm willing to reduce it to $1800000, which is a considerable reduction and reflects the true value of the product. This price point ensures you're getting excellent value while allowing me to maintain a fair return.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and negotiation. However, I need to be transparent - I have another buyer offering $1000000 for this product. I'm still interested in working with you, but I cannot go below that price point. Given this context, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1400000, which is significantly lower than my previous offers and still represents good value given the product's worth.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
