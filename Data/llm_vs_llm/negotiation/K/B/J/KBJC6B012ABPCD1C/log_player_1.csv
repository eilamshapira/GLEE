"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it for $2,500,000. This is a competitive price for such a premium product."", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2500000 is beyond my budget. Iâ€™m willing to offer $500000 for the product. Let me know if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll continue negotiating as $500,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round that's more attractive than my initial offer but still maintains good value for me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $500,000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand my initial price might have been high, so I'm willing to reduce it to $1,800,000, which is a considerable reduction and reflects the true value of the product. This price point ensures you're getting excellent value while allowing me to maintain a fair return."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting the price. However, I have to stay within my constraints. I can offer $600000 for the product. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll continue negotiating as Bob's offer is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. His small increase from $500,000 to $600,000 suggests he might have more room to negotiate, but if the next rounds don't show significant improvement, I'll consider taking John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and negotiation. However, I need to be transparent - I have another buyer offering $1,000,000 for this product. I'm still interested in working with you, but I cannot go below that price point. Given this context, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000, which is significantly lower than my previous offers and still represents good value given the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
