"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too high for me right now. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $170?",170.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. While I appreciate you coming down, I'm still trying to stick to my budget. How about $120? That's the highest I can realistically go right now.",120.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $120 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  I could let it go for $155, but that's my absolute final offer.",155.0,Alice,5,
