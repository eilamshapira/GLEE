"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'll analyze the options here:

1) Accept Alice's offer of $10,000
2) Reject Alice's offer
3) Buy from John for $12,000

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and Alice's offer ($10,000) is lower than John's price ($12,000), I should accept Alice's offer. This saves me $2,000 compared to buying from John.
