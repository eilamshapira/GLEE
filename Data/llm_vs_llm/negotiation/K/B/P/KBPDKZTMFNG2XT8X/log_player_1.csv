Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $12,000 to Bob
2. My minimum acceptable price is $8,000
3. If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed $8,000 from John
4. Bob will likely reject if the price is too close to $12,000
5. I should offer a price that gives Bob some surplus but maximizes my profit

I'll offer a price of $10,500. This:
- Gives Bob $1,500 in surplus ($12,000 - $10,500)
- Gives me $2,500 more than my fallback option with John
- Is below Bob's maximum value, making it attractive to accept
- Maximizes my profit while still being reasonable
