"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $150 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can actually get the same product from another seller for $80. I'd be willing to buy from you instead for $65 to save us both the hassle of me going elsewhere. Let me know if that works for you.",65.0,Bob,2,
