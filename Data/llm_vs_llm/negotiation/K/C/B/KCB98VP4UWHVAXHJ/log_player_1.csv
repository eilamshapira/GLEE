"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $150 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can actually get the same product from another seller for $80. I'd be willing to buy from you instead for $65 to save us both the hassle of me going elsewhere. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
