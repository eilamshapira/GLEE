"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a great product that I believe will be valuable for you. I am offering it to you at a price of $150. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","$150 is significantly higher than the $80 worth the product has to me, and it's also higher than John's price of $80. Since I can get the product from John for $80, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $150.

I should either reject and make a counteroffer to Alice, or buy from John immediately. Since John's price matches exactly what the product is worth to me, I'll first try to get a better deal from Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $150 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can actually get the same product from another seller for $80. I'd be willing to buy from you instead for $65 to save us both the hassle of me going elsewhere. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 65}"
