"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $10000 is too low for this product's value. While I understand you're looking for a better price, I need to ensure a fair deal. I can come down to $16000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price better reflects the product's true value and quality.",16000.0,Alice,3,
