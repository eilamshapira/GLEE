Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice! However, I was hoping to purchase the product for a lower price. How about $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and I can do better than that."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $10,000 is too low for this product's value. While I understand you're looking for a better price, I need to ensure a fair deal. I can come down to $16,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price better reflects the product's true value and quality."", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'll take John's offer of $12,000. Bob's offers have remained below my minimum acceptable price, and there's no guarantee that further negotiations will result in a better price than John's guaranteed $12,000."
