"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find the price to be quite high. I'm willing to discuss further and would like to offer $4000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",4000.0,Bob,2,,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your response. However, $4000 is much lower than acceptable. How about we adjust the terms to $30000? Let me know what you think.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer,30000.0
"Hi Bob, thanks for engaging in this process. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $4000 is far too low for this product. I'm willing to negotiate, and I propose $30000 as a fair price. Let me know if we can work from here.",30000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $30000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to counter with $5000. I hope we can find some middle ground.",5000.0,Bob,4,,
Bob's offer is still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll sell the product to John for $15000.,,Alice,4,SellToJhon,
