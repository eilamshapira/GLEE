Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer Bob for the product. Since the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at exactly $15,000, I should offer Bob a price that's higher than $15,000.

I don't know how much Bob values the product, so I'll need to balance between setting a price high enough to maximize my profit while not being so high that Bob automatically rejects it. A reasonable approach would be to set a moderately higher price than my guaranteed alternative.
