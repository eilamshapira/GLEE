"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $60 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is too low considering the product's value. I can't go below $110 as I have other potential buyers willing to pay more. However, I'm open to negotiating with you as I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $60 was a bit low, but $110 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, how about $75? I think this price reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for my budget.",75.0,Bob,4,
