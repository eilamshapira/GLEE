"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $120. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $60 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. Even though he's offering $60, I know the product is worth $100 to me and I still have a reliable alternative with John's offer at $100. I can try to negotiate with Bob for a better price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is too low considering the product's value. I can't go below $110 as I have other potential buyers willing to pay more. However, I'm open to negotiating with you as I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $60 was a bit low, but $110 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, how about $75? I think this price reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm choosing to sell to John because:
1. Bob's offer of $75 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100
2. Bob's last two offers ($60 and $75) suggest he's unlikely to reach my minimum price of $100
3. The product is only worth $80 to Bob, so he won't likely offer more than that
4. John's guaranteed offer of $100 meets my minimum price requirement
5. We've already gone through 4 rounds, and continuing the negotiation with Bob probably won't lead to a better outcome than John's offer"
