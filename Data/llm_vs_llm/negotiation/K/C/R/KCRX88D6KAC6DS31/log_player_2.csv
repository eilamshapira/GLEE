"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer for $14,999
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John for $10,000

Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and John is offering it for exactly $10,000, Alice's offer of $14,999 is significantly higher and not a good deal for me. I would be overpaying by nearly $5,000.
