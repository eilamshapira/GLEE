"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $160. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer compared to my alternatives.

Alice is offering the product for $160, but the product is only worth up to $120 to me. John (not Jhon) is willing to sell me the same product for $120, which matches the maximum I value it at.

Since I can get the product for $120 from John, and this saves me $40 compared to Alice's offer, the rational decision is to reject Alice's offer and buy from John instead.
