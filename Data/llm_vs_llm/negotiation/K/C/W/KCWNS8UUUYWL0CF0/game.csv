"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $11000. This represents a fair price considering the product's worth and potential value to you.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I was hoping for a better deal. How about I buy the product for $9000? This way, both of us can walk away feeling good about the transaction.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. The product's quality and value merit a higher price. I can come down to $10500, which still represents good value for you while allowing me a fair return. This is considerably below my initial offer and reflects my willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I need to manage my budget effectively. Let's meet in the middle at $9500. This price acknowledges the product's value while allowing me to stay within my financial constraints.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your effort to meet me in the middle. After careful consideration, I can offer you the product for $10000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and is the lowest I can go while still ensuring a reasonable return. At this price, we both benefit - you receive a product worth $12000 to you at a $2000 discount, and I receive a fair value above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is truly a win-win solution.",10000.0,Alice,5,
