Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. The product's quality and value merit a higher price. I can come down to $10500, which still represents good value for you while allowing me a fair return. This is considerably below my initial offer and reflects my willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your effort to meet me in the middle. After careful consideration, I can offer you the product for $10000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and is the lowest I can go while still ensuring a reasonable return. At this price, we both benefit - you receive a product worth $12000 to you at a $2000 discount, and I receive a fair value above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is truly a win-win solution.
