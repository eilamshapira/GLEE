Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that the product is worth $1,500,000 to me and only $1,000,000 to Bob, I should start with a high offer but leave some room for negotiation, while keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and even below his own valuation ($1,000,000). Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, which matches my minimum acceptable price, it makes the most sense to end the negotiation with Bob and sell to John.
