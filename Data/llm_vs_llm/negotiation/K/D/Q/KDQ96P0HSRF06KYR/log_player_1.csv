Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 25000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Considering my options: I *could* sell to Bob for $8,000, but that's less than I could get from John. I *could* also go for a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to get more than $10,000.

I choose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counter_offer"": 15000}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
