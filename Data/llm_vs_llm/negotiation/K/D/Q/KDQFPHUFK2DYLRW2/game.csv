"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $900000 shows we're moving in the right direction, it's still below what I believe is fair value for this product. Given its quality and market position, I can offer it at $1050000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. This represents excellent value for what you'll be getting.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
