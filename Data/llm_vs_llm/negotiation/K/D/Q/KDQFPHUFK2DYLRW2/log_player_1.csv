"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential value. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. The product sounds interesting, but $1200000 is a little more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $900000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer as $900,000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. There's still room for negotiation to achieve a better price, and I have several rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $900,000 shows we're moving in the right direction, it's still below what I believe is fair value for this product. Given its quality and market position, I can offer it at $1,050,000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. This represents excellent value for what you'll be getting."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand the value you see in the product. How about we meet in the middle at $975000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $975,000. This is a good price that's significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and Bob seems to have moved up considerably from his initial offer. While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk that prolonged negotiations might lead Bob to walk away, leaving me with only John's $800,000 offer. $975,000 represents a good compromise and a profitable deal."
