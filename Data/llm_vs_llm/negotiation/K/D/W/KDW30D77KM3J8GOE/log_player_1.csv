Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make a strategic offer to Bob. Since I know I can get $8,000 from John, I'll offer a higher price to Bob to maximize my potential profit. I'll set the price relatively high but not unreasonably so, as I want to give Bob a chance to accept while ensuring a good profit margin.
