,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're working within a budget, but I believe the product's value is higher than $500000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to propose a price of $900000, which I think is more reflective of the product's worth.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is still a bit high for my budget. I could go up to $650000.  This represents a significant investment on my part and I believe it's a fair price.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your revised offer and understand that you're making a significant investment. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than $650000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $850000, which I think is a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,5,
