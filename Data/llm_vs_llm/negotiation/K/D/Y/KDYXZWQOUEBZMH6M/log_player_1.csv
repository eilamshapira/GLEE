Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the potential value, I'm working within a specific budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $500000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $500,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. My counteroffer is $900,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is still a bit high for my budget. I could go up to $650000.  This represents a significant investment on my part and I believe it's a fair price.

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as $650,000 is still below my desired price. My counteroffer is $850,000.

Bob's offer:

Since Bob's final offer of $750,000 is lower than John's offer of $800,000, I think it's best to sell the product to John for $800,000. This ensures I get a higher price for the product."
