"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget. Would you consider $6000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I understand budget constraints, $6000 is too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $16500? This is closer to the product's market value and offers you a great deal.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $16500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to consider $8000?  That's the absolute highest I can go.",8000.0,Bob,4,
