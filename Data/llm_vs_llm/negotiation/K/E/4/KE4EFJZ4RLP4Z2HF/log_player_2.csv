"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you this product for $12000. This is a limited opportunity and I must mention that if you decide not to take it, I have another buyer ready to purchase at the same price. Please let me know if you’d like to proceed! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to consider my options carefully:

- Alice is offering the product for $12,000
- The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $12,000

Since the price is the same ($12,000) whether I buy from Alice or John, and the product is worth exactly $12,000 to me, I'm indifferent between options 1 and 3. I won't get any better deal by rejecting Alice's offer.
