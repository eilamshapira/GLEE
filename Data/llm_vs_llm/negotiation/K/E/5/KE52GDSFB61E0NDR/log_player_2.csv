"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $80 to me
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $100
3. John is willing to sell it for $80

Since Alice's offer ($100) is higher than both:
- The value I place on the product ($80)
- John's alternative offer ($80)

The rational choice would be to buy from John. There's no reason to pay more for the same product when I can get it at a price that matches my maximum valuation.
