"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800000 is at the upper limit of my budget. Given that I can purchase the same product from John for that price, I'd like to propose $700000 instead. This would give me some room in my budget and provide you with a guaranteed sale today. Would that work for you?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I understand your concerns. However, given the product’s true value and the fact that John is ready to purchase it for $800000, my best offer for you is also $800000. This is the firm price reflecting the premium quality of the product. Please let me know if you would like to proceed at this price.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your position on the product's value. However, purchasing from you rather than John should come with some advantage for me. I'm prepared to offer $750000 which gives you an immediate sale without any further negotiation delays. This is a very fair offer considering I can go to John right now at your asking price. What do you say?",750000.0,Bob,4,
