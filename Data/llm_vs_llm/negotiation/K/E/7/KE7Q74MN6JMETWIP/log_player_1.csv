Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800000 is at the upper limit of my budget. Given that I can purchase the same product from John for that price, I'd like to propose $700000 instead. This would give me some room in my budget and provide you with a guaranteed sale today. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your position on the product's value. However, purchasing from you rather than John should come with some advantage for me. I'm prepared to offer $750000 which gives you an immediate sale without any further negotiation delays. This is a very fair offer considering I can go to John right now at your asking price. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
