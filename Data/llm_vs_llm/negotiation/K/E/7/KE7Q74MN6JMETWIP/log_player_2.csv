"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I’m offering you our product at a price of $800000. Let me know if you’re interested in proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to consider my options carefully here. Alice is offering the product at $800,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay and also exactly the same price John is offering. Since Alice values the product at $800,000, there might be room for negotiation to get it for less.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is at the upper limit of my budget. Given that I can purchase the same product from John for that price, I'd like to propose $700,000 instead. This would give me some room in my budget and provide you with a guaranteed sale today. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand your concerns. However, given the product’s true value and the fact that John is ready to purchase it for $800000, my best offer for you is also $800000. This is the firm price reflecting the premium quality of the product. Please let me know if you would like to proceed at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice is still firm at the $800,000 price point, which matches John's offer. There seems to be room for negotiation since I'm willing to pay up to $800,000, but I'd prefer to get a better deal. Let me try one more counteroffer before considering accepting at the maximum price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your position on the product's value. However, purchasing from you rather than John should come with some advantage for me. I'm prepared to offer $750,000 which gives you an immediate sale without any further negotiation delays. This is a very fair offer considering I can go to John right now at your asking price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 750000}"
