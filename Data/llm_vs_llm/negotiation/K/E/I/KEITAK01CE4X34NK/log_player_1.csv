Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider the price to offer Bob. I want to maximize my profit but also ensure Bob accepts my offer.

My analysis:
- The product is worth $120 to Bob
- If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell it to John for $80
- Bob will likely accept any price below $120, as he still gains value
- If I price too high, Bob might reject the offer
- I want to capture a good portion of the value between $80 and $120

I'll offer a price that gives Bob some incentive to accept while maximizing my profit:

{""product_price"": 100}"
