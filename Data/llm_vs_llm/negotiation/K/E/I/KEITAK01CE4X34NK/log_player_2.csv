"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $100
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John at $120

The product is worth up to $120 for me (Bob), and I want to save as much money as possible. 
Alice's offer of $100 is $20 less than John's price ($120).
Since my goal is to buy the product while saving money, and Alice's offer is the lowest available price, I should accept her offer.
