"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product sounds interesting, but $15000 is a bit too steep for me. How about $6000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $6000 is below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12000?",12000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but the value this product brings is significant. Let's settle at $11000, which is a fair price considering the quality and utility of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks Alice. While I appreciate the offer, it's still a bit high for me. My absolute max is $8000, considering I can get it elsewhere for that price.  Would you consider selling it to me for $7500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, $7500 is still below what we can accept. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $10500? This is very close to the minimum we can go, and it reflects the high value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a fair price. Given your budget and the value of the product, I'm willing to lower my offer further to $10250. This is really the lowest I can go while still maintaining the integrity of the product's worth.",10250.0,Alice,5,
