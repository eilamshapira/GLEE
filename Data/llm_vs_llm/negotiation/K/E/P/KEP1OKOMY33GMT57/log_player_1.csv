Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150, I will reject his offer.

Also, since selling to John for $150 is a better option than selling to Bob for $100, I will not consider selling to John at this point, but rather try to negotiate a better price with Bob.

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

Selling to John for $150 is still a better option than selling to Bob for $120, but I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob.
