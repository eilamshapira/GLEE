"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $200 is higher than both my maximum value ($150) and John's price ($150). It would be irrational to accept this offer when I can either:
1. Try to negotiate a better price with Alice through a counteroffer, or
2. Buy from John for $150

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, as there's potential to get an even better deal than John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 100}

I'll offer $100, which is significantly lower than both John's price ($150) and Alice's initial offer ($200). This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to get a better deal than John's price. If Alice rejects this offer, we can still negotiate further, or I always have the option to go with John's $150 offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll continue to reject Alice's offer because:
1. $180 is still above both my maximum value ($150) and John's price ($150)
2. Alice has shown willingness to reduce the price (from $200 to $180)
3. There's still room for negotiation to potentially get a better price than John's $150

I'll make another counteroffer in the next round. If we can't reach a better deal than John's $150, I can always fall back on that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 120}

I'll increase my offer to $120. This is a reasonable step up from my previous offer of $100, showing that I'm willing to negotiate in good faith. This price is still below John's price of $150, which gives me room to potentially save money while also leaving space for further negotiation if needed. If Alice rejects this offer, I can either continue negotiating or fall back on John's $150 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John because:
1. Alice's current offer ($170) is still above both my maximum value ($150) and John's price ($150)
2. Despite multiple rounds of negotiation, Alice hasn't come down to a price that's competitive with John's offer
3. Alice's price reductions (from $200 to $180 to $170) are moving slowly and suggest she might not be willing to go below $150
4. Continuing the negotiation further might not be productive since we seem far apart on price

Therefore, it's most rational to take John's guaranteed offer of $150, which matches my maximum value and is better than any offer Alice has made so far."
