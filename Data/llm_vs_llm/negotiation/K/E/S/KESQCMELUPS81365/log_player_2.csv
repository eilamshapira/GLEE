"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll really appreciate. I'm selling it for $150. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me think about this:
1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $150
3. John is willing to sell it for $100
4. If I accept Alice's offer, I'll be paying $50 more than what the product is worth to me
5. If I buy from John, I'll pay exactly what the product is worth to me

Since Alice's price ($150) is higher than both:
- The product's value to me ($100)
- John's alternative offer ($100)

The logical choice is to buy from John.
