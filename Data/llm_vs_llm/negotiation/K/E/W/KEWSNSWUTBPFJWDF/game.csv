"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is quite high for me. I know this product is available elsewhere for $100. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation. Would you consider selling it for $85? This would save me the trouble of going elsewhere, and you'd still make a sale.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While $85 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to meet you somewhere in the middle. How about $135?",135.0,Alice,3,
