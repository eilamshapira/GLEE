Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is quite high for me. I know this product is available elsewhere for $100. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation. Would you consider selling it for $85? This would save me the trouble of going elsewhere, and you'd still make a sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
