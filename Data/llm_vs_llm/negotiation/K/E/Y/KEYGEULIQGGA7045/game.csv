"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? ",102.5,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $102.50 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $95 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little more. How about we meet in the middle again at $100? It's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
