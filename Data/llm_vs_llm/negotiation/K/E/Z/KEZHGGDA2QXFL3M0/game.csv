"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget concerns, but $90 is below what I can accept as this is a quality product. I can come down to $135, which is a fair discount from my initial offer. How does that sound?",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I can meet you in the middle between my previous offer and your current offer. I'm willing to buy the product for $110.",110.0,Bob,4,
