"Alice, your price is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $12000.  Would you be willing to work with me on that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $12000 is below our minimum acceptable price. I can offer you the product for $16000, which is a fair compromise considering its value. Let me know if this works for you.",16000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go to $13000. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're able to accept it.",13000.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but $13000 is still below our minimum threshold. I can go as low as $15500, which is my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other buyers. Let me know your decision.",15500.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
