You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price. Since Bob is willing to pay $60 and the product is worth $80 to him, I'll try to meet him halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. 

My counteroffer: $100"

Since Bob's offer of $80 is very close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($80 is the value of the product to Bob, and it's also a price that I can live with), and considering that I've been negotiating with him for a while, I think it's a good idea to accept his offer. Rejecting it and trying to negotiate further might risk losing the sale, and selling to John for $120 is not a guarantee (even though it's an option, it's not a done deal until the sale is finalized). Accepting Bob's offer of $80 ensures that I get a fair price for the product and completes the sale."
