Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price for this situation:

1. Bob values the product at $15,000
2. My minimum acceptable price is $8,000 (guaranteed from John)
3. Bob will likely reject if the price is too close to $15,000
4. I should aim for a price that gives Bob some surplus while maximizing my profit
5. A price around $12,000 would split the difference between Bob's valuation and my minimum price
