"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it still allows you to make a significant profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1050000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm prepared to accept $1250000. This price still allows you a significant profit and is a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's close this deal! ",1250000.0,Alice,3,
