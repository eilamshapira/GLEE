"Bob, I'm excited to finally be able to offer you this unique opportunity. Given the immense potential and value this product holds, I'm offering it to you for $3000000. I believe this is a worthwhile investment that will generate substantial returns for you.",3000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer and highlighting the potential value of this product. However, the offer of $3000000 is significantly above my budget. I am willing to consider purchasing it for $1000000, as I believe this price better aligns with the market value and my investment plans.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While $1000000 is lower than I can realistically accept, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $2500000? This reflects a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a price that still allows you to realize substantial value from the product.",2500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. However, $2500000 is still beyond what I am prepared to pay. I can offer $1200000, which is a fair market price considering my budget limitations and the alternatives available to me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but still have some ground to cover. While I understand your budget constraints, the unique nature and potential of this product justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down further to $2000000. This is my best offer before considering other options.",2000000.0,Alice,5,
