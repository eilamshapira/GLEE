"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would really appreciate. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $115. This is a great deal, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $115 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price."
