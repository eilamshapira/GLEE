Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what price to offer Bob for my product. The product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price if Bob rejects my offer.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll need to set a price that might be acceptable to him while ensuring I make more than my minimum of $15,000.

I'll offer the product at a price that's higher than my guaranteed alternative but still potentially reasonable for Bob.
