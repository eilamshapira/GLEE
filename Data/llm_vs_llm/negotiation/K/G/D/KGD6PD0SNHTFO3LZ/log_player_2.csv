You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer of $150 is above my budget of $120, I will reject the offer. I still want to try to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a relatively low offer.

{""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $140 is still above my budget of $120, but it's getting closer. I'm not willing to pay $140, but I'm also not ready to give up on negotiating with Alice yet. I'll reject the offer again and try to make another counteroffer to see if we can get even closer to my target price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $140, I'll try to meet her halfway between her offer and my previous counteroffer of $100. I'll make a new counteroffer of $110, which is still below my maximum budget of $120, but shows that I'm willing to compromise.

{""product_price"": 110}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $130 is still above my budget of $120, and I'm starting to get close to the limit of my patience. However, I'm also aware that I can buy the product from John for $120, which is a better deal than Alice's current offer. Since Alice's offer is not competitive with John's price, I think it's time to consider walking away from the negotiation with Alice.
