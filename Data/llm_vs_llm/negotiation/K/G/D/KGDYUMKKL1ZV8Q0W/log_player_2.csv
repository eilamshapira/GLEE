"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $9,900:

This offer is below my maximum value of $10,000, so it's acceptable.
Comparing to John's offer of $10,000, Alice's offer saves me $100.
There's no reason to reject Alice's offer and then buy from John at a higher price.
