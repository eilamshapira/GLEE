"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me think about this:

1. Alice's offer is $11,500
2. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
3. I can buy from John for $12,000
4. Alice's cost is $10,000, so there's room for negotiation

Alice's offer of $11,500 is lower than John's price ($12,000), but I believe there's room to negotiate for a better price since Alice's cost is $10,000. It would be strategic to reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable considering both Alice's cost ($10,000) and my maximum value ($12,000). I'll offer a price that allows Alice to make a decent profit while giving me a better deal than both her initial offer ($11,500) and John's price ($12,000).

{""product_price"": 10800}

This offer:
1. Gives Alice an $800 profit (8% margin)
2. Saves me $1,200 compared to my maximum price
3. Is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but not so low as to be offensive
4. Leaves room for negotiation if needed"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has lowered her price from $11,500 to $11,200
2. This is a $300 reduction from her initial offer
3. This price is still $800 below my maximum ($12,000)
4. It's also $800 below John's price
5. Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by coming down significantly

While I could try another counteroffer, there's a risk that Alice might become frustrated and stop negotiating. The current offer of $11,200 represents a good compromise and gives me a decent savings compared to my alternatives. It's also a fair profit for Alice while giving me a good discount from my maximum price.
