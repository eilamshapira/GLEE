Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the same as John's guaranteed offer ($800,000), and it's also my minimum acceptable price, there's no advantage in accepting Bob's offer over John's. However, since Bob has shown interest, I'll try one more counteroffer before potentially selling to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price significantly from my initial offer but still maintain a price above my minimum to see if Bob is willing to meet me at a more reasonable point.
