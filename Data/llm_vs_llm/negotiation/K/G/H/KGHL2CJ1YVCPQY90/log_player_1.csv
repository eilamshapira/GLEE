Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. I know the product is worth at least $8,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $8,000
3. Bob's valuation is unknown, but he might value it higher
4. Since I have nothing to lose (due to John's guaranteed offer), I can aim high

I'll set a significantly higher price than my minimum value, as I can always fall back on John's offer if Bob rejects.
