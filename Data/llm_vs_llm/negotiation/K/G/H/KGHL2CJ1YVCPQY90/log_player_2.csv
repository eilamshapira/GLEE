"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to consider the offer from Alice versus buying from John.

Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is less than the $15,000 it's worth to me and less than John's price of $15,000.

Since Alice's price is lower than John's, and below my maximum value for the product, accepting Alice's offer would save me $3,000 compared to buying from John.
