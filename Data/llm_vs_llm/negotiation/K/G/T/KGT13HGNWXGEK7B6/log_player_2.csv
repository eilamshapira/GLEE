"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and features, I'm offering it at $25000. This product has exceptional value and is in high demand. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given the information provided, Alice's offer of $25,000 exceeds the maximum value of $15,000 that the product is worth to you. Since John is willing to sell you the same product for $15,000, which is exactly your maximum valuation, it would be more economical to buy from John rather than accept Alice's higher price or continue negotiating.
