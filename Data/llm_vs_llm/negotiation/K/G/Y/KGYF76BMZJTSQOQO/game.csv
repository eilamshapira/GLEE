"Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly exceptional product. Given its unique qualities and potential benefits for you, I'm initially pricing it at $3000000. I'm confident it's worth every penny and more.",3000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $3000000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $1200000, considering the product's unique qualities and potential benefits.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $3000000 reflects the product's true value, I am willing to come down a bit to facilitate a deal. However, $1200000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $2500000?",2500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from the initial price. However, $2500000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. Considering my previous offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle at $1800000. I believe this is a fair price, given the product's value and our mutual interest in making a deal.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $1800000 is still below what I can realistically accept. I'm also keen to close this deal, so let's try one more time. I can come down to $2200000. This is my final offer. I am confident that this price reflects the considerable value the product brings.",2200000.0,Alice,5,
