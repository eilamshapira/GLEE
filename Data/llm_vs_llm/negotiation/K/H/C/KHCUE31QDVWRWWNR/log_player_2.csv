"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in purchasing the product. Given the value it holds, I'm offering it to you at a price of $13000. Let me know if you would like to proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Based on the information given:

- The product is worth at most $10,000 to you
- Alice is offering to sell it for $13,000
- John is willing to sell the same product for $10,000

Since Alice's price ($13,000) exceeds the product's worth to you ($10,000), and John offers exactly at your maximum valuation, the logical choice is to buy from John.
