Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you an incredible product. I'm willing to sell it for $15000. Let me know if you're interested!,15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is quite high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $9000. This is a fair price considering current market conditions. Would you consider this offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but $9000 is too low for this product. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it for $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $13500 is still outside my budget. I've found similar products available for $12000 elsewhere. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $10500. Would that work for you?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. While $10500 is a reasonable offer, I can go a bit lower. How about $12500? I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for working with me on the price, Alice. I need to be completely transparent - I have a firm offer from another seller for $12000, and that's really the maximum I can spend on this product. However, I'd still prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer $11500, which is very close to my maximum budget. If we can't make this work, I'll unfortunately need to go with the other option.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the transparency, Bob! I understand your position. Since you have a firm offer for $12000, I can agree to a price of $12000 for you as well. Let's close the deal at that price. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,7,
