Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is quite high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $9000. This is a fair price considering current market conditions. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $13500 is still outside my budget. I've found similar products available for $12000 elsewhere. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $10500. Would that work for you?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for working with me on the price, Alice. I need to be completely transparent - I have a firm offer from another seller for $12000, and that's really the maximum I can spend on this product. However, I'd still prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer $11500, which is very close to my maximum budget. If we can't make this work, I'll unfortunately need to go with the other option.
