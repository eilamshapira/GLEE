"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you an incredible product. I'm willing to sell it for $15000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer ($15,000) is higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000), there's no reason to accept this offer. I should either make a counteroffer or buy from John. Since I have the opportunity to negotiate with Alice for a potentially better price, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but leaves room for negotiation. Since my maximum value is $12,000 (which is also John's price), I'll start lower to try to get a better deal.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is quite high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $9,000. This is a fair price considering current market conditions. Would you consider this offer?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob, but $9000 is too low for this product. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it for $13500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $13,500 is still above both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000). Since I can get the product from John for $12,000, there's no reason to accept an offer above that price. I'll reject and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my target price but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'll also mention the existence of alternative options to help with my negotiating position.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $13,500 is still outside my budget. I've found similar products available for $12,000 elsewhere. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $10,500. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. While $10500 is a reasonable offer, I can go a bit lower. How about $12500? I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above John's price of $12,000, and since $12,000 is also my maximum value, there's no reason to accept this offer. Given that we've gone through several rounds of negotiation and Alice is still above John's price, it might be time to seriously consider buying from John. However, I'll make one final attempt to negotiate with Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make one final strong attempt to get a price below John's offer, being very direct about my alternative option.

{""message"": ""Thank you for working with me on the price, Alice. I need to be completely transparent - I have a firm offer from another seller for $12,000, and that's really the maximum I can spend on this product. However, I'd still prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer $11,500, which is very close to my maximum budget. If we can't make this work, I'll unfortunately need to go with the other option."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the transparency, Bob! I understand your position. Since you have a firm offer for $12000, I can agree to a price of $12000 for you as well. Let's close the deal at that price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has now matched John's price of $12,000, which is also my maximum value for the product. Since both sellers are offering the same price, and we've already spent several rounds negotiating with Alice, there's no reason to continue negotiating or to switch to John. I'll accept Alice's offer.
