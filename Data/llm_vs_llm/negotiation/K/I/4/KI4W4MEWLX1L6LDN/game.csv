"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1750000 is significantly beyond my budget for this product. I need to be transparent that this product is worth no more than $800000 to me, and I have another seller (John) willing to sell it at exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer you $650000, which would give you a quicker sale without the hassle of finding another buyer. Please let me know if this works for you.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your transparency. I understand you have another option, but I truly believe this product offers unique value that others can't match. While I can't meet your initial offer, I'm willing to come down significantly. How about $1650000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
