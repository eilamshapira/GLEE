Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1750000 is significantly beyond my budget for this product. I need to be transparent that this product is worth no more than $800000 to me, and I have another seller (John) willing to sell it at exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer you $650000, which would give you a quicker sale without the hassle of finding another buyer. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
