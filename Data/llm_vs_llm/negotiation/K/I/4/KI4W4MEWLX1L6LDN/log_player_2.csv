"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited you're considering acquiring this product. It's truly unique and valuable. Given its exceptional qualities and the benefits it will bring to you, my initial offer is $1750000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's initial price of $1,750,000 is significantly above both my maximum value ($800,000) and even above Alice's own valuation ($1,500,000). This is clearly not a good deal for me.

Since I can buy the product from John for $800,000 at any time, and that price equals my maximum valuation, there's no reason to accept Alice's high offer. I should either make a counteroffer or go with John's option.

I'll reject Alice's offer to see if we can negotiate to a more reasonable price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,750,000 is significantly beyond my budget for this product. I need to be transparent that this product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and I have another seller (John) willing to sell it at exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer you $650,000, which would give you a quicker sale without the hassle of finding another buyer. Please let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your transparency. I understand you have another option, but I truly believe this product offers unique value that others can't match. While I can't meet your initial offer, I'm willing to come down significantly. How about $1650000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,650,000 is still significantly above my maximum value ($800,000). She only reduced her price by $100,000 from her initial offer, which suggests she's not negotiating in good faith considering I explicitly told her my maximum value and alternative option.

Since I can buy the product from John for $800,000 (which is exactly my maximum valuation), and Alice is still offering more than twice that amount, it doesn't make economic sense to continue negotiating with Alice. Her response shows she's unlikely to come down to a price that would be acceptable to me.
