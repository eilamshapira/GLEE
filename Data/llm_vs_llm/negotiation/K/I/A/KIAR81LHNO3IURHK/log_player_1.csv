Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Considering the options:

*   **Accepting Bob's offer:** Would give me $700,000, which is below my minimum.
*   **Rejecting Bob's offer and Counter Offering:** Offers the potential for a higher price, even though it's risky.
*   **Selling to John:** Guarantees $1,500,000.

I need to maximize my profit. The risk of losing the deal with Bob is always present, but so is the chance of getting a better deal than with John. My minimum price is $1,500,000. Bob's offer is way below that.

Therefore, I choose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Okay, analyzing the situation again:

*   **Accepting Bob's offer:** $800,000. Below my minimum.
*   **Rejecting Bob's offer and Counter Offering:** Risk of losing the deal, but potential for more.
*   **Selling to John:** $1,500,000. Guaranteed profit, meeting my minimum.

Bob's offers are significantly lower than my minimum. I need to decide if I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation or cut my losses and secure the $1,500,000 from John. While I would like to get a better deal, I also want to avoid a situation in which I end up with less money than I currently could.

Considering the risk and reward, I think it's time to take the safe bet.
