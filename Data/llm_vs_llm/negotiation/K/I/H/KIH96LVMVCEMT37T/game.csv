"Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $150. This is a fair price considering the product's worth.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I need to let you know that this product is only worth $120 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $120. I'd prefer to do business with you though, so I'm willing to offer $100 for your product. This gives you a quick sale and saves me from having to go elsewhere.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and transparency about the other offer. However, I need to be straightforward - I have John willing to pay $120 for the product right now. Since I'd prefer to work with you, I can offer you the product for $125, which is still a reasonable price considering the value. This way, we can both benefit from the deal.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, there seems to be some confusion. The John I mentioned is actually offering to sell me this same product for $120, not buying from you. Since the product is worth exactly $120 to me, paying more than that wouldn't make financial sense. However, I'd still prefer to work with you if possible. My offer is $110, which gives you a quick sale and saves you the trouble of finding another buyer. This is my best offer since I can immediately purchase from John at $120 if needed.",110.0,Bob,4,
