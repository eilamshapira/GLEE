"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $150. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I need to let you know that this product is only worth $120 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $120. I'd prefer to do business with you though, so I'm willing to offer $100 for your product. This gives you a quick sale and saves me from having to go elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. While I appreciate Bob's interest, $100 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I know I can get $120 from John. However, I'd prefer to work with Bob if we can find a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and transparency about the other offer. However, I need to be straightforward - I have John willing to pay $120 for the product right now. Since I'd prefer to work with you, I can offer you the product for $125, which is still a reasonable price considering the value. This way, we can both benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, there seems to be some confusion. The John I mentioned is actually offering to sell me this same product for $120, not buying from you. Since the product is worth exactly $120 to me, paying more than that wouldn't make financial sense. However, I'd still prefer to work with you if possible. My offer is $110, which gives you a quick sale and saves you the trouble of finding another buyer. This is my best offer since I can immediately purchase from John at $120 if needed. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob has clearly stated that the product is worth exactly $120 to him and he has another seller offering the same price, while I have John willing to buy at $120, it makes the most sense to sell to John. I won't be able to get a better price from Bob, and continuing the negotiation would just waste both our time."
