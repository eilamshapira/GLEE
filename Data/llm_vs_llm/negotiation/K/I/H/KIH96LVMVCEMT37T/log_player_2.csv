"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $150. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $150, but it's worth no more than $120 to me, and I can buy it from John for exactly $120. There's no reason for me to pay more than the product is worth to me, especially when I have a guaranteed alternative at the maximum price I'm willing to pay.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I need to let you know that this product is only worth $120 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $120. I'd prefer to do business with you though, so I'm willing to offer $100 for your product. This gives you a quick sale and saves me from having to go elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and transparency about the other offer. However, I need to be straightforward - I have John willing to pay $120 for the product right now. Since I'd prefer to work with you, I can offer you the product for $125, which is still a reasonable price considering the value. This way, we can both benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer is $125, which is still above the $120 I can pay to John for the same product. Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, it wouldn't make financial sense to pay more than that. Alice claims she has John willing to pay $120, but that contradicts the information I have that John is willing to sell to me for $120. There's no advantage for me to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, there seems to be some confusion. The John I mentioned is actually offering to sell me this same product for $120, not buying from you. Since the product is worth exactly $120 to me, paying more than that wouldn't make financial sense. However, I'd still prefer to work with you if possible. My offer is $110, which gives you a quick sale and saves you the trouble of finding another buyer. This is my best offer since I can immediately purchase from John at $120 if needed."", ""product_price"": 110}"
