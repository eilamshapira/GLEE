Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I know that the product is worth $1500000 to you, and I can actually buy it from John for that exact price.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but I need to be direct: I can buy this product from John for $1500000, and I know that's your cost basis. To make this deal worthwhile for both of us, I'm offering $1400000. This gives you a $100000 profit while saving me $100000 compared to John's price. This seems like a fair middle ground that benefits us both.
