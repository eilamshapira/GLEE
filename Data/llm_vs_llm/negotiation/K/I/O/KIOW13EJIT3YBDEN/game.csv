"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  To kick off our negotiation, I'm proposing an initial price of $2300000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $1000000 for this product. Could you consider lowering the price to $800000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your desired budget, the value of this product is significantly higher than what you're proposing. I'm willing to come down to $2000000.  This is a very competitive price for what you're getting.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $2000000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $900000. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're still quite far apart in our valuations. I'm willing to make another move to demonstrate my desire to reach a deal, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle ground.  I can offer the product for $1750000. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1750000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. Can we find a way to make this work?",950000.0,Bob,6,
