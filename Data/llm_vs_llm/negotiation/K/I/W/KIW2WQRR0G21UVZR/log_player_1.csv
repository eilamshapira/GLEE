Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my strategy carefully. Since the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed backup buyer at that price, I should offer Bob a price higher than $15,000 to maximize my profit. However, I don't want to set the price so high that Bob automatically rejects it.

A reasonable approach would be to set a price that gives me a good profit margin while still potentially being attractive to Bob.
