"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I should assess this situation carefully since I'm looking for a product worth no more than $1,500,000 to me.

Alice's offer is $2,000,000, which exceeds the maximum amount I'm willing to pay. If I accept this offer, I would be paying $500,000 more than the product is worth to me.

John is offering the same product for $1,500,000, which is exactly my maximum value for the product.

Since Alice's offer exceeds my maximum value and John's offer matches it exactly, the rational choice is to buy from John.
