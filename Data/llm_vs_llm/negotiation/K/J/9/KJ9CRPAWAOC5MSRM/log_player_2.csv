Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know the product is worth $120 to me, and John is willing to sell it at that price, I'll start with a lower offer to see if I can get a better deal from Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has come down from $250 to $200, showing some flexibility. However, since I can still get it for $120 from John, I'll make a counteroffer that's a bit higher than my previous one but still below John's price.

The negotiation with Alice isn't moving quickly enough toward my target price of $120 or below. Alice's offers ($250 → $200 → $180) are still well above what I can get from John. Rather than continue negotiating, it makes more sense to take John's guaranteed offer of $120, which is already my maximum acceptable price."
