"Round 1

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $100 is lower than my minimum price of $120 and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

My counteroffer is: $140

So, the response is not one of the three options you specified, but rather a counteroffer. If I had to choose one of the options, it would be:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send Bob a counteroffer of $140.
