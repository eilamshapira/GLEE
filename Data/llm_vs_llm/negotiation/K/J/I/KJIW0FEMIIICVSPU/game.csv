"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price point that works better for both of us. Given the market conditions and my research, I'd like to propose $1275000 for the product. This offers you a solid profit margin while being more aligned with current market values.",1275000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  While I value your business, I'm not quite ready to come down to $1275000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1362500? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution.",1362500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I can see you're willing to work with me on finding a fair price. While $1362500 is better, I believe we can still find a more mutually beneficial point. I can move up to $1310000, which gives you a healthy profit margin while being more in line with my budget constraints.",1310000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to go a bit further to meet your budget concerns. Let's split the difference between our last offers and set the price at $1336250. This price acknowledges your constraints while still allowing me to make a fair return on my investment.  What do you think?",1336250.0,Alice,5,
