"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'm looking for $120, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth up to $120 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $120
3. John is selling it for $120
4. The product is worth $100 to Alice, meaning she has room to negotiate

Since Alice's offer is at my maximum willingness to pay ($120) and is the same as John's price, there's no advantage in accepting her offer immediately. Given that the product is worth $100 to Alice, she might be willing to lower the price if I reject her initial offer.

The best strategy would be to reject Alice's offer first, as it might lead to a better price. If she doesn't come back with a better offer, I can still buy from John at the same price.
