"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $1,200,001, I need to compare it with my alternatives.

The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $1,500,000.

Alice's price ($1,200,001) is lower than John's price ($1,500,000) by nearly $300,000. Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, accepting Alice's offer would be the rational choice.
