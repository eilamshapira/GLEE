"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $14,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's alternative price ($10,000). It would be unwise to accept this offer. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, as there might be room for negotiation with Alice to get a better price than John's $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $8,500}

I'm offering $8,500, which is below my maximum value of $10,000 and well below Alice's initial offer. Since I know the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, this gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing me to get a better deal than John's $10,000 offer. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground, but I want to start low to have room for negotiation upward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $13,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's alternative price ($10,000). While Alice has reduced the price from her initial offer, it's still not acceptable. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round. Since we know John is willing to sell at $10,000, there's no reason to accept any price above that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $9,000}

I'm increasing my offer to $9,000, which shows some movement toward compromise while still staying below both my maximum value and John's price. This offer gives Alice a signal that I'm willing to negotiate upward, but also maintains my position that I won't pay more than $10,000. If Alice rejects this, I still have room to negotiate up to $9,500, but if the negotiation doesn't progress favorably, I always have John's $10,000 offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($12,500) is still well above John's price ($10,000)
2. Alice has only made small reductions in price (from $14,000 to $13,000 to $12,500)
3. Given that Alice's cost is $12,000, it seems unlikely she'll go below $10,000
4. We've already used half of our negotiation rounds
5. John's offer of $10,000 is already at my maximum value

There's no point continuing negotiations when we have a guaranteed option at the maximum price I'm willing to pay. Better to take John's offer now rather than risk using more rounds only to potentially end up taking his offer anyway."
