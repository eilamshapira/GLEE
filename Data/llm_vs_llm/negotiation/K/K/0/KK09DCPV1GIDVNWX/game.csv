"Hello Bob, I have a product I'd like to offer you today. It's a high-quality item with great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. Are you interested in this offer?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the quality you're highlighting, I need to be upfront that I can get this same product from another seller for $120. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer you $100 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand you mentioned getting it elsewhere for $120, which actually confirms the market value I'm aware of. While I appreciate your offer, $100 is my absolute minimum baseline as I have another buyer ready at that price point. However, I value building a relationship with you as a customer. I can come down to $130, which is still below the typical market rate and gives you a good deal. Would this work for you?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. That shows good faith in building a relationship. However, I need to be transparent that I'm not willing to pay more than the $120 I can get it for elsewhere. In fact, to make it worth changing my plans, I can offer you $110. This is still above your mentioned minimum of $100, and would give us both a win - you make the sale at above your minimum, and I save a bit compared to my alternative option. Does that work for you?",110.0,Bob,4,
