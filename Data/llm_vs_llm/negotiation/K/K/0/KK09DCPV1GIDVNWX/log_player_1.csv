Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product I'd like to offer you today. It's a high-quality item with great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the quality you're highlighting, I need to be upfront that I can get this same product from another seller for $120. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer you $100 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand you mentioned getting it elsewhere for $120, which actually confirms the market value I'm aware of. While I appreciate your offer, $100 is my absolute minimum baseline as I have another buyer ready at that price point. However, I value building a relationship with you as a customer. I can come down to $130, which is still below the typical market rate and gives you a good deal. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. That shows good faith in building a relationship. However, I need to be transparent that I'm not willing to pay more than the $120 I can get it for elsewhere. In fact, to make it worth changing my plans, I can offer you $110. This is still above your mentioned minimum of $100, and would give us both a win - you make the sale at above your minimum, and I save a bit compared to my alternative option. Does that work for you?
