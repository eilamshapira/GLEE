"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product I'd like to offer you today. It's a high-quality item with great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. Are you interested in this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $150, but I know it's worth no more than $120 to me. John is willing to sell me the exact same product for $120, which is my maximum value for it.

Since Alice's price is above both my maximum value and John's alternative price, there's no reason to accept this offer. I could try negotiating with Alice, but I already have a guaranteed option at my maximum value point.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the quality you're highlighting, I need to be upfront that I can get this same product from another seller for $120. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer you $100 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand you mentioned getting it elsewhere for $120, which actually confirms the market value I'm aware of. While I appreciate your offer, $100 is my absolute minimum baseline as I have another buyer ready at that price point. However, I value building a relationship with you as a customer. I can come down to $130, which is still below the typical market rate and gives you a good deal. Would this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has lowered her price to $130, which is better than her initial offer of $150, but it's still $10 more than John's price of $120. Since John's price is equal to my maximum value for the product, and Alice's offer exceeds that value, the rational choice is to reject this offer. I can either try one more counteroffer or go directly to John.

Since we've already had some negotiation progress with Alice reducing her price, I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer before potentially going to John.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. That shows good faith in building a relationship. However, I need to be transparent that I'm not willing to pay more than the $120 I can get it for elsewhere. In fact, to make it worth changing my plans, I can offer you $110. This is still above your mentioned minimum of $100, and would give us both a win - you make the sale at above your minimum, and I save a bit compared to my alternative option. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
