"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. The product sounds interesting, but the price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer because it's lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,200,000) and I believe I can get a better deal either from Bob in the next rounds or from John. I will proceed to the next round to send a counteroffer to Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that the initial price might be a bit high, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I can offer a slight discount from my initial price."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the adjustment. However, that's still too high for me. How about $1100000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer because it's still lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,200,000). Since Bob has increased his offer, it shows he's interested, and I believe I can get closer to my target price or at least match John's offer through further negotiation. I will proceed to the next round to send a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're willing to increase your offer, which is a good sign. I'm also willing to be flexible to ensure we can reach a deal. Considering your last offer, I can meet you halfway between my last offer and yours. Let's discuss the product at $1,450,000."", ""product_price"": 1450000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the continued negotiation. I am still a bit hesitant at that price point. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, but that's my absolute maximum.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Bob's offer has finally reached the minimum value I have for the product ($1,200,000), which is also the price John is willing to pay. Since Bob has stated this is his absolute maximum, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a higher price. Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal without risking the possibility of Bob walking away or having to sell to John for the same price."
