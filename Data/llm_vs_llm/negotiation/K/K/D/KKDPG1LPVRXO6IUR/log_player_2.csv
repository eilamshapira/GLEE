"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me. Alice is offering it for $2,000,000. If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy the product from John for $800,000. Since $800,000 is less than $2,000,000 and within my budget. I should reject the offer and buy from John.
