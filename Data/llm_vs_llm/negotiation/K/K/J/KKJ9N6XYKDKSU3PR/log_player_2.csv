"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $2,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000 and also higher than John's guaranteed price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to negotiate a better price with Alice, knowing I always have John's $800,000 offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 500000}

I'll start with a low counteroffer of $500,000. This gives me room to negotiate upward if needed, while still staying well below my maximum value of $800,000. Since I know I can always buy from John at $800,000, I want to try to secure a better deal from Alice. Starting low allows for potential back-and-forth negotiation while keeping the final price below my maximum threshold."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $2,000,000, while lower than her initial offer, is still significantly above both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's guaranteed price ($800,000). While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing her price, the current offer is still too high. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round. If Alice continues to make offers well above my maximum value, I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 600000}

I'll increase my previous offer by $100,000 to show willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a good margin below my maximum value. This offer of $600,000 shows movement in Alice's direction while keeping plenty of room for further negotiation. It's also significantly below John's price of $800,000, which would give me better value if Alice accepts. If Alice continues to counter with very high prices, I still have the option to go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice continues to lower her price, but $1,750,000 is still more than twice my maximum value of $800,000. While it's positive that Alice is gradually reducing her price, the gap between our positions is still too large. Since we're halfway through our negotiation rounds (Round 5 of 10), I'll reject and make another counteroffer. If Alice's next offers don't come down significantly, I may need to consider taking John's $800,000 offer soon to ensure I secure the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'll increase my offer to $700,000, which is still $100,000 below John's price. This represents another significant increase from my previous offer of $600,000, showing I'm serious about reaching a deal. We're now past the halfway point in our negotiations, so I'm moving closer to my maximum value to try to reach an agreement. If Alice continues to counter with prices well above my maximum value, I may need to switch to John's offer in the next few rounds to ensure I secure the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $800,000. Here's why:

1. Alice's latest offer ($1,500,000) is still nearly double my maximum value ($800,000)
2. While Alice has been lowering her price, the rate of decrease suggests we're unlikely to reach a price below $800,000 in the remaining rounds
3. We're now in Round 7 of 10, and the gap between our positions is still too large
4. John's guaranteed price of $800,000 is at my maximum value
5. There's a risk in continuing negotiations as we might run out of rounds without reaching an agreement

Rather than risk further negotiations that may not succeed, it's more prudent to secure the product at my maximum acceptable price from John."
