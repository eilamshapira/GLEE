"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Here's my decision-making process:

*   **Alice's offer:** $18,000.
*   **My limit:** $10,000.
*   **John's offer:** $10,000.

Since Alice's offer is significantly higher than both my limit and John's offer, the best course of action is to buy from John.
