"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its exceptional worth, I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that reflects its value to both of us. I believe $1400000 is a fair price, considering the product's significance and the fact that I have another interested buyer. I'm confident you'll find this offer reasonable and look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than John's price of $1,500,000, it's still significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of the product ($1,000,000). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, we might prompt Alice to propose a lower price, closer to her actual valuation, as she seems eager to sell."
