"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1200000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it represents a fantastic opportunity for you.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm excited about the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $900000 is a good starting point, it's unfortunately below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, but I'm firm on that price.  This is still a significant discount, and I'm confident the product will be a valuable asset for you. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $900000 was too low, but I'm still not comfortable with $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to propose $950000. This is a serious commitment from my side, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to $1 million to make this work. I'm offering a final price of $975000.  It's a fair price that considers both of our needs.  Let's close this deal and make this happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $975000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to stretch a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting the best value. I'd like to propose $962500. This is my highest offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value and my limitations.",962500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to meet you in the middle. Let's split the difference and finalize this deal.  I'm proposing $968750. This is a firm price, and I believe it's a fair outcome for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",968750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference. However, I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'd like to propose $965000. This is a very minor adjustment, and I believe it's a reasonable request considering we're so close to an agreement. I'm excited about the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",965000.0,Bob,8,
