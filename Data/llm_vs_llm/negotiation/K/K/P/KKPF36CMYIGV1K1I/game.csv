"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate you taking the time to consider the value of this product. While $900000 is a good starting point, I believe the true value, especially for you, is closer to the $1100000 mark. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer the product for $1100000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe $1100000 is a bit steep for me. Considering your initial price and my previous offer, I'd like to propose a compromise at $950000. I think this is a fair price that takes into account the product's value to both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thanks for coming up to $950000. I'm getting closer to a deal. However, my bottom line is $1050000. I am only willing to go down to this price. This is the best offer I can give you. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
