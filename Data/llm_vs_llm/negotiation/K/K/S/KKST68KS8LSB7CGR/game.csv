"Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Based on its features and market value, I'm offering it for $250. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",250.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my research and market comparisons, I can get similar products for much less. I would be willing to pay $75 for it. Let me know if this works for you.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is significantly below the product's value. This is a high-quality item, and I have other interested buyers willing to pay more. However, I can reduce my initial price. I can offer it to you for $200. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, considering the product's quality and market value.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $200 is still more than I can justify spending. While I understand this is a quality product, I need to stay within my budget. I can go up to $85, which is a fair increase from my previous offer. If this doesn't work for you, I understand, but I have other options available at lower prices.",85.0,Bob,4,
