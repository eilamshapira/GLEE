Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Based on its features and market value, I'm offering it for $250. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my research and market comparisons, I can get similar products for much less. I would be willing to pay $75 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $75 is too low (below my minimum of $150), but I won't sell to John yet as there might be room for negotiation with Bob to get a better price than $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is significantly below the product's value. This is a high-quality item, and I have other interested buyers willing to pay more. However, I can reduce my initial price. I can offer it to you for $200. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, considering the product's quality and market value."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $200 is still more than I can justify spending. While I understand this is a quality product, I need to stay within my budget. I can go up to $85, which is a fair increase from my previous offer. If this doesn't work for you, I understand, but I have other options available at lower prices. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $150. Bob's second offer of $85 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and his message suggests he's not willing to go much higher. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $150 (John), and Bob seems unlikely to reach a price point that would be profitable for me, it's best to take the sure deal with John."
