"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Based on its features and market value, I'm offering it for $250. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
2. John is willing to sell it for $100
3. Alice's offer of $250 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: Alice's price of $250 is far too high compared to both my maximum valuation ($100) and John's alternative offer ($100). It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. If we can't reach a deal below $100, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my research and market comparisons, I can get similar products for much less. I would be willing to pay $75 for it. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 75}

Rationale: I'm starting with a counteroffer of $75 because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $100
2. It leaves room for negotiation if Alice counters
3. If Alice rejects, I can still move up slightly while staying under my $100 limit
4. I always have John's $100 offer as a backup
5. Starting low gives me better chances of getting a good deal"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is significantly below the product's value. This is a high-quality item, and I have other interested buyers willing to pay more. However, I can reduce my initial price. I can offer it to you for $200. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, considering the product's quality and market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: 
1. Alice has dropped her price from $250 to $200, showing she's willing to negotiate
2. However, $200 is still double my maximum value ($100)
3. It's also still higher than John's guaranteed offer of $100
4. Since Alice moved significantly from her first offer, there might be room for further negotiation
5. If we can't reach an agreement below $100, I still have John's offer as a backup

I'll reject and make another counteroffer to try to reach a price below $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $200 is still more than I can justify spending. While I understand this is a quality product, I need to stay within my budget. I can go up to $85, which is a fair increase from my previous offer. If this doesn't work for you, I understand, but I have other options available at lower prices."", ""product_price"": 85}

Rationale:
1. I've increased my offer slightly from $75 to $85 to show good faith in negotiating
2. My new offer acknowledges Alice's willingness to reduce her price
3. I'm hinting at having other options (like John's offer) without explicitly mentioning it
4. I'm still well below my maximum value of $100, leaving room for one more potential negotiation round if needed
5. If Alice rejects again, I can either make one final offer closer to $100 or take John's offer at $100"
