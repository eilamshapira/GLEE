"Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2800000. This is a fair price considering the product's characteristics and potential return on investment. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",2800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for presenting your product. While it sounds interesting, your initial asking price is quite high. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $800000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but $800000 is significantly below the product's market value. I need to maintain a minimum price of $1500000, which is actually what another buyer has already offered. However, I believe this product could bring you greater value, so I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price to $2200000. This is a substantial reduction from my first offer and reflects my genuine interest in doing business with you.",2200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations is still significant.  While another buyer may exist, I'm serious about this purchase, but only within a reasonable price range.  I can go up to $1000000. This is a strong offer, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the increase in your offer. However, I must be transparent - I already have a firm offer of $1500000 from another buyer. While I prefer to work with you, I cannot accept anything below this amount as it would be a loss for me. Given this context, I'm willing to come down significantly from my previous ask to $1800000. This price still offers you great value while giving me a reasonable return. If we can't find common ground near this range, I'll need to seriously consider the other offer.",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm ready to close this deal. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000. This is my final offer, as it's reaching the top end of my budget. Let me know if this works for you, as I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
