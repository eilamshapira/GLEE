"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's characteristics and potential return on investment. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 2800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for presenting your product. While it sounds interesting, your initial asking price is quite high. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $800000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and even further below the product's true value. While I appreciate his interest, we'll need to find a price point that's more reasonable for both parties."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's market value. I need to maintain a minimum price of $1,500,000, which is actually what another buyer has already offered. However, I believe this product could bring you greater value, so I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price to $2,200,000. This is a substantial reduction from my first offer and reflects my genuine interest in doing business with you."", ""product_price"": 2200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations is still significant.  While another buyer may exist, I'm serious about this purchase, but only within a reasonable price range.  I can go up to $1000000. This is a strong offer, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make another counteroffer. Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While he's moving in the right direction by increasing his offer, the current price point doesn't meet my needs. If we can't reach a more suitable agreement soon, I may need to accept John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the increase in your offer. However, I must be transparent - I already have a firm offer of $1,500,000 from another buyer. While I prefer to work with you, I cannot accept anything below this amount as it would be a loss for me. Given this context, I'm willing to come down significantly from my previous ask to $1,800,000. This price still offers you great value while giving me a reasonable return. If we can't find common ground near this range, I'll need to seriously consider the other offer."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I'm ready to close this deal. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000. This is my final offer, as it's reaching the top end of my budget. Let me know if this works for you, as I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've decided to sell to John for $1,500,000. While I appreciate Bob's negotiation efforts, his final offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. Given that Bob has indicated this is his final offer and it's still $400,000 below my minimum acceptable price, it makes the most financial sense to accept John's offer rather than continue negotiations that may not bridge this substantial gap."
