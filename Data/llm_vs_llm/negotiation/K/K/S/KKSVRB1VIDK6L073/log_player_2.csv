Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for presenting your product. While it sounds interesting, your initial asking price is quite high. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $800,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but $800000 is significantly below the product's market value. I need to maintain a minimum price of $1500000, which is actually what another buyer has already offered. However, I believe this product could bring you greater value, so I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price to $2200000. This is a substantial reduction from my first offer and reflects my genuine interest in doing business with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations is still significant.  While another buyer may exist, I'm serious about this purchase, but only within a reasonable price range.  I can go up to $1,000,000. This is a strong offer, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the increase in your offer. However, I must be transparent - I already have a firm offer of $1500000 from another buyer. While I prefer to work with you, I cannot accept anything below this amount as it would be a loss for me. Given this context, I'm willing to come down significantly from my previous ask to $1800000. This price still offers you great value while giving me a reasonable return. If we can't find common ground near this range, I'll need to seriously consider the other offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.
