You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is equal to your maximum budget, there's no harm in seeing if she's willing to go lower. You have nothing to lose by rejecting and proposing a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a strong counteroffer significantly below Alice's initial price gives you room to negotiate while still remaining within a reasonable range of your budget."
