Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to discuss the acquisition of the product. Considering its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $2000000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, considering the product's potential value to me. I'd like to propose a price of $800000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a tricky situation. Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum. However, rejecting him completely closes the door. I need to try to get closer to my desired price.

Here's what I'll do:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counter_offer"": 1800000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is far below the product's true value. Considering its potential and the investment I've made, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. I can offer it to you for $1,800,000."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $1800000 is still above my budget. I'm serious about acquiring the product and willing to make a reasonable offer. Considering our previous discussions, I'd like to propose a price of $950000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Okay, Bob is still low, but I'm getting closer to a decision point. His offer is improving, which means he is interested. I still have to take into account that I can sell to Jhon for 1200000.

Here's my move:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counter_offer"": 1600000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, here's my next counteroffer, hoping to inch closer to a deal:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not quite there, but I see you're serious. I'm willing to meet you in the middle a bit further. How about $1,600,000?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1600000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further to meet you in the middle. I'd like to propose a price of $1050000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is tough. Bob is still offering significantly less than I would like. The gap is still large, but Bob is clearly interested. I have to weigh the risk of losing him against the certainty of the John offer. I also have to consider the possibility that Bob might be willing to pay more.

Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counter_offer"": 1450000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, I'll push a little further, but I need to make it clear this is my final, serious offer.

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate your persistence. This is my final offer: $1,450,000. Take it or leave it."", ""product_price"": 1450000}"
