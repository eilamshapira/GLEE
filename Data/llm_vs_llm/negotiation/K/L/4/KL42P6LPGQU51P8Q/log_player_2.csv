"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While I'm willing to pay $15,000, there's no harm in seeing if Alice might accept a lower price. It's the first round, and I have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a significantly lower offer gives me more room to negotiate upwards if needed. This offer tests Alice's bottom line and helps me understand her valuation of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice reducing her price by $2,000 suggests there's room for further negotiation. While $13,000 is getting closer to an acceptable price, I believe I can still get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 11500}

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to move, but not by much. This keeps me in the running while still aiming for a price significantly lower than her initial offer and John's alternative."
