"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $25000, which I think is a fair price considering its features and market value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe the product is of high quality, $25000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it. I believe this is a fair offer considering my budget constraints.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $8000 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand budget constraints, I need to ensure a fair return on this high-quality product. I can reduce my initial asking price to $21000, which I believe is still a competitive price for the value you'll receive. Would you consider this revised offer?",21000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $21000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10000.  This represents a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your interest in the product. However, I must be transparent - I cannot go below $18000 for this product. This is already a significant reduction from my initial asking price and represents excellent value for the quality you'll receive. Given your previous offers, I'm willing to hear your thoughts on this new price point.",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're firm on the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  How about $14000? This shows I'm committed to making a deal, but I also need to stay within a reasonable budget.",14000.0,Bob,6,
