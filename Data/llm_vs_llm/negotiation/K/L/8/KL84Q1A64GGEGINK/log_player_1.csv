"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $25,000, which I think is a fair price considering its features and market value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe the product is of high quality, $25000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it. I believe this is a fair offer considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $8,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, so I cannot accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $8,000 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand budget constraints, I need to ensure a fair return on this high-quality product. I can reduce my initial asking price to $21,000, which I believe is still a competitive price for the value you'll receive. Would you consider this revised offer?"", ""product_price"": 21000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $21000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10000.  This represents a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make another counteroffer. Bob's offer of $10,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and since Bob's increases are relatively small, I should continue negotiating but be prepared to sell to John if we can't reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your interest in the product. However, I must be transparent - I cannot go below $18,000 for this product. This is already a significant reduction from my initial asking price and represents excellent value for the quality you'll receive. Given your previous offers, I'm willing to hear your thoughts on this new price point."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're firm on the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  How about $14000? This shows I'm committed to making a deal, but I also need to stay within a reasonable budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $14,000 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $15,000, and we've gone through several rounds of negotiation with Bob only slowly increasing his price, it makes more business sense to take the guaranteed higher amount from John. There's no certainty that Bob will reach or exceed $15,000 in future rounds, and we've already used 6 of our 10 rounds."
