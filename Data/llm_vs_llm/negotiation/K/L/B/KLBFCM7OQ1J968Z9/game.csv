,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $240 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, as I know it's worth $150 to you. Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. $100 is a bit too low for me, as I value this product at least $150. How about we meet in the middle at $195? I'm confident you'll see the value once you start using it.",195.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $195 is still a bit too high for me. I'm comfortable going to $125. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you as well.  Let's try to close this deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
