"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe you'll find valuable. I’m offering it to you for $12000. Let me know if you’re interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $12,000
3. John is willing to sell it for $8,000

Since:
- Alice's offer ($12,000) is significantly higher than my maximum value ($8,000)
- John's offer ($8,000) matches my maximum value
- Buying from Alice would mean overpaying by $4,000

The logical choice is to buy from John, as it's the most economical option and matches my maximum value threshold.
