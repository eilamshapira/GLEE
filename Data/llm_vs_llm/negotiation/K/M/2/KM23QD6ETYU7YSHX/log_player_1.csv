Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit higher than I was expecting. I'm looking to spend no more than $12000. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, I will reject his offer. I still believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that my initial price was higher than you expected. However, I still believe the product has a higher value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $16000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle of our last two offers. How about $14000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and also close to the offer from John, I need to consider the risks and benefits of further negotiation. Given that Bob's offer is only $1,000 less than John's offer, and I don't know if Bob will be willing to increase his offer further, I think it's reasonable to accept John's offer of $15,000, which is a sure deal.
