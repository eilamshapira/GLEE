"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its exceptional worth, I'm setting the price at $1200000. If you're interested, please let me know and we can finalize the sale. If not, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she is selling the product for $1,200,000, which is $300,000 less than what John is offering ($1,500,000). Since the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, and Alice's price is below that ceiling, it makes financial sense to accept her offer and save $300,000.
