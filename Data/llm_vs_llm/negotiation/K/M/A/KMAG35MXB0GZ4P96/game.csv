"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, I believe $9500 is a bit steep. Given current market conditions, I would be willing to purchase the product for $8500, which still provides you with a healthy profit margin. This offer represents a fair value for both of us. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $8500. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I need to consider my bottom line as well. The product is of premium quality and I've already offered it below its market value. I'm willing to come down to $9200, which still gives you an $800 value gain. This represents a fair compromise between our positions. Does this work for you?",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I think we can find a middle ground that works better for both of us. The market has several comparable options, and I know John is offering the same product as well. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $8800, which gives you a solid $800 profit margin. This is a fair price that benefits us both. Would you consider this offer?",8800.0,Bob,4,
