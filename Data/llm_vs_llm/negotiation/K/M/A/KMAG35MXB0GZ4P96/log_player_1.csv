Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, I believe $9500 is a bit steep. Given current market conditions, I would be willing to purchase the product for $8500, which still provides you with a healthy profit margin. This offer represents a fair value for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I think we can find a middle ground that works better for both of us. The market has several comparable options, and I know John is offering the same product as well. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $8800, which gives you a solid $800 profit margin. This is a fair price that benefits us both. Would you consider this offer?
