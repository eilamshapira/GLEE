"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $1,000,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a high offer to Bob to see if there's potential for making more than my guaranteed amount.

{""product_price"": 1,200,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $650,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and John's guaranteed offer ($1,000,000), and even below Bob's own valuation ($800,000), I will reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's previous offer was quite low at $650,000, but I know the product is worth $800,000 to him, I'll reduce my price somewhat but still keep it well above his valuation to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 1,100,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer of $700,000 is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000. Since I already know I can get $1,000,000 from John, and Bob's offers are still far below that, I will choose to sell to John now rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to exceed John's offer.
