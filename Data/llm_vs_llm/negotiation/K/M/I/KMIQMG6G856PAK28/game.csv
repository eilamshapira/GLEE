"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's quality and potential value, my budget is limited. I can offer $500000 for the product. Would you consider this proposal?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $500000 is too low for this product's value. I can offer it for $2000000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. This better reflects both the product's worth and shows my willingness to negotiate. Would you consider this revised offer?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I'm working within a strict budget. How about we settle at $750000? I believe this could be a fair compromise for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
