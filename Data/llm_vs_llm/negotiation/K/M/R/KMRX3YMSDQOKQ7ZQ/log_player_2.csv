"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is the same as John's price.  There's no reason to accept immediately. By rejecting and counter-offering, I have a chance to get a better price from Alice without risking a worse outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 100}

**Reasoning:** This is a significant price drop from Alice's initial offer. It tests the waters and gives us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice reducing her price indicates a willingness to negotiate. There's still room to go lower than $120 before reaching John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 110}

**Reasoning:** I'm moving closer to her price, but in smaller increments to signal I'm looking for a good deal but willing to negotiate."
