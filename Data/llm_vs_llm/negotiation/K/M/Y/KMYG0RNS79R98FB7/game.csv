"Hello Alice, thanks for offering your product! While it seems nice, $180 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider a significantly lower price, say around $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $80 is too low for this product's value. Given its quality and features, I couldn't go below $150. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would this price work better for you?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate the discount. However, $150 is still a bit too high for me. Could you meet me halfway at $115? I think that's a fair price considering both our positions.",115.0,Bob,4,
