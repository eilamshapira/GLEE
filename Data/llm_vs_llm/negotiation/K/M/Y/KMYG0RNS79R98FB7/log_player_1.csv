Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its features and value, I'm offering it for $180. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for offering your product! While it seems nice, $180 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider a significantly lower price, say around $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer because:
1. Bob's offer of $80 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $120
2. I already have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, so I won't accept anything lower
3. Since Bob is negotiating, there's a chance to get more than $120 by continuing the negotiation
4. Starting at $80 suggests Bob might be willing to go higher

I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $80 is too low for this product's value. Given its quality and features, I couldn't go below $150. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would this price work better for you?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate the discount. However, $150 is still a bit too high for me. Could you meet me halfway at $115? I think that's a fair price considering both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John because:
1. Bob's offer ($115) is still below John's guaranteed price ($120)
2. Based on Bob's negotiation pattern (starting at $80 and only moving up to $115), it seems unlikely he'll exceed $120
3. There's no reason to accept less than what John is offering
4. Continuing negotiations might lead to Bob getting frustrated or walking away, while John's offer is certain

Therefore, the most rational decision is to take John's guaranteed $120 offer."
