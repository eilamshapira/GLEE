Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $80 is too low for this product's value. Given its quality and features, I couldn't go below $150. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would this price work better for you?

While Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's still above my budget and what John offers. I believe I can negotiate a better deal."
