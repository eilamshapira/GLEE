"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $120
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: $120

In this case, Alice's offer ($120) is the same as John's price ($120). Since both prices are equal and at my maximum value threshold ($120), there's no economic advantage to choosing one over the other. I might as well accept Alice's offer since we're already in negotiations with her.
