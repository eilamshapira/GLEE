"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product, I'll start by making a relatively high offer. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially settle on a higher price.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is lower than the minimum value of $12,000 that I have for the product, I will reject his offer. Selling the product to John for $12,000 is a safer option, but I still want to try to negotiate with Bob to see if I can get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $10,000, which is lower than my minimum value, I'll make a counteroffer that is still relatively high, but slightly lower than my initial offer. This will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still expect a good price for the product.

{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $12,000 is exactly the minimum value that I have for the product, and it's also the same price that John is willing to pay. Since I don't know if Bob will increase his offer further, and I already have a guaranteed sale to John at the same price, I'll choose to accept Bob's offer. This way, I can close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation not yielding a better price.
