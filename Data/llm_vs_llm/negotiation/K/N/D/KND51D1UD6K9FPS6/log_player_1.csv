Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what price to offer Bob. Since the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, I should offer Bob a price higher than this amount.

Without knowing Bob's maximum willingness to pay, I'll make a reasonable offer that provides me with a good profit while still being potentially acceptable to Bob.
