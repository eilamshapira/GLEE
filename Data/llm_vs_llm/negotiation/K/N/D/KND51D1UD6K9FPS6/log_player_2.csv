"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Alice's offer: $12,000
2. John's price: $15,000
3. My maximum value for the product: $15,000

Alice's offer ($12,000) is:
- Lower than my maximum value ($15,000)
- Lower than John's price ($15,000)
- Saves me $3,000 compared to buying from John

Since Alice's offer is below my maximum value and provides significant savings compared to John's price, it makes sense to accept her offer.
