"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

```json
{""product_price"": 2500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **High initial anchor:** I'm starting with a price significantly above my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000). This is a negotiation tactic to establish a high anchor point, influencing Bob's perception of the product's value.
*   **Potential Upside:** I have no idea how much Bob values this product. He might be willing to pay a premium. Starting high allows me to capture that upside if it exists.
*   **Room to Negotiate:** Starting high gives me ample room to negotiate downwards in subsequent rounds if Bob rejects my initial offer. I can concede some ground without falling below my bottom line.
*   **Early Indication of Interest:** Bob's response to this offer will provide valuable information about his interest level and potential budget. If he immediately rejects it, I'll know I need to adjust my strategy significantly. If he counters, even at a low price, it indicates he sees some value.
*   **The ""John"" option is my safety net.** Knowing I can always fall back on the $1,500,000 offer from John allows me to be more aggressive in my initial offer without fear of complete loss."
