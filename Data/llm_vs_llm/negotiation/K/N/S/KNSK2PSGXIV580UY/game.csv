"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling me this product. However, I believe your asking price is quite high considering market conditions. I understand the product's value, but I'm looking for a more competitive price. I'd like to offer $1100000 for the product, which I believe is fair and still provides you with a good profit margin.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. It shows we're making progress toward an agreement. However, there's still quite a gap between our positions. I believe a fair middle ground would be $1175000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer while still giving you a healthy profit. This price works well within my budget constraints while recognizing the value of your product. What do you say?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
