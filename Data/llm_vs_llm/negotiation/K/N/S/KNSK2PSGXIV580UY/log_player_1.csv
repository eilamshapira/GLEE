"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling me this product. However, I believe your asking price is quite high considering market conditions. I understand the product's value, but I'm looking for a more competitive price. I'd like to offer $1100000 for the product, which I believe is fair and still provides you with a good profit margin. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is higher than John's offer of $1,000,000, it's worth continuing the negotiation to try to get a better price. However, $1,100,000 is still lower than the initial offer of $1,400,000, so a counteroffer will be made to try to meet in the middle or get closer to the desired price.

Next, a counteroffer will be sent to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000, considering the product's value and market conditions. I believe this price is more reflective of the product's worth and is still a competitive offer."", ""product_price"": 1,300,000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. It shows we're making progress toward an agreement. However, there's still quite a gap between our positions. I believe a fair middle ground would be $1175000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer while still giving you a healthy profit. This price works well within my budget constraints while recognizing the value of your product. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000.

Since Bob's offer of $1,175,000 is still lower than the desired price, and considering that Bob is willing to increase his offer, it's worth continuing the negotiation to try to get a better price. $1,175,000 is higher than John's offer of $1,000,000, so it's still beneficial to keep negotiating with Bob.

Next, a counteroffer will be sent to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground.
