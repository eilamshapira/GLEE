"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to consider Alice's offer of $950,000 carefully. 

The product is worth up to $1,000,000 to me, and I can always buy it from John for $1,000,000 as my fallback option.

Alice's current offer of $950,000 saves me $50,000 compared to buying from John. However, the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation to get a better price.

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer to try to save more money, which is my goal.

I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating to try to get a better price. Even if we don't reach the ideal price, I'm already saving $75,000 compared to John's price, but I believe I can save more.
