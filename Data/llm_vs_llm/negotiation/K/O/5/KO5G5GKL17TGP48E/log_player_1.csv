(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($8,000), but still lower than my initial offer, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

My counteroffer will be $10,500. 

So, my decision is:

My decision is: {""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
