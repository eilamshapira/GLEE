Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider the right price to offer to Bob. I know the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and I have John as a backup buyer at exactly $15,000.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll set a price that:
1. Is significantly higher than my minimum ($15,000)
2. But not so high that Bob is likely to reject it outright

{""product_price"": $25,000}"
