"Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer ($25,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($15,000) and John's alternative offer ($15,000), it would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. The best decision would be to buy from John.
