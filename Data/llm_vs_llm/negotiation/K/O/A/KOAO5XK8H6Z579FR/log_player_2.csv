"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value for the product ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000), I should reject this offer. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer when I can buy from John for a lower price, but I should try negotiating with Alice first to potentially get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's well below John's price to give room for negotiation while still providing potential savings compared to John's offer.

{""product_price"": $8,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price from $18,000 to $16,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still higher than John's price of $12,000, so accepting this offer wouldn't make sense. I should continue negotiating with Alice to try to get a better price than John's $12,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer slightly while still staying below John's price to show some movement in the negotiation.
