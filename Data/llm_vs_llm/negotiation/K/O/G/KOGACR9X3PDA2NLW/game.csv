"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, I'm currently looking to spend no more than $90. Would you consider selling it for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $90 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. I can offer the product to you for $100, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.",100.0,Alice,3,
