Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, I'm currently looking to spend no more than $90. Would you consider selling it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $90 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go.
