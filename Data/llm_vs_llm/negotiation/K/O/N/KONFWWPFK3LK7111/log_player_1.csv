"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is lower than the minimum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,500,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I will also not sell it to John immediately, as there's a possibility that Bob might increase his offer in the next round. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

My counteroffer to Bob is $2,500,000."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still lower than the offer from John of $1,500,000, and I'm trying to maximize my earnings, I will reject Bob's offer. However, I will not sell it to John yet, as Bob's offer is getting closer to John's, and there's a possibility that Bob might increase his offer further.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is very close to the offer from John of $1,500,000, and I'm trying to maximize my earnings, I will reject Bob's offer because it's still lower than John's offer. However, I will not make another counteroffer to Bob because the difference between Bob's offer and John's offer is relatively small, and further negotiation may not yield a significantly better result.
