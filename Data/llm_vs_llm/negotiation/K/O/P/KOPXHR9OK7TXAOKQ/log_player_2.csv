"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this exclusive product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm willing to let it go for a price of $11900. This is a one-time offer, and if you reject it, I will have to sell it to another buyer who is waiting in line. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency and scarcity, but the offer is still quite close to your maximum budget.  There's a chance you could get a better price by rejecting the offer and seeing if Alice is willing to come down."
