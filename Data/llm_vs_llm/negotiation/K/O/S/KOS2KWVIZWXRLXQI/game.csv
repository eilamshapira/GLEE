"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its market value and unique features, I'm offering it at $2000000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential value to your business.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe $2000000 is above my budget for this product. After researching the market, I think a more reasonable price would be $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $1200000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I have another buyer willing to pay $1500000, but I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price to $1750000, which is still a fair value considering the product's worth.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $1750000 is still above what I'm willing to pay. Considering you mentioned another buyer is willing to pay $1500000, I'm willing to meet you closer to that price. I'll offer $1400000, which I believe is a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
