"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its market value and unique features, I'm offering it at $2,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential value to your business."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe $2000000 is above my budget for this product. After researching the market, I think a more reasonable price would be $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I want to continue negotiations with Bob to potentially get a better price than John's offer, I won't accept anything below $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $1,200,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I have another buyer willing to pay $1,500,000, but I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price to $1,750,000, which is still a fair value considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $1750000 is still above what I'm willing to pay. Considering you mentioned another buyer is willing to pay $1500000, I'm willing to meet you closer to that price. I'll offer $1400000, which I believe is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $1,500,000. Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still below John's guaranteed offer, and given that Bob knows about John's offer but is still proposing a lower price, it seems unlikely that Bob will increase his offer above $1,500,000 in future rounds. It's best to secure the guaranteed higher amount rather than risk further negotiations that might not improve."
