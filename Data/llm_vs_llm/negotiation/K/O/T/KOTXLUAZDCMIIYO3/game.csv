"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11500?  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my value for the product. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I understand we both want a fair deal. How about $9000? This would still be a significant saving for me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
