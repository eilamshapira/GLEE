"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the offer from Alice ($1,500,000) is above my maximum budget of $1,000,000, it doesn't make sense to accept it. Additionally, buying from John for $1,000,000 is within my budget, but I'd like to try negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price that's lower than $1,000,000. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range, considering my maximum budget is $1,000,000. Let's start with a counteroffer of $750,000.
