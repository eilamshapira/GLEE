"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's qualities, my budget is a bit tight. I believe a fair value for both of us would be $800000. Let me know if we can proceed at this price.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be transparent that $800000 is my absolute minimum floor price for this product - it's exactly what I could get from another interested buyer. Given the product's exceptional value and potential return on investment, I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer. I can offer it to you for $1050000, which I believe represents excellent value. I'm interested in working with you specifically, but I do need to ensure a fair return on my end as well.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
