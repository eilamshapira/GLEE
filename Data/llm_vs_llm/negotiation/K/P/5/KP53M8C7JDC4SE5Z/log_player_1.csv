Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be transparent that $800,000 is my absolute minimum floor price for this product - it's exactly what I could get from another interested buyer. Given the product's exceptional value and potential return on investment, I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000, which I believe represents excellent value. I'm interested in working with you specifically, but I do need to ensure a fair return on my end as well."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
