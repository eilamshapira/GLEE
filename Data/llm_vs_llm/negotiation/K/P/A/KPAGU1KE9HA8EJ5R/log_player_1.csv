"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$6,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 (which I can get from John). I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, lowering my initial price but still keeping it well above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price significantly from my initial offer but still maintain a good margin above my minimum of $15,000.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $6,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. His small increase from $6,000 to $6,500 suggests he might not be willing to reach a price that would be acceptable to me. However, I'll try one more time with a lower counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a more significant reduction in my asking price, but still maintain it well above my minimum threshold.

{""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offers have only increased by small increments ($6,000 -> $6,500 -> $7,000), and he's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Given that we've gone through several rounds and Bob doesn't seem willing to approach a reasonable price point, it's best to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John rather than continue this negotiation that shows little promise of reaching an acceptable price."
