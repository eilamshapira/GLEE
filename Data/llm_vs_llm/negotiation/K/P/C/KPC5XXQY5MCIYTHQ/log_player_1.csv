"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $150. This is a fair price considering the quality and value of the product."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and I know the product is worth $100 to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $80 is too low for this product. I know the product's value to you is $100, and that's also my minimum acceptable price. I can offer it to you for $120, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for working with me, Alice. I really want this product, and I'm willing to go up to $90. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know if you can accommodate this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob is still offering below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and I know I can sell to John for $100, it makes more sense to take John's guaranteed offer rather than continue negotiating with Bob who seems reluctant to meet the minimum price."
