"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer is $1,200,000, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and buying from John would cost the same, I see no benefit in rejecting the offer or buying from John. Therefore, I will accept Alice's offer.
