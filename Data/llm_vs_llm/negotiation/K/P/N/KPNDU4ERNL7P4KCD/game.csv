"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit lower than I'm willing to sell it for. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $130.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your revised offer. I'd like to propose a price of $75. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $75 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to sell the product for. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $115. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value.",115.0,Alice,5,
