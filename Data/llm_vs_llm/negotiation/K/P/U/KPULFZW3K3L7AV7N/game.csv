"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has tremendous value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting with a price that reflects its worth.",5000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
That price is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I value the product at a much lower price. My initial offer is $500000.,500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that my initial price may have been higher than you expected. However, I still believe the product has a much higher value than $500000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'll lower my price, but not as low as your offer.",3750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, but it's still far beyond what I can justify. I am willing to increase my offer to $550000.",550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $550000 is still below my expectations. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to see a more substantial move from your side. I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and your current offer.",2125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $2125000 is simply too high for me. I can offer $600000.",600000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've been considering your last offer, and I appreciate the incremental increases. However, I still believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm going to make a more significant concession this time to try and meet you halfway, but I need you to consider the product's true worth.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
This is my best and final offer. I can go up to $750000.,750000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've thought carefully about your final offer, and I appreciate the effort you've put into our negotiation. However, I must prioritize the value I believe the product holds. Given that we're near the end of our negotiation and your last offer was $750000, I'm going to make a slight adjustment to my previous counteroffer, hoping it might change your perspective or demonstrate my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,9,
