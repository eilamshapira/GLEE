"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has tremendous value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 5000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That price is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I value the product at a much lower price. My initial offer is $500000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $500,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and I believe the product is worth more. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is an option, but I'd like to explore the possibility of getting a better price from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that my initial price may have been higher than you expected. However, I still believe the product has a much higher value than $500,000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'll lower my price, but not as low as your offer."", ""product_price"": 3750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, but it's still far beyond what I can justify. I am willing to increase my offer to $550000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly lower than my last proposal. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to find a better price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is becoming a more attractive option, but I'll give Bob another chance to meet me closer to my desired price. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $550,000 is still below my expectations. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to see a more substantial move from your side."", ""product_price"": 3000000}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $550,000 is still below my expectations.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $2125000 is simply too high for me. I can offer $600000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $600,000 is still below my target, but I notice he's incrementally increasing his bids. I'll continue to negotiate, hoping to find a mutually acceptable price. Since Bob is slowly moving up, I'll make a smaller adjustment in my counteroffer to encourage further negotiation.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I see you're willing to increase your bid, which is a positive step. However, $600,000 is still not where I need it to be. I'll make a smaller concession this time, hoping we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1750000}"

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I've been considering your last offer, and I appreciate the incremental increases. However, I still believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm going to make a more significant concession this time to try and meet you halfway, but I need you to consider the product's true worth."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my best and final offer. I can go up to $750000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's best and final offer of $750,000 is still below the price I'm willing to accept, and it's also below the offer from John. Since Bob has stated this is his final offer, I don't see a benefit in continuing to negotiate with him at this point. However, I'll consider one last attempt to meet in the middle before making a final decision.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but $750,000 is still not acceptable to me. As you've indicated this is your last offer, I must consider my other options. I'm willing to make one last concession, but it would require you to reconsider your 'final' stance."", ""product_price"": 875000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I've thought carefully about your final offer, and I appreciate the effort you've put into our negotiation. However, I must prioritize the value I believe the product holds. Given that we're near the end of our negotiation and your last offer was $750,000, I'm going to make a slight adjustment to my previous counteroffer, hoping it might change your perspective or demonstrate my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
