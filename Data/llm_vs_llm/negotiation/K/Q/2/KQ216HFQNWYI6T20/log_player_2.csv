"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its exceptional quality and rarity, I believe it's worth a premium price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000, which I think is a fair price considering its value. If you're interested, please let me know and we can finalize the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $8,000
2. Alice is offering the product for $20,000
3. John is willing to sell it for $8,000

Since:
- Alice's price ($20,000) is way above my maximum value ($8,000)
- John's price ($8,000) equals my maximum value
- Buying from Alice would mean paying $12,000 more than my maximum value
- John's offer is the better option

The logical choice is to buy from John.
