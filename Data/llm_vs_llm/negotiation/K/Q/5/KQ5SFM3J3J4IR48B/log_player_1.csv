Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that:
1. The product is worth $10,000 minimum to me
2. The product is worth $8,000 to Bob
3. I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000

There's no reason for me to offer the product to Bob for less than $10,000, as I can get that amount from John. Since $10,000 is above Bob's valuation of $8,000, he will likely reject this offer, but that's acceptable as I can then sell to John.
