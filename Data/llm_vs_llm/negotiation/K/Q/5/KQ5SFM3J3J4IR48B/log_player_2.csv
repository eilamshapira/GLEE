"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $10,000, I need to evaluate whether this is a good deal for me.

The product is worth at most $8,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it to me for $8,000. Alice's offer of $10,000 exceeds both my maximum valuation and the alternative offer from John.

Since Alice's price ($10,000) is higher than both my maximum valuation ($8,000) and John's offer ($8,000), the logical choice is to buy from John.
