"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Considering that the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $800,000, Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is clearly not a good deal. It's almost double what the product is worth to me, and much higher than John's alternative offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's well below Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,450,000 is still significantly higher than both what the product is worth to me and John's alternative price of $800,000. Since I can get the same product from John for $800,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer which is still $650,000 more expensive.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's counter was still very high, I'll increase my offer slightly but remain well below John's price to give us room to negotiate.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,400,000 is still $600,000 higher than John's price of $800,000. Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, Alice's price is still far too high to be acceptable. John's offer remains the better option.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer again but still keep it well below John's price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still considerably higher than John's price of $800,000. Alice has reduced her price by only small increments, suggesting she's not going to come down to a price that would be competitive with John's offer anytime soon. Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and John is offering exactly that price, it makes the most sense to buy from John.
