"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's offer.

The product is worth up to $120 to me (my maximum valuation).
Alice is offering it for $100.
If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $120.

Alice's offer ($100) is $20 less than John's price ($120), so I would save $20 by accepting Alice's offer.

Given that my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, accepting Alice's offer is the rational choice.
