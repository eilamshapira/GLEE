Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $10,000 to Bob
2. My minimum acceptable price is $8,000
3. If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed $8,000 from John
4. Bob knows his maximum value ($10,000) but doesn't know my minimum ($8,000)
5. To maximize my profit, I should price it close to Bob's maximum value while keeping it attractive enough for him to accept

I'll offer a price that gives Bob some incentive to buy while maximizing my profit:

{""product_price"": 9500}

This price:
- Gives Bob $500 in value ($10,000 - $9,500)
- Gives me $1,500 more than my fallback option with John
- Is likely low enough below Bob's maximum to motivate him to accept"
