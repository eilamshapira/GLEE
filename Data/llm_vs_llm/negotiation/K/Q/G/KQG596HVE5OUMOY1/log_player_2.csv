"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $9,500
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: $10,000

The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and I want to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $9,500 is $500 less than John's price of $10,000. While Alice's profit margin is high ($1,500), her price is still better than John's offer. Rejecting without a counter-offer would leave me with only John's higher price option.

Therefore, the most economical choice is to accept Alice's offer.
