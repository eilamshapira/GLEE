Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your time and consideration. However, I was hoping for a more competitive price. I am willing to offer $11000 for the product, especially as I have other options available. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $11,000 is lower than what I can get from John ($12,000), and it's also lower than the product's worth to me, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better price.

Here's my counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was hoping for a more substantial offer, considering its value. I'm willing to reconsider the price, but I need something closer to its worth. I can offer it to you for $14,000."", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $11500. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.

Since Bob's offer of $11,500 is still lower than what I can get from John ($12,000), and it's also lower than the product's worth to me, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better price.

Here's my counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price, but I still need something closer to the product's value.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the adjustment, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12000. I believe this price is fair and beneficial for both parties.

Although Bob's offer of $12,000 is equal to what I can get from John, I know that the product is worth more to Bob ($15,000). I'll try to negotiate a better price, as I believe there's still room for improvement.

Here's my counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I see that we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial price.
