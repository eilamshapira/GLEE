Bob's offer:

I appreciate your position, but I must respectfully decline $8,000 as it's significantly below the product's value. The product is worth at least $15,000 to me, which is what another buyer is currently offering. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can reduce my asking price to $19,500.
