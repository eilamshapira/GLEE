"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in purchasing. It's a high-quality item with excellent features and performance. Based on its market value and unique characteristics, I'm offering it to you for $22000. I believe this represents a fair price considering the product's quality and capabilities. Are you interested in making this purchase?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest and counteroffer. I appreciate your position, but I must respectfully decline $8000 as it's significantly below the product's value. The product is worth at least $15000 to me, which is what another buyer is currently offering. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can reduce my asking price to $19500. This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's quality and market value. Would this be more agreeable to you?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $10000, which shows your genuine interest in the product. However, that price still falls below what I can accept, as I have a guaranteed offer of $15000 from another buyer. I understand budget constraints, but the product's quality and value justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $17500, which is a significant reduction from my original asking price. This represents my best effort to accommodate your budget while still receiving fair compensation for the product. Would this work for you?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand we're still some distance apart on price. I appreciate your increased offer to $11000, but I need to be transparent that I have a standing offer of $15000 from another buyer. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. My final offer would be $16000, which is just slightly above my alternative option and represents a substantial 27% discount from my initial asking price. This is truly the lowest I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me. Can we reach an agreement at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

It seems unlikely Alice will go much lower than $16,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of pushing her away entirely. John's offer of $12,000 is a sure thing and saves me a significant amount of money."
