"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value you see in the product, but considering my budget constraints, I'm more comfortable at a price closer to $1000000. How about we settle at $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I must decline that offer as it's substantially below the product's true value. I have another buyer willing to pay $1500000, so I cannot go below that price point. However, I'm willing to be flexible from my initial offer. Would you consider $2100000? This price better reflects the product's actual value while still offering you good potential for returns.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your flexibility. However, my budget is still quite tight. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1300000. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
