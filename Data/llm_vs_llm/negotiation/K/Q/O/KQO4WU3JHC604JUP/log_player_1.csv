"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,500,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential returns."", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value you see in the product, but considering my budget constraints, I'm more comfortable at a price closer to $1000000. How about we settle at $1000000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll follow up with a counteroffer. $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price, as it's even lower than John's standing offer. I need to continue negotiating for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I must decline that offer as it's substantially below the product's true value. I have another buyer willing to pay $1,500,000, so I cannot go below that price point. However, I'm willing to be flexible from my initial offer. Would you consider $2,100,000? This price better reflects the product's actual value while still offering you good potential for returns."", ""product_price"": 2100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your flexibility. However, my budget is still quite tight. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1300000. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll take John's offer of $1,500,000. Bob's latest offer is still $200,000 below John's guaranteed price, and given Bob's slow rate of increase in his offers, it seems unlikely we'll reach a better price than John's offer within the remaining rounds. It's more prudent to secure the guaranteed higher amount now."
