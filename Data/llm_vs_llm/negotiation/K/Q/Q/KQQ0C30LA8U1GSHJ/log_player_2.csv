"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my premium product to you for $13000. It's a great value and I believe it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Looking at this situation:

- The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
- Alice is offering it for $13,000
- John is willing to sell it for $10,000

Since Alice's offer ($13,000) exceeds the maximum value the product has to me ($10,000), and John offers exactly the maximum value I place on it, the best financial decision would be to buy from John.
