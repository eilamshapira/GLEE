"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be very interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice is offering to sell the product for $15,000, which is $5,000 more than my maximum valuation of $10,000. Since John is willing to sell the same product for $10,000, it wouldn't make sense to accept Alice's current offer.

I could try to negotiate with Alice by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer, but since I already have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $10,000, and that's the maximum value the product has to me, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
