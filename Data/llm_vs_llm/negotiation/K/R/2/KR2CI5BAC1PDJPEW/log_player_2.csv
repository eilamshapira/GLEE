"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $14,000
3. John is willing to sell it for $10,000

Since Alice's offer ($14,000) is:
- Higher than the product's worth to me ($10,000)
- Higher than John's offer ($10,000)

The rational decision would be to buy from John, as it will save me $4,000 compared to Alice's offer and matches the maximum value I place on the product.
