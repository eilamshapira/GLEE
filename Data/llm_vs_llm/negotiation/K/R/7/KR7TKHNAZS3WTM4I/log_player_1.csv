Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I have the option to sell to John for $150, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I will also not sell to John immediately, as there is a possibility that Bob may increase his offer in subsequent rounds. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be $140, which is slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price, to see if Bob is willing to meet me closer to my target price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer of $70 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Since I have the option to sell to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price, I don't see a need to continue negotiating with Bob at this point.
