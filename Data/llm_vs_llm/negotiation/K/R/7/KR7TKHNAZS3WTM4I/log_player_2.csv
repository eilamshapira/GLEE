"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $150 is too high, as the product is only worth $80 to me. Since John is willing to sell it for $80, I should not accept any price higher than that. I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 60}

I'll offer $60, which is below my maximum value of $80. This gives room for negotiation while still keeping the price below my maximum acceptable price. If Alice rejects this, I can either increase my offer in subsequent rounds (while staying below $80) or ultimately go to John if we can't reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $140 is still way too high, as I can get the same product from John for $80. Since the product is only worth $80 to me, I would lose money by accepting Alice's offer of $140. I'll reject and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

I'll increase my offer to $70, which is still below my maximum value of $80. This shows some willingness to negotiate upward while maintaining a good margin below my maximum price. If Alice continues to reject offers and maintain prices well above $80, I'll eventually go to John's fixed price of $80."
