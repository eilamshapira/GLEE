"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity. Given the immense value this product holds and its potential benefit to you, my initial offer is $1600000.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a significantly lower price, considering my budget constraints. I'd be willing to make a serious commitment if we can meet at a more reasonable price point.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but the inherent value of this product is substantial. I also have another buyer, John, willing to buy the product for $1200000. How about we meet in the middle for $1400000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still above my budget. Considering you mentioned another buyer willing to pay $1200000, I'd like to make a more competitive offer while staying within my means. I'm willing to meet you at $900000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $900000 is still too low for me. While I value your interest, I also have John ready to pay $1200000. To make this worthwhile for me, I'd need to be closer to that figure. How about we settle at $1300000? This would give you a slight advantage over John.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1300000 is still significantly above my budget. Given that I'm a serious buyer and we've already had several rounds of discussion, I'm willing to stretch my budget slightly. I'd like to propose a price of $950000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise between our positions.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with $950000. Knowing I can get $1200000 from John, I'd need a more compelling offer from you. I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $1250000. That's the lowest I can realistically go.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $1250000 is still beyond my budget. Given that we're both serious about making a deal, I'm willing to make one final stretch. I'd like to propose a price of $1000000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and our respective positions.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
