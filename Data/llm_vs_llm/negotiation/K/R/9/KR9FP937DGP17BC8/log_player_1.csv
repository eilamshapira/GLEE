Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Considering you mentioned another buyer willing to pay $1200000, I'd like to make a more competitive offer while staying within my means.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1300000 is still significantly above my budget. Given that I'm a serious buyer and we've already had several rounds of discussion, I'm willing to stretch my budget slightly. I'd like to propose a price of $950000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise between our positions.
