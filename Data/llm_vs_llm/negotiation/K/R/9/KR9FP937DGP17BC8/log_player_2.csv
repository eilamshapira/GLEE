Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $900000 is still too low for me. While I value your interest, I also have John ready to pay $1200000. To make this worthwhile for me, I'd need to be closer to that figure. How about we settle at $1300000? This would give you a slight advantage over John.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
