"Alice's offer: The product price will be $149. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $149
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: Pay $149
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: Pay $100

Since:
- The product is worth no more than $100 to me
- John is offering the product for $100
- Alice's offer ($149) is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price

The rational decision is to buy from John, as it saves me $49 compared to Alice's offer and matches my maximum valuation.
