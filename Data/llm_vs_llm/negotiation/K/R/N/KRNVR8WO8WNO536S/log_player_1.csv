Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I was hoping to spend a bit less. How about I offer you $7000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer because:
1. Bob's offer of $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000
2. Even John's offer ($8,000) is better than Bob's current offer
3. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, there's room for negotiation to reach a better price

I'll continue negotiating with Bob to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $7,000 is too low for this product's value. Given its quality and features, I cannot go below $10,000. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents good value for what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm trying to manage my budget. Can we settle on $8200? This way, both of us can walk away with a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $8,200 because:
1. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000
2. It's better than John's standing offer of $8,000
3. While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk Bob might withdraw and we'd have to settle for John's lower offer
4. The difference between this offer and John's offer is positive, even if small, so it's the rational choice"
