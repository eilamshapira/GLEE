"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to make a decision about purchasing a product. Let me analyze the options:

The product is worth no more than $80 to me.
Alice is offering it for $200.
John is offering it for $80.

Since Alice's offer ($200) is significantly higher than the product's value to me ($80), and it's also higher than John's price ($80), the rational choice is to buy from John.
