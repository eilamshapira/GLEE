"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer is $15,000, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and buying from John would cost the same, I might as well buy from Alice to save the hassle of going to another seller.
