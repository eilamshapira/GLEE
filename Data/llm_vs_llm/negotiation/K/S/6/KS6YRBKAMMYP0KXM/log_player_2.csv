"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it for $119.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth up to $120 to me (my maximum value)
2. Alice is offering it for $119
3. John is willing to sell it for $120

Alice's offer is $119, which is just $1 less than John's price of $120. While Alice's offer is technically better than John's, the difference is minimal. However, since my goal is to save as much money as possible while still getting the product, and both prices are within my maximum value of $120, I should accept Alice's slightly better offer.
