"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $110
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John at $120

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and:
- The product is worth up to $120 to me
- Alice's offer is $110
- John's price is $120

Alice's offer at $110 is $10 less than John's price at $120. Therefore, accepting Alice's offer would save me money while still getting the product I want.
