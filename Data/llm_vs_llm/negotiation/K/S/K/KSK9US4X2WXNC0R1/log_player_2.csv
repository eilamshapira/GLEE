"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know the product is worth $15,000 to Alice and John is willing to sell it for $15,000, I'll make a reasonable counteroffer below that price to try to get a better deal.

{""product_price"": 13500}

This offer gives Alice some profit while being lower than John's price, making it a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer ($16,500) is still higher than John's price ($15,000), it's more economical to buy from John. There's no reason to pay $1,500 more for the same product, and given that Alice started at $18,000 and only came down to $16,500, it seems unlikely that she'll go below John's price in future negotiations."
