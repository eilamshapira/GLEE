"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's exclusivity, your asking price is significantly above my budget. Based on my market research and needs, I can offer $600000 for the product. This is a fair and substantial offer that I hope you'll consider.",600000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, the price you've proposed is significantly below the value of the product. I'm countering with an offer of $3000000, which I believe more accurately reflects its worth and exclusivity. I hope you'll reconsider at this price point.",3000000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value this product brings is substantial. I'm willing to come down to $2500000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still reflects the product's true worth. I hope this revised offer aligns better with your valuation while still recognizing the product's exclusivity.",2500000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you reducing your price, Alice, and I understand this is a valuable product. However, $2.5 million is still far beyond what I can justify for this purchase. I can increase my offer to $700000, which is a significant amount and represents the upper range of what I can reasonably invest in this product. This offer reflects both my sincere interest in the product and my practical budget constraints.",700000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your increased offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $700000 is still below what I can accept for this product. I'm willing to further lower my price to $2000000. This is a considerable discount from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair compromise given the product's unique value. I hope you can see the potential at this price.",2000000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Given your budget constraints and the value of the product, I'm prepared to lower my offer further to $1800000. This price reflects a significant reduction and I believe it's a strong offer that recognizes both the product's worth and your financial considerations. I hope this meets your needs and we can finalize the deal.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
