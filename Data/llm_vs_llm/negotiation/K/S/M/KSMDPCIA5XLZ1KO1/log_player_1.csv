Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's exclusivity, your asking price is significantly above my budget. Based on my market research and needs, I can offer $600000 for the product. This is a fair and substantial offer that I hope you'll consider.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you reducing your price, Alice, and I understand this is a valuable product. However, $2.5 million is still far beyond what I can justify for this purchase.
