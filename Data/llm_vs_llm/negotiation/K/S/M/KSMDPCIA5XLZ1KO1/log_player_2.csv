"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have an exclusive product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $5000000. This is a one-time opportunity to acquire something truly unique at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that my maximum value for the product is $800,000, and Alice's initial offer is $5,000,000 (which is more than 6 times my maximum value), I should either reject this offer and make a counteroffer, or buy from John. Since John's price matches my maximum value, it's a safe backup option, but I should first try to negotiate with Alice for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's significantly below my maximum value, leaving room for negotiation while still being respectful.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's exclusivity, your asking price is significantly above my budget. Based on my market research and needs, I can offer $600,000 for the product. This is a fair and substantial offer that I hope you'll consider."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value this product brings is substantial. I'm willing to come down to $2500000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still reflects the product's true worth. I hope this revised offer aligns better with your valuation while still recognizing the product's exclusivity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $2,500,000 is still more than three times my maximum value of $800,000. While she has made a significant reduction from her initial offer, it's still far above what I'm willing to pay. I should continue negotiating since we have more rounds available, but I need to be mindful that I have John's offer as a backup.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer somewhat to show willingness to negotiate, but still stay well below my maximum value.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you reducing your price, Alice, and I understand this is a valuable product. However, $2.5 million is still far beyond what I can justify for this purchase. I can increase my offer to $700,000, which is a significant amount and represents the upper range of what I can reasonably invest in this product. This offer reflects both my sincere interest in the product and my practical budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Given your budget constraints and the value of the product, I'm prepared to lower my offer further to $1800000. This price reflects a significant reduction and I believe it's a strong offer that recognizes both the product's worth and your financial considerations. I hope this meets your needs and we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","While Alice continues to lower her price, $1,800,000 is still more than twice my maximum value of $800,000. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and while Alice is moving down in price, she's still far above my maximum value. Given that John's offer of $800,000 exactly matches my maximum value, and Alice seems to be anchored at much higher prices, it's becoming more practical to take John's offer rather than continue negotiations that may not reach my target range.
