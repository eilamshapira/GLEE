"Hi Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be of great value to you. Based on market research and the quality of this product, I'm offering it to you for $2500000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential return on investment. I'd be happy to discuss this further if you have any questions about the product.",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is significantly above my budget. I understand you're offering a premium product, but I have other options available, including a similar product for $1000000 from another seller. I value your product and would like to work with you, but I can offer $800000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market conditions.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your offer. However, $800000 is significantly below the product's market value and my own investment in it. I understand you mentioned having alternatives at $1000000, but I can assure you that our product offers superior quality and features that justify a higher price point. I have another buyer who is willing to pay $1500000, which represents my absolute minimum acceptable price. However, I would prefer to work with you. I can come down to $2000000, which is a $500000 reduction from my initial offer and represents excellent value considering the product's capabilities. Would you be willing to reconsider?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you reducing your price, but $2000000 is still well above what I can justify spending. While I'm sure your product has superior features, I need to be realistic about my budget constraints. You mentioned having another buyer at $1500000, but I still need to stay within my financial limits. I can increase my offer to $950000, which is very close to what I'd pay elsewhere, showing how serious I am about working with you specifically. This is nearly a 20% increase from my previous offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $950000. I do appreciate your interest in working with me specifically, but I must be transparent that this figure is still substantially below what I can accept. As I mentioned, I have a guaranteed offer of $1500000 from another buyer, which represents my absolute minimum threshold. Given our ongoing negotiation and my genuine interest in working with you, I'm willing to offer you the product at $1700000 - which is a significant $800000 reduction from my initial price and only $200000 above my guaranteed alternative. This represents exceptional value and demonstrates my commitment to potentially establishing a business relationship with you. Would you consider this offer?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
