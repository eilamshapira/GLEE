Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is significantly above my budget. I understand you're offering a premium product, but I have other options available, including a similar product for $1000000 from another seller. I value your product and would like to work with you, but I can offer $800000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your offer. However, $800,000 is significantly below the product's market value and my own investment in it. I understand you mentioned having alternatives at $1,000,000, but I can assure you that our product offers superior quality and features that justify a higher price point. I have another buyer who is willing to pay $1,500,000, which represents my absolute minimum acceptable price. However, I would prefer to work with you. I can come down to $2,000,000, which is a $500,000 reduction from my initial offer and represents excellent value considering the product's capabilities. Would you be willing to reconsider?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you reducing your price, but $2000000 is still well above what I can justify spending. While I'm sure your product has superior features, I need to be realistic about my budget constraints. You mentioned having another buyer at $1500000, but I still need to stay within my financial limits. I can increase my offer to $950000, which is very close to what I'd pay elsewhere, showing how serious I am about working with you specifically. This is nearly a 20% increase from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $950,000. I do appreciate your interest in working with me specifically, but I must be transparent that this figure is still substantially below what I can accept. As I mentioned, I have a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from another buyer, which represents my absolute minimum threshold. Given our ongoing negotiation and my genuine interest in working with you, I'm willing to offer you the product at $1,700,000 - which is a significant $800,000 reduction from my initial price and only $200,000 above my guaranteed alternative. This represents exceptional value and demonstrates my commitment to potentially establishing a business relationship with you. Would you consider this offer?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
