"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be of great value to you. Based on market research and the quality of this product, I'm offering it to you for $2500000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential return on investment. I'd be happy to discuss this further if you have any questions about the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $2,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,000,000, and it's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $1,000,000. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, as there might be room for negotiation to get a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I understand you're offering a premium product, but I have other options available, including a similar product for $1,000,000 from another seller. I value your product and would like to work with you, but I can offer $800,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market conditions."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your offer. However, $800000 is significantly below the product's market value and my own investment in it. I understand you mentioned having alternatives at $1000000, but I can assure you that our product offers superior quality and features that justify a higher price point. I have another buyer who is willing to pay $1500000, which represents my absolute minimum acceptable price. However, I would prefer to work with you. I can come down to $2000000, which is a $500000 reduction from my initial offer and represents excellent value considering the product's capabilities. Would you be willing to reconsider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $2,000,000 is still double my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price. While she mentions having another buyer at $1,500,000, this could be a negotiation tactic. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, but if we can't get closer to my target price soon, I'll need to consider John's option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you reducing your price, but $2,000,000 is still well above what I can justify spending. While I'm sure your product has superior features, I need to be realistic about my budget constraints. You mentioned having another buyer at $1,500,000, but I still need to stay within my financial limits. I can increase my offer to $950,000, which is very close to what I'd pay elsewhere, showing how serious I am about working with you specifically. This is nearly a 20% increase from my previous offer."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $950000. I do appreciate your interest in working with me specifically, but I must be transparent that this figure is still substantially below what I can accept. As I mentioned, I have a guaranteed offer of $1500000 from another buyer, which represents my absolute minimum threshold. Given our ongoing negotiation and my genuine interest in working with you, I'm willing to offer you the product at $1700000 - which is a significant $800000 reduction from my initial price and only $200000 above my guaranteed alternative. This represents exceptional value and demonstrates my commitment to potentially establishing a business relationship with you. Would you consider this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I will choose to buy from John for $1,000,000. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($1,700,000) is still significantly above my maximum value ($1,000,000)
2. Alice keeps mentioning a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000, which suggests she won't go below that price
3. We've had multiple rounds of negotiation but remain far apart on price
4. John's price ($1,000,000) exactly matches my maximum value
5. Continuing negotiations seems unlikely to result in a better deal than John's offer

Given these factors, it's best to end the negotiation and take John's guaranteed offer rather than risk more rounds of unsuccessful negotiation."
