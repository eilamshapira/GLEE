,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $140 seems quite high for this product. Given market conditions, I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, this product offers significant value, and $140 is a fair reflection of that. I could come down slightly to $130, but that's my best offer.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down to $130, Alice. However, I've done my market research, and while this is a good product, similar items are selling for much less. I can raise my offer to $115, which I believe is a fair price that works for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
