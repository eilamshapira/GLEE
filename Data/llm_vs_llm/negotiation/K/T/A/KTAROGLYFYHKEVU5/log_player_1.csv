Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $140 seems quite high for this product. Given market conditions, I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
