"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you have a certain budget in mind, but I'm afraid $7000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering the product's value to you is $10000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to propose a price of $9000.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. This price is still below my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price to $7500. However, I'm still looking for a price that's a bit closer to the product's value to you. Considering you're willing to pay up to $10000, I'd like to propose a price of $8500. This is a compromise that takes into account your budget and the product's worth to both of us.",8500.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm still not comfortable with $8500. I'd like to propose a price of $8000, which is very close to your initial value of $8000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's worth, and I'm hoping we can agree on this.",8000.0,Bob,6,
