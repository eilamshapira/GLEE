Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this:

1. The product is worth at least $8,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $8,000
3. Since Bob's valuation is unknown, it's worth trying a higher price
4. If Bob rejects, I lose nothing as I can still sell to John
5. I'll aim significantly higher than $8,000 to maximize potential profit
