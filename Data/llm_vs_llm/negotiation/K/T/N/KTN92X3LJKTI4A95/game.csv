"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $20000 is far too high for me. While I appreciate the product's quality, I have another seller offering the same product for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable price. Would you consider $6000 for the product?",6000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest in the product, $6000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. Let me know if this works for you.",18000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
