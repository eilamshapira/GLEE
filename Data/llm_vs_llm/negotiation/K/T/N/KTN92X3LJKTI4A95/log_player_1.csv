Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $20000 is far too high for me. While I appreciate the product's quality, I have another seller offering the same product for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable price. Would you consider $6000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
