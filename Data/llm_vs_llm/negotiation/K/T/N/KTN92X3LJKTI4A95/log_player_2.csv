"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $20000. This is a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: The offer of $20,000 is way above my maximum value of $8,000 (what the product is worth to me). It's also significantly higher than John's guaranteed offer of $8,000. It would be unwise to accept this offer. I'll reject and make a counteroffer, since there's a chance I might be able to negotiate with Alice for an even better price than John's $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $20,000 is far too high for me. While I appreciate the product's quality, I have another seller offering the same product for $8,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable price. Would you consider $6,000 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 6000}

Rationale: I'm starting with a lower offer ($6,000) for a few reasons:
1. It's below John's price of $8,000, giving me room to negotiate up if needed
2. It's still above Alice's cost ($5,000), so there's potential for profit on her side
3. Starting low allows room for negotiation while keeping John's offer as a backup
4. I mentioned the competing offer to give context for my lower price and create urgency"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest in the product, $6000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Rationale: Alice's new offer of $18,000 is still more than double my maximum value of $8,000. While she did reduce the price from her initial offer, the reduction is not significant enough to make it worthwhile. Additionally, her message suggests she's not willing to come down to a price anywhere near my target range, as she called $6,000 ""significantly below"" her minimum acceptable price. Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value ($8,000), it's best to take his guaranteed offer rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to result in a better deal."
