"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your alternative option of buying from John.  You should definitely negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 750000}

This is a classic negotiation tactic: start with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price (but still hopefully reasonable). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above your fallback option of buying from John for $1,200,000. There's room for further negotiation."

I'm moving closer to Alice's price, but still leaving room for negotiation before reaching my upper limit. This offer represents a significant discount from Alice's last offer and might be tempting for her to accept."
