"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $60. How about we settle at $85? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $75. This is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to meet in the middle. I can come down a bit more, but the lowest I can go is $80. This is the best price I can offer, considering the value of the product to both of us.",80.0,Alice,5,
