"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $25000. What do you say?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and I can actually get it from another seller, John, for exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $7500 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to another seller.",7500.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $7500 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your valuation and my initial offer. How about $17500? This is a significant discount from my original price and reflects my interest in doing business with you.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm keen to find a solution that works for both of us. Considering your last offer and my need to maintain a certain value for the product, I'm proposing a new price of $15000. This is a further reduction from my previous counteroffer and demonstrates my flexibility. What are your thoughts on this?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I need to be transparent that I can purchase this same product from John for $10000, which is already the maximum value this product has to me. For me to continue doing business with you instead, I'd need a better price than that. I'm willing to offer $8500. This would save me $1500 compared to John's price, and would allow us to close this deal quickly without further negotiation.",8500.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your transparency and your desire to close the deal quickly. However, $8500 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to go down to $12500, which is a significant compromise from my side, but it also ensures that I can still do business with you at a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand the urgency to reach an agreement. Considering your constraints and my need to maintain a certain value, I'm proposing a final offer of $11000. This price is just above what John is offering you, and it allows us to conclude our negotiation successfully. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,
