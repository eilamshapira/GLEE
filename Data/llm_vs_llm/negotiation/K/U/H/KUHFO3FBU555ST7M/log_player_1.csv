"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $25,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and I can actually get it from another seller, John, for exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $7500 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your valuation and my initial offer. How about $17,500? This is a significant discount from my original price and reflects my interest in doing business with you.""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm keen to find a solution that works for both of us. Considering your last offer and my need to maintain a certain value for the product, I'm proposing a new price of $15,000. This is a further reduction from my previous counteroffer and demonstrates my flexibility. What are your thoughts on this?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I need to be transparent that I can purchase this same product from John for $10000, which is already the maximum value this product has to me. For me to continue doing business with you instead, I'd need a better price than that. I'm willing to offer $8500. This would save me $1500 compared to John's price, and would allow us to close this deal quickly without further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your transparency and your desire to close the deal quickly. However, $8,500 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to go down to $12,500, which is a significant compromise from my side, but it also ensures that I can still do business with you at a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.""}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand the urgency to reach an agreement. Considering your constraints and my need to maintain a certain value, I'm proposing a final offer of $11,000.
