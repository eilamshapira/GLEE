"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $25000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that Alice's offer ($25,000) is actually higher than the maximum value of the product to me ($10,000) and also higher than John's guaranteed price ($10,000), it doesn't make sense to accept this offer. I should either counter-offer or go with John's option.

Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value ($10,000), I should try to negotiate with Alice first to see if I can get a better deal before resorting to John's option.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and I can actually get it from another seller, John, for exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $7,500 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to another seller."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm keen to find a solution that works for both of us. Considering your last offer and my need to maintain a certain value for the product, I'm proposing a new price of $15000. This is a further reduction from my previous counteroffer and demonstrates my flexibility. What are your thoughts on this? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $15,000 is still above both my maximum value for the product ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000). While Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, it still doesn't make financial sense for me to accept this offer.

Since John is offering the product at $10,000, I should try one more counteroffer with Alice to see if she'll come down to a price below John's before deciding to go with John's option.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I need to be transparent that I can purchase this same product from John for $10,000, which is already the maximum value this product has to me. For me to continue doing business with you instead, I'd need a better price than that. I'm willing to offer $8,500. This would save me $1,500 compared to John's price, and would allow us to close this deal quickly without further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the urgency to reach an agreement. Considering your constraints and my need to maintain a certain value, I'm proposing a final offer of $11000. This price is just above what John is offering you, and it allows us to conclude our negotiation successfully. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above John's price of $10,000, and since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, it doesn't make financial sense to accept Alice's offer. While she has come down significantly, John's option is still better for me.

Since the difference is now only $1,000, I could try one more counteroffer, but given that Alice specifically called this her ""final offer"" and the fact that John's price matches my maximum valuation, it makes more sense at this point to simply buy from John.
