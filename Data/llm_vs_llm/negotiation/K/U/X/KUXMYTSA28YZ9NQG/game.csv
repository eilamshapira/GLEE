"Hi Bob, I'm offering this fantastic product for sale! It's a real gem and I think you'll find it incredibly valuable. I'm asking $200 for it.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is way above my budget. Given that I can get a similar product elsewhere for $100, I'd be willing to offer $75 for your product.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $75 is a bit too low for me. The product is of very high quality, superior to what you might find elsewhere for $100. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $160.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $160 is still significantly above what I can pay. While your product might be of higher quality, I can't justify paying that much more. I can go up to $85, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.",85.0,Bob,4,
