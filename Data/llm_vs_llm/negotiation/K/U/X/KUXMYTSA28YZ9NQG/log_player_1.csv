Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $160 is still significantly above what I can pay. While your product might be of higher quality, I can't justify paying that much more. I can go up to $85, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.
