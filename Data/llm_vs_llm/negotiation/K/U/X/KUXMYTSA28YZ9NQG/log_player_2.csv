"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this fantastic product for sale! It's a real gem and I think you'll find it incredibly valuable. I'm asking $200 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer of $200 is higher than both my maximum budget ($100) and John's price ($100), it wouldn't make sense to accept it. While I could buy from John immediately, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first to potentially get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is way above my budget. Given that I can get a similar product elsewhere for $100, I'd be willing to offer $75 for your product."", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $75 is a bit too low for me. The product is of very high quality, superior to what you might find elsewhere for $100. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $160. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $160 is still well above both my maximum budget ($100) and John's price ($100). While Alice has moved down from her initial price, it's still not competitive with my alternative option. I'll reject and try one more counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a slightly higher offer than my previous one, but still keep it under John's price to make it worthwhile for me.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $160 is still significantly above what I can pay. While your product might be of higher quality, I can't justify paying that much more. I can go up to $85, which is the absolute maximum I can afford."", ""product_price"": 85}"
