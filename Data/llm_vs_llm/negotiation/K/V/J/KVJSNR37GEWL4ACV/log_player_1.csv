Send your offer to Bob.,"Looking at the situation, I need to price my product strategically:

1) The product is worth $150 to Bob
2) It's worth at least $80 to me
3) If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell to John for $80

Since Bob values the product at $150, I could charge up to that amount, but he likely won't accept if he gets no benefit. I want to offer a price that gives Bob some incentive while maximizing my profit. If I offer too high, he might reject and I'd only get $80 from John.

A reasonable approach is to offer Bob a price that splits some of the surplus value, but weighted in my favor since I have the alternative buyer.
