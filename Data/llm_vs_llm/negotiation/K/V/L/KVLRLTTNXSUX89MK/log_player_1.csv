"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know Bob's valuation of the product, I'll start with a relatively high price to allow room for negotiation while ensuring I get significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the same as John's guaranteed offer ($10,000), and this is just round 2 out of 10, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate for a better price. There's no risk in continuing negotiation at this point since I can always fall back on John's offer later.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still maintain a price significantly above my minimum to leave room for further negotiation.

{""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob has increased his offer from $10,000 to $13,000, which is a significant improvement and shows he's willing to negotiate upward. This offer is already $3,000 better than John's guaranteed offer, so I'll accept it.
