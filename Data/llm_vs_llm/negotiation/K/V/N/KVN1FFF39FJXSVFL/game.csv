"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the value I place on the product, I'm willing to offer $850000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your prompt response and the effort to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I must admit that $850000 is lower than I had anticipated. Considering the product's value and the initial price I set, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer the product to you for $1050000, which I believe is a fair price that takes into account both our interests.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still outside of my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $950000 for the product. This price is fair, and allows for a successful transaction. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and find a mutually beneficial agreement. Splitting the difference is a fair approach, but I still feel that $950000 is slightly lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'd like to propose a price of $1000000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
