Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your prompt response and the effort to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I must admit that $850000 is lower than I had anticipated.

I'd like to offer the product to you for $1050000, which I believe is a fair price that takes into account both our interests.

# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and find a mutually beneficial agreement. Splitting the difference is a fair approach, but I still feel that $950000 is slightly lower than I'm comfortable with.
