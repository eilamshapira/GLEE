"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice is offering the product for $9,500, while John has it for $10,000.

Looking at the values:
- The product is worth $10,000 to me (my maximum value)
- Alice's cost is $8,000
- Alice's current offer is $9,500
- John's fixed price is $10,000

Alice's current offer saves me $500 compared to John's price, but there's potentially room to negotiate further since Alice's cost is $8,000. If I reject and make a counteroffer, we might find a price that's better for me while still profitable for Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice that gives her a decent profit while saving me more money compared to her initial offer or John's price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has come down by $200 from her initial offer, which shows some willingness to negotiate. She's now offering $9,300 compared to her initial $9,500. While this is better and already $700 less than John's price, there's still room for further negotiation since her cost is $8,000.

I'll reject this offer and try another counteroffer, as the negotiation seems to be moving in a positive direction.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer to show good faith in the negotiation while still trying to get a better price than Alice's latest offer.
