"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $11000. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You can try to get a better price by rejecting it. There's a chance she'll come down, and even if she doesn't, you're still willing to buy from John for $12,000."
