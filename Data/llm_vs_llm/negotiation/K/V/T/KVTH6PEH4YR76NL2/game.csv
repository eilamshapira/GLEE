"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I do see the potential value in what you're offering, $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I would like to propose a price of $800000, which I believe is fair given the alternatives available to me. I look forward to your thoughts on this.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This still allows for a substantial profit for you and ensures the product's value is reflected in the price.  Let's discuss further and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
