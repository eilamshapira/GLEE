"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I do see the potential value in what you're offering, $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I would like to propose a price of $800000, which I believe is fair given the alternatives available to me. I look forward to your thoughts on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This still allows for a substantial profit for you and ensures the product's value is reflected in the price.  Let's discuss further and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
