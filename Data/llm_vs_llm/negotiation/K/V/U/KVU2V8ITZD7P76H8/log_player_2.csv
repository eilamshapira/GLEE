"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since the product is worth $15,000 to me and Alice's offer is $14,000, which is less than what I'm willing to pay, I should consider accepting the offer. However, I also want to save as much money as possible. Given that Alice's worth for the product is $12,000, there might be room for negotiation to get a better price.

Therefore, my decision is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer, hoping to get a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $14,000 and her worth for the product is $12,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than her initial offer but still reasonable, considering I want to save as much money as possible.

My counteroffer will be $12,500, which is slightly above Alice's worth for the product. This gives her a bit of an incentive to accept, as she'll still be making a profit, while also being closer to my target of saving money.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has made a new offer of $13,500, which is lower than her previous offer of $14,000 but still higher than my counteroffer of $12,500.

Considering that Alice's worth for the product is $12,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation. However, I also need to keep in mind that I can buy the product from John for $15,000, and Alice's current offer is $1,500 less than that.

Since Alice has already come down by $500 from her initial offer, I'm hoping she might be willing to come down a bit more. But I also don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.

My decision is to reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer, trying to meet in the middle between my previous offer and Alice's current offer.

My new counteroffer will be $13,000, which is still lower than Alice's current offer but closer to it. This offer is also higher than my previous counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually beneficial price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has rejected my previous counteroffer of $13,000 and made a new offer of $13,200, which is only $200 more than my previous counteroffer.

At this point, I've negotiated the price down from the initial $14,000 to $13,200, which is a significant reduction. Considering that Alice's worth for the product is $12,000, she's already making a decent profit.

Given that the difference between Alice's current offer and my previous counteroffer is relatively small ($200), and considering that I can buy the product from John for $15,000, I think it's reasonable to accept Alice's current offer.

My decision is to accept Alice's offer and buy the product for $13,200.
