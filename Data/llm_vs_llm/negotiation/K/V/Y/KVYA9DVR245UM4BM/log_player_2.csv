"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to present you with a unique opportunity to acquire a highly valuable product. I'm offering it to you for $1800000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than both:
1. My maximum value for the product ($800,000)
2. John's alternative offer ($800,000)

The logical choice is to buy from John. There's no reason to pay $1,800,000 when I can get the same product for $800,000, which is also my maximum valuation.
