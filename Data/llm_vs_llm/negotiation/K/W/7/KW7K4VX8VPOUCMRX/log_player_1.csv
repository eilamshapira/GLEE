"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value of $12,000 that the product is worth to me, and also lower than my initial offer, I will reject Bob's offer.

My counteroffer will be $18,000, slightly lower than my initial offer to show willingness to negotiate, but still reflecting the product's value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $2,000 is still far below the minimum value of $12,000 that the product is worth to me. While it's an increase from his previous offer, it doesn't come close to reflecting the product's true value.

I will reject Bob's offer again and consider making another counteroffer. However, since Bob's offers have been very low, I might need to think about selling to John for $12,000 if Bob's next offer isn't significantly higher.

For now, I'll make another counteroffer, trying to meet Bob somewhere in the middle, but still ensuring I get a fair price for the product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $3,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $3,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $3,000 is still significantly lower than the minimum value of $12,000 that the product is worth to me. Although he has been gradually increasing his offer, the pace is slow, and we are still far apart.

At this point, I'm starting to lose patience and think that selling to John for $12,000 might be a better option. It's a guaranteed sale at a price that I know is acceptable to me, whereas negotiating with Bob is taking a long time and may not yield a satisfactory result.

I'll reject Bob's offer again, but I'm not going to make another counteroffer. Instead, I'll give Bob one last chance to meet me at a reasonable price. If he doesn't, I'll sell to John.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $4,000 is still far below the minimum value of $12,000 that the product is worth to me. We've been negotiating for several rounds, and while Bob has been increasing his offer, the progress is slow.

At this point, I don't think it's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob. His offers have been consistently low, and I don't see a path to reaching a mutually agreeable price.

Given that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, which is the minimum value I'm willing to accept, I've decided to end the negotiation with Bob and sell the product to John.
