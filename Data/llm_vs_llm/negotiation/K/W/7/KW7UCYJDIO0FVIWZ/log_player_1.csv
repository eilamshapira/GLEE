Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14,000. It's a great value and I think you'll be very pleased with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject Bob's offer, since I would earn more by selling to Jhon. I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, because I think he might be willing to pay more than $12,000. I will lower my price, but not below $13,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit too high. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a great deal and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $13000 is still a bit high for me. Could you go down to $11000? I think that would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer of $11,000 is too low, and I don't think I can reach a satisfactory price with him. I'd rather sell the product to John for $10,000 than accept Bob's offer or continue negotiating."
