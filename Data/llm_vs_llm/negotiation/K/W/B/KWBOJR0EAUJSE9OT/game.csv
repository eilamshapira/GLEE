"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is too high for me. I know another seller who's offering the same product for $10000. But I'd like to do business with you if possible. Would you consider selling it for $8500? This would give me a reason to choose you over the other seller.",8500.0,Bob,2,
