"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to offer you the product for $15000. Please let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $15,000 is above my maximum value of $10,000, and it's even higher than John's fixed price of $10,000. It would be better to either make a counteroffer to Alice or buy from John, but definitely not accept this high price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is too high for me. I know another seller who's offering the same product for $10,000. But I'd like to do business with you if possible. Would you consider selling it for $8,500? This would give me a reason to choose you over the other seller."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
