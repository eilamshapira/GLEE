"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is close to but still below my maximum budget of $1,500,000, and I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I'll choose to reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer. This gives me a chance to potentially negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable, considering I know the product's worth to Alice is $1,200,000. My goal is to save as much money as possible while still being realistic about the negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has lowered her price to $1,400,000, which is getting closer to what I consider a good deal, but I still think there's room for negotiation since the product is worth $1,200,000 to her. Given that my maximum budget is $1,500,000 and I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I'll choose to reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer. This approach allows me to potentially get an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice rejected my previous offer of $1,000,000 and has now lowered her price to $1,400,000, I'll make a new counteroffer that is higher than my previous one but still lower than Alice's current offer. This strategy aims to meet Alice halfway and find a mutually acceptable price. Considering the product's value to Alice is $1,200,000, I'll aim for a price that is closer to this value but still beneficial to me.
