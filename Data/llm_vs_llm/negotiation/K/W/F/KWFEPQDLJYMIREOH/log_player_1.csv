I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  Let's see if Bob is interested!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$100 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go that low. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm dropping the price a bit to $130. It's still above my minimum, and hopefully, it's a reasonable compromise for Bob."
