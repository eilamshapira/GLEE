Alice's offer is too high. We can definitely try to negotiate a better price.  We have plenty of rounds to work with before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

We'll start with a strong counteroffer, significantly below Alice's initial price but still giving room for negotiation. This lets Alice know we're serious about getting a good deal."
