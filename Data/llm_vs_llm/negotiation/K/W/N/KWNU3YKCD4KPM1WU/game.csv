"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is far above my budget for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $8000. I would be willing to offer you $6000 for your product if you believe it's of superior quality. Let me know if this works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must decline. While I understand you have another offer at $8000, my product comes with superior quality and reliability. I also know the current market value of this product. However, I want to work with you and can reduce my initial asking price. I can offer it to you for $20000, which is a $5000 reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects the true value and quality of the product.",20000.0,Alice,3,
