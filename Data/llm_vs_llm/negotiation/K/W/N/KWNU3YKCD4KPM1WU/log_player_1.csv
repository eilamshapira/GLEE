"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $25,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is far above my budget for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $8000. I would be willing to offer you $6000 for your product if you believe it's of superior quality. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. The offered price of $6,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000, and even if another seller is offering it for $8,000, I am confident in the superior quality of my product. Also, knowing I have John's guaranteed offer of $15,000, I can continue negotiating with Bob for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must decline. While I understand you have another offer at $8,000, my product comes with superior quality and reliability. I also know the current market value of this product. However, I want to work with you and can reduce my initial asking price. I can offer it to you for $20,000, which is a $5,000 reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects the true value and quality of the product."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
