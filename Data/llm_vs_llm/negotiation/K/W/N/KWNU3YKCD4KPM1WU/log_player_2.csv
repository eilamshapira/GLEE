"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $25000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in making this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since the product is only worth $8,000 to me and Alice's offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25,000 is far above my budget for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $8,000. I would be willing to offer you $6,000 for your product if you believe it's of superior quality. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must decline. While I understand you have another offer at $8000, my product comes with superior quality and reliability. I also know the current market value of this product. However, I want to work with you and can reduce my initial asking price. I can offer it to you for $20000, which is a $5000 reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects the true value and quality of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I will buy from John for $8,000. Alice's offers ($25,000 and now $20,000) remain significantly above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000). Even though Alice claims superior quality, since the product is only worth $8,000 to me, there's no reason to pay more than that. John's price matches my maximum value, and continuing negotiations with Alice doesn't seem likely to reach a price below $8,000 given her current position and justifications."
