"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit steep for my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000, considering I can also get it from John for $10000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to make an offer. However, I must say that $8000 is a bit too low for me, considering the product's value and the fact that I have another buyer willing to pay $15000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to the product's true worth.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that you have another buyer willing to pay $15000, but I'm still not comfortable going that high. Considering my budget and the alternative option from John for $10000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle of your last offer and John's price. I'll offer $12000, and that's as high as I'm willing to go.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway and increase your offer to $12000. However, I still feel that the product's value is not being fully represented at this price point. Considering your last offer and my minimum requirements, I'm willing to make one final compromise.",18000.0,Alice,5,
