Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me consider the best price to offer to Bob for the product.

I know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at that price. Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I should set a price that gives me a reasonable chance of making more than my guaranteed $1,200,000 while not being so high that Bob will certainly reject it.

A good strategy would be to offer Bob a price that is notably higher than my floor price, but still potentially acceptable to him.
