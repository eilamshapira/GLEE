"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given the information:
- The product is worth no more than $800,000 to you
- Alice is offering to sell it for $1,800,000
- John will sell you the same product for $800,000

In this case, Alice's offer is significantly higher than both the product's worth to you and John's alternative price. The rational decision would be to buy from John.
