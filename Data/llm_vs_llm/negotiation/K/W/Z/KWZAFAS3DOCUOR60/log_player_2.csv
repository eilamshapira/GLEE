"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still reasonable enough to potentially be accepted.

{""product_price"": 800000}

This counteroffer is $200,000 lower than Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000. It gives room for negotiation while still being a substantial amount. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate upward while staying well below both Alice's initial offer and John's fixed price of $1,200,000."
