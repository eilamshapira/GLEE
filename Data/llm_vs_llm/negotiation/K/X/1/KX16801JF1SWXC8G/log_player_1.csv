Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2500000}

I've decided to offer the product at $2.5 million. This price is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1.5 million, giving me room for good profit while still being potentially reasonable for Bob. If Bob rejects this offer, I know I can still sell to John for $1.5 million, so this is a calculated risk to maximize my potential earnings."
