"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Based on the information provided, the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me (Bob). Alice's offer is $2,500,000, which is significantly higher than the product's value to me. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for exactly $800,000.

Since Alice's offer ($2,500,000) is much higher than both the product's value to me and John's offer, the logical choice is to buy from John.
