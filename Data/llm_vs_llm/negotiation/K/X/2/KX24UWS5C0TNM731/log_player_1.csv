"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be beneficial for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and worth."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I was hoping to spend less. How about I offer you $6000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
# Explanation: I cannot accept $6,000 as it's well below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Since I have John's guaranteed offer of $10,000, I won't accept anything lower than that. However, I'll try one more counteroffer to Bob before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is significantly below the product's value. I need to maintain a minimum price of $10,000 for this product, as that reflects its true market value. Given that you're interested, I can offer it to you for $10,500, which is much closer to my minimum price point."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still looking to spend less. Would you consider selling the product for $7000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
# Explanation: Bob's new offer of $7,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Since we seem to be far apart in our price expectations and I know the product is only worth $8,000 to Bob, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal above $10,000. Therefore, it makes the most economic sense to sell to John for the guaranteed $10,000 rather than continue negotiations."
