Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6000 is significantly below the product's value.

Given that you're interested, I can offer it to you for $10500, which is much closer to my minimum price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
