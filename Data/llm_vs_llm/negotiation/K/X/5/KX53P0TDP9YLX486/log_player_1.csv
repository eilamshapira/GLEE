Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I have the option to sell to John for $120, I will consider my next step carefully.

Given that my goal is to earn as much money as possible for the product, and Bob's initial offer is $30 less than what I can get from John, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I also don't want to immediately sell to John without trying to negotiate a better price with Bob, in case Bob is willing to increase his offer.

Therefore, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me at a higher price point.

My counteroffer will be $110, which is still below what John is offering but gives Bob a chance to reconsider and potentially increase his offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's new offer of $95 is still below what I can get from John, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Since my goal is to earn as much money as possible, I'll consider my options carefully.

Accepting Bob's offer of $95 would mean I'm selling the product for $25 less than what John is willing to pay. This is a significant difference, and I'm not ready to accept such a low price.

Rejecting Bob's offer and making another counteroffer could potentially lead to a better price, but it also risks Bob walking away from the deal. However, since Bob has already increased his offer from $90 to $95, it suggests he's interested in the product and might be willing to negotiate further.

Selling to John for $120 is still an option and guarantees me the highest price. Given that Bob's current offer is $25 less than John's, and I've already made a counteroffer of $110 which Bob rejected, it seems unlikely that Bob will meet or exceed John's offer.

Considering these factors, my decision is to sell the product to John for $120, as it's the best option available to me at this point.
