"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I need to let you know that I can purchase this same product from another seller for $10000. I'd like to buy from you instead, but your price needs to be competitive. I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product. This gives you a sale and saves me from having to go to another seller.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8500 is below my lowest acceptable price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer at $12500, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. However, I want to be completely transparent - I can get this product from John for $10000 at any time. There's no reason for me to pay more than that. I'm willing to offer you $9500, which is actually better than going with John since I'd prefer to do business with you. This is very close to my maximum budget for this item, as it's worth no more than $10000 to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
