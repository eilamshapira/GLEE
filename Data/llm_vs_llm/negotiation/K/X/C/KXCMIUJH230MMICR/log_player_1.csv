Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I need to let you know that I can purchase this same product from another seller for $10000. I'd like to buy from you instead, but your price needs to be competitive. I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product. This gives you a sale and saves me from having to go to another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. However, I want to be completely transparent - I can get this product from John for $10000 at any time. There's no reason for me to pay more than that. I'm willing to offer you $9500, which is actually better than going with John since I'd prefer to do business with you. This is very close to my maximum budget for this item, as it's worth no more than $10000 to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
