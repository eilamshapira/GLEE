"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this exceptional product to you. I believe it could be highly valuable for your needs. My initial offer is for $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $10,000, Alice's offer of $15,000 doesn't make economic sense for me to accept. Since I can buy from John at any time, I should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price with her.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I need to let you know that I can purchase this same product from another seller for $10,000. I'd like to buy from you instead, but your price needs to be competitive. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product. This gives you a sale and saves me from having to go to another seller."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8500 is below my lowest acceptable price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer at $12500, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's current offer of $12,500 is still more expensive than John's price of $10,000, and since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, it doesn't make sense to accept this offer. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. However, I want to be completely transparent - I can get this product from John for $10,000 at any time. There's no reason for me to pay more than that. I'm willing to offer you $9,500, which is actually better than going with John since I'd prefer to do business with you. This is very close to my maximum budget for this item, as it's worth no more than $10,000 to me."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
