"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I certainly understand Bob's perspective, but I believe the product's value is higher.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 9000}

Bob, I understand that you see the product's value at $6,500, but I believe it's worth more. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $9,000. This way, we both get a good deal."
