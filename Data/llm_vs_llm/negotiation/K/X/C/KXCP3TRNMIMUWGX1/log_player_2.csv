"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The offer from Alice is $10,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product (worth no more than $8,000 to me). Since John is offering the product for $8,000, which is at my maximum valuation, I should either try to negotiate with Alice for a better price or go with John's offer.

Since Alice's initial offer doesn't save me any money compared to John's offer (and actually costs me more), the best decision is to either reject and make a counteroffer or buy from John directly. Given that Alice values the product at $10,000, there may be room for negotiation, but John's offer is already at my maximum valuation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice at a price that gives me a better deal than John's $8,000 offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price from $10,000 to $9,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this price is still higher than John's offer of $8,000. Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, paying $9,000 would mean I'm losing value.

John's offer of $8,000 matches my maximum valuation for the product. Alice would need to offer below $8,000 for her deal to be better than John's.
