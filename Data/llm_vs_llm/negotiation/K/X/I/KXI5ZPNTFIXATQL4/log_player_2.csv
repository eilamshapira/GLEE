"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $15,000
2. Alice's offer is $14,999
3. John's price is $15,000
4. If I reject Alice's offer, I can only buy from John at $15,000

Alice's offer is only $1 less than my maximum valuation and John's price. While I would save $1 by accepting Alice's offer compared to buying from John, this offer is very close to my maximum value. However, since I need the product and Alice's price is technically lower than John's, I should accept Alice's offer to save that $1.
