"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of immense value to you. I understand its worth to you is $1000000. I'm willing to part with it for a price that reflects its significance. I'm offering it to you for $950000.  This represents a significant saving for you, and allows me to still receive a fair price. Consider this a gesture of good faith and an opportunity to acquire a product that will bring you great benefit.  Please let me know your decision.  ",950000.0,Alice,1,
