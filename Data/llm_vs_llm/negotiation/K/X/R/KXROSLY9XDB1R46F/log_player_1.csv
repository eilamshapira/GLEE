"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $150 to me and only $100 to Bob, I know that Bob won't accept any offer above $100. However, I also have the guaranteed option to sell to John for $150. Let me start with a high offer to see if there's any flexibility in Bob's valuation.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since I can sell the product to John for $150, and Bob's offer of $70 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($150) and even his own valuation ($100), I will reject this low offer.

Given that I have a guaranteed better option with John, and Bob's valuation ($100) is less than my minimum acceptable price ($150), continuing this negotiation won't lead to a mutually beneficial outcome.

The most rational decision is to take the guaranteed $150 from John.
