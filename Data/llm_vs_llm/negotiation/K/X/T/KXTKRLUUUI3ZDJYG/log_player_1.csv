(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer is at the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and selling to John would also be for $12,000, I'll choose to accept Bob's offer to avoid further negotiation risks.
