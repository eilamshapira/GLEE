"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2300000. I believe this is reflective of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $2300000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to consider a price closer to $800000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $800000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1900000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1900000 is still outside my price range. I'm ready to offer $1200000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my seriousness in acquiring it.  I hope we can reach an agreement soon.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1200000 is closer, but still undervalues what this product brings to the table. I'm willing to consider $1600000. This is a tight margin for me, but I believe in finding common ground with serious buyers.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for continuing to work with me. $1600000 is a significant step in the right direction, but it's still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1400000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both of our interests.  Let's close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
