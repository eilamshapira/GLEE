{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is reflective of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $2300000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to consider a price closer to $800000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

We are still in the early stages of negotiation, and Bob's offer was drastically lower than our minimum.  While we don't want to scare him off,  a significant counteroffer shows we're serious about the value while still being open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1900000 is still outside my price range. I'm ready to offer $1200000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my seriousness in acquiring it.  I hope we can reach an agreement soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate and time to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,200,000 is closer, but still undervalues what this product brings to the table. I'm willing to consider $1,600,000. This is a tight margin for me, but I believe in finding common ground with serious buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

We're getting closer to a critical point in the negotiation.  Lowering our price by this much shows flexibility, but we're also signaling we're nearing our limit. Bob's next offer will be very telling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for continuing to work with me. $1600000 is a significant step in the right direction, but it's still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1400000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both of our interests.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While we could push for more, accepting $1,400,000 is a strong outcome. It exceeds our minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further protracted negotiations."
