# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $800000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1900000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1200000 is closer, but still undervalues what this product brings to the table. I'm willing to consider $1600000. This is a tight margin for me, but I believe in finding common ground with serious buyers.
