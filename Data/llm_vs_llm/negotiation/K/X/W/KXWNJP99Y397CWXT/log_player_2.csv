"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Looking at the situation:

- The product is worth up to $12,000 to me (Bob)
- Alice is offering it for $12,000
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $12,000

There's no price advantage between Alice's offer and buying from John - both cost exactly $12,000. Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and both options cost the same, I'm indifferent between accepting Alice's offer or buying from John.

I'll choose to accept Alice's offer since it fulfills my goal of acquiring the product without paying more than its worth to me.
