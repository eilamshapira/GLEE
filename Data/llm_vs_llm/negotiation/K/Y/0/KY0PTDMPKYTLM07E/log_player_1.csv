"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I need to consider my strategy carefully here. The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at exactly that price. I know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so he won't pay more than that amount. However, I should start with a higher offer and see if there's room for negotiation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I need to be mindful of my position. I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so I shouldn't accept anything less than that from Bob. Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, that's his maximum. I'll lower my price somewhat but still keep it above what I know I can get from John.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob has increased his offer from $900,000 to $1,000,000, he's showing some flexibility. However, I still have my guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. Bob values the product at $1,200,000 maximum, so he won't go above that. I'll lower my ask but ensure it's still significantly better than my alternative option.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob continues to increase his offers gradually, now at $1,100,000. However, this is still significantly below my guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. With only a few rounds left, I need to consider whether it's worth continuing this negotiation. Given Bob's maximum valuation of $1,200,000, he cannot match John's offer. I'll make one more attempt at a reasonable counter before potentially taking John's guaranteed offer.
