"Hello Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1500000 is higher than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is more in the range of $1000000. Would you consider that?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is significantly below my desired price, I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm prepared to accept $1250000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it offers.  Let me know if you're interested.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $1150000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go down to $1200000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, as it's already close to my minimum acceptable price. Let me know if you're ready to close the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
