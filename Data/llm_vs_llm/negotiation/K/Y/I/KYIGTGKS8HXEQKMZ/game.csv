"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to consider that?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in the product, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I can offer you a discount from the original price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $220. Would you be willing to consider that?",220.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the discount, Alice, but $220 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your new price. How about $170? I think that's a fair price for the product.",170.0,Bob,4,
