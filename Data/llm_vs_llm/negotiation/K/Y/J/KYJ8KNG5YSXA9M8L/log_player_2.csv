"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $2,000,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within my budget, but I'd like to try to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I know the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, I'll make a counteroffer that is halfway between $0 and $1,000,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's new offer is $1,500,000, which is still above my budget of $1,000,000, I will reject it. Additionally, I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is a better deal for me.

However, I'd like to try to negotiate with Alice a bit more to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. So, I'll reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's previous offer was $1,500,000, and I previously offered $500,000, I'll try to meet her halfway. However, I'll also keep in mind that I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, so I won't go above that price.

I'll make a counteroffer of $750,000, which is still below my maximum budget and below Alice's previous offer.

{""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's new offer is $1,200,000, which is still above my budget of $1,000,000, I will reject it. At this point, I think it's clear that Alice is not willing to sell the product to me at a price that I'm comfortable with.

Given that I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is a better deal for me, I think it's time to stop negotiating with Alice and take the better offer.
