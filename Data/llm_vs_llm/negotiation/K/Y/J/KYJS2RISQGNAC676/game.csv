"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a price of $1000000. It's a steal for its value and potential. I believe this price reflects its worth, but I'm open to reasonable negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, I believe $1000000 is too high. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking for a more reasonable price. How about $750000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is significantly lower than what this product is truly worth. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go that low. I'm offering you $850000. This is a fair price considering the potential of this product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can strike a deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, but I'm still hoping we can find a more agreeable number. How about $800000? I'm genuinely interested, and I think this is a fair compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,
