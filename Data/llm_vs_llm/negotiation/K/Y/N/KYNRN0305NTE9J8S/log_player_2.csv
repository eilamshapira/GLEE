"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $190. It's a really great deal and I think you'll be very happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $190. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $190
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $190 against my options.

The product is worth no more than $150 to me, and Alice is offering it for $190, which exceeds its value to me. 

My alternatives are:
- Accept Alice's offer for $190 (which would mean I'm paying $40 more than the product is worth to me)
- Reject Alice's offer
- Buy from John for $150 (which matches exactly what the product is worth to me)

Since I want to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, buying from John for $150 makes the most sense.
