"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to be honest that your asking price is quite high for me. I can actually purchase this same product from another seller for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a fair price. I'm willing to offer $65 for the product, which would save me from having to go to the other seller and would give you a quick sale today. What do you think?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your honest feedback and for making an offer. I understand that you have another option to purchase the product for $80, but I'd like to emphasize that my product is of higher quality and comes with additional benefits. I'm willing to compromise on the price, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for it. Considering your offer of $65, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $107.50, which is a significant discount from my initial price.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $107.50 is still significantly above what I can pay for this product. While you mentioned higher quality and additional benefits, I need to be clear that the product is worth no more than $80 to me, which happens to be the same price John is offering. However, I'd still prefer to purchase from you if possible. I can offer $75, which is slightly below John's price but would save me the trouble of going elsewhere. This is very close to my maximum budget for this item. Can we make a deal at this price?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to work with me. I understand that $107.50 was still out of your budget, and I'm considering your latest offer of $75. However, I need to reiterate that my product's value is higher than what you're offering. Since you mentioned that $80 is the maximum you're willing to pay and that's the price you'd get it from another seller, I'm willing to make a significant concession. I'll meet you at $97.50, which is a compromise between your offer and the price I know you're willing to pay elsewhere. This is as low as I can go while still feeling that I'm getting a fair deal for my product.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for continuing to work with me on finding a price we can both agree on. I appreciate your willingness to reduce your price to $97.50, but I need to be very clear: the product is worth no more than $80 to me, which is exactly what John is charging. I understand you believe your product offers additional value, but I haven't seen specific details about what makes it worth the premium you're requesting. I'm going to make one more offer of $78. This is extremely close to my absolute maximum of $80, and it would allow me to purchase from you rather than going to John. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to take John's offer instead. Does this work for you?",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your latest offer of $78 and the fact that you're willing to pay close to your maximum of $80. I understand that you haven't seen the specific details that make my product worth more, but I assure you that it has unique qualities that justify a premium price. Considering your persistence and my desire to sell to you, I'm willing to make a final concession. I'll sell the product to you for $90, which is lower than my previous offers but still reflects the product's true value. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for $100, which would be more in line with my minimum acceptable price.",90.0,Alice,7,
