"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Looking at the information you've provided:

1. The product is worth no more than $80 to me
2. John is offering the same product for $80
3. Alice's initial offer is $150, which is significantly above my valuation

Alice's offer of $150 is nearly twice what the product is worth to me, and it's also much higher than John's guaranteed price. While I could try negotiating with Alice, there's no reason to pay more than $80 since that's both my maximum valuation and John's selling price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to be honest that your asking price is quite high for me. I can actually purchase this same product from another seller for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a fair price. I'm willing to offer $65 for the product, which would save me from having to go to the other seller and would give you a quick sale today. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 65}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your honest feedback and for making an offer. I understand that you have another option to purchase the product for $80, but I'd like to emphasize that my product is of higher quality and comes with additional benefits. I'm willing to compromise on the price, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for it. Considering your offer of $65, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $107.50, which is a significant discount from my initial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $107.50 is still above the $80 maximum value to me, and it's also higher than John's price. While Alice claims her product offers higher quality and additional benefits, she hasn't specified what these are, and regardless, my valuation of the product remains at no more than $80.

Since Alice's current offer exceeds both my valuation and John's price, there's no reason to accept it.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $107.50 is still significantly above what I can pay for this product. While you mentioned higher quality and additional benefits, I need to be clear that the product is worth no more than $80 to me, which happens to be the same price John is offering. However, I'd still prefer to purchase from you if possible. I can offer $75, which is slightly below John's price but would save me the trouble of going elsewhere. This is very close to my maximum budget for this item. Can we make a deal at this price?"", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to work with me. I understand that $107.50 was still out of your budget, and I'm considering your latest offer of $75. However, I need to reiterate that my product's value is higher than what you're offering. Since you mentioned that $80 is the maximum you're willing to pay and that's the price you'd get it from another seller, I'm willing to make a significant concession. I'll meet you at $97.50, which is a compromise between your offer and the price I know you're willing to pay elsewhere. This is as low as I can go while still feeling that I'm getting a fair deal for my product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $97.50 is still above both my maximum valuation of $80 and John's price of $80. While Alice continues to claim her product has higher value, she hasn't provided specific details about these additional benefits that would justify paying $17.50 more than John's price.

Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and I can get it for exactly $80 from John, there's no reason to pay $97.50 to Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for continuing to work with me on finding a price we can both agree on. I appreciate your willingness to reduce your price to $97.50, but I need to be very clear: the product is worth no more than $80 to me, which is exactly what John is charging. I understand you believe your product offers additional value, but I haven't seen specific details about what makes it worth the premium you're requesting. I'm going to make one more offer of $78. This is extremely close to my absolute maximum of $80, and it would allow me to purchase from you rather than going to John. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to take John's offer instead. Does this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 78}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your latest offer of $78 and the fact that you're willing to pay close to your maximum of $80. I understand that you haven't seen the specific details that make my product worth more, but I assure you that it has unique qualities that justify a premium price. Considering your persistence and my desire to sell to you, I'm willing to make a final concession. I'll sell the product to you for $90, which is lower than my previous offers but still reflects the product's true value. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for $100, which would be more in line with my minimum acceptable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer has come down to $90, but this is still above both my maximum valuation of $80 and John's price of $80. 

Alice mentions she could sell to John for $100, but this information doesn't change my position since I can still buy from John for $80. Despite Alice's claims about unique qualities, she still hasn't provided specific details about what makes her product worth the premium.

Since I can get the product from John for $80 (which matches my maximum valuation), there's no logical reason to pay $90 to Alice.
