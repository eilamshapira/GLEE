"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $140. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this decision. 

I'm looking for a product that's worth no more than $150 to me. I have two options now:
1. Buy from Alice for $140
2. Buy from John for $150

The product is the same, so I should go with the cheaper option. Alice is offering $140, which is $10 less than John's price of $150.

Even though the product is worth $120 to Alice (meaning she's making a $20 profit), that doesn't change the fact that her offer is better than my alternative.
