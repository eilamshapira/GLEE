"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be a good deal closer to $6000. Would you consider an offer in that range?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that my initial price may have been a bit steep, but I believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. However, I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'm reducing the price, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's meet in the middle.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10000 is still more than I'm willing to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $7000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
