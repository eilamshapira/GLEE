Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its worth."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be a good deal closer to $6000. Would you consider an offer in that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is below my minimum threshold of $8,000, and I have the option to sell it to John for $8,000, I will consider my next steps carefully.

Given that Bob's offer is $2,000 less than what I can get from John, and I'm aiming to earn as much as I can, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. However, I need to be strategic about my counteroffer to keep Bob interested.

My decision for now is to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer that is closer to my initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that my initial price may have been a bit steep, but I believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. However, I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'm reducing the price, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10000 is still more than I'm willing to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $7000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's new offer of $7,000 is still below what I can get from John, which is $8,000. Since my goal is to earn as much money as I can for the product, I need to weigh my options carefully.

Accepting Bob's offer of $7,000 would mean I'm selling the product for $1,000 less than I can get from John. Given that I've already negotiated down from my initial offer, I'm not inclined to go lower than what I know I can get from another buyer.

Rejecting Bob's offer and making another counteroffer could potentially lead to further negotiations, but it also risks Bob walking away from the deal altogether.

Considering these factors, the most lucrative option for me at this point is to sell the product to John for $8,000, as it meets my minimum threshold and ensures I get the best price currently available.
