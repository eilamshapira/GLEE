Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that my initial price may have been a bit steep, but I believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. However, I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'm reducing the price, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

While Alice is negotiating, the price is still too high. I'll counteroffer again, moving closer to a more reasonable middle ground."
