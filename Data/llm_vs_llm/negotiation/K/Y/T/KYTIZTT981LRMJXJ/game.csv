"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, but I'm afraid $5000000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, considering the product's worth. I'd like to propose a price that I believe is more reasonable.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $750000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the product's value is significantly higher. I'm willing to compromise and make a counteroffer. I'd like to propose a price of $3000000, which I think is more reflective of the product's worth. I'm open to further negotiations, but I hope we can meet closer to this price.",3000000.0,Alice,3,
