Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, but I'm afraid $5000000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, considering the product's worth. I'd like to propose a price that I believe is more reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $750,000 is lower than my initial offer and I believe the product is worth more. I'll try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. 

My counteroffer: $3,000,000"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your counteroffer of $3000000. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still believe the price is higher than I'm willing to pay. Considering the product's value and our previous discussions, I'd like to propose a price that I think is more reasonable and closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and it's also higher than the price I would get from selling to John. Since Bob has been willing to negotiate and increase his offer, I believe $1,200,000 is a reasonable price for the product. I'll accept his offer and sell the product to him."
