"Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1400000 is a serious offer, I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. I believe this price better reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to consider further negotiations.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Okay Alice, the product sounds promising, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1600000?",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to make a concession and offer it to you for $1750000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with at this point, but I'm open to further discussion.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
