Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Considering my minimum value for the product is $120, I must reject Bob's offer of $100. I also prefer selling for $120 to John over selling for $100 to Bob.

Therefore, my decision is:

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","This is a tough one. $150 is better than my minimum of $120 and better than selling to John. I could potentially get more from Bob, but I could also lose the sale entirely. Given that I've already had two rounds, I'm a little less confident in getting a significantly better offer.

Therefore, I will accept Bob's offer.
