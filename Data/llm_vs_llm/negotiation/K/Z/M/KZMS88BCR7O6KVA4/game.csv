"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm initially offering it for $25000.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $25000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $5000.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While $5000 is too low for me, I am willing to negotiate. How about $22000?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $22000 is still considerably outside my price range. I could go up to $7500, but that's the absolute highest I can justify.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I also have a bottom line. Let's try to meet in the middle a bit more. How about $19000?",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, $19000 is still a substantial stretch for me.  I can offer $9000, and that's pushing my absolute limit. I do need to consider other options if we can't agree on a price closer to this.",9000.0,Bob,6,
