Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 12000}

Rationale: Since I know I can sell the product to John for $12,000 (which matches my minimum acceptable price), and I know the product is only worth $8,000 to Bob, there's no reason to offer a lower price. If Bob rejects my offer (which he likely will since it's above his valuation), I can still sell to John at $12,000. This maximizes my earnings while ensuring I don't sell below my minimum acceptable price."
