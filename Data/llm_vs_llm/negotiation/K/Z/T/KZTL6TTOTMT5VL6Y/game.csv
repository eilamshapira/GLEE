"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $80 is below our minimum price. I can go down to $130. Let me know if this works for you.",130.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 was a bit high for you. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer the product for $125. Let me know what you think!",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $125, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Could you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still below our minimum. I can offer the product at $122, which is the lowest I can go. Let me know if this works for you.",122.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. I can lower the price to $121, which is really the best I can do. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",121.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your effort to lower the price, but $121 is still above what I'm willing to spend. How about we settle at $95?",95.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still below our minimum. I can offer the product at $120, which is the absolute lowest I can go. Let me know if this works for you.",120.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're close, but I really can't go any lower than $120. This is my final offer. Let me know if you can accept this price.",120.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand $120 is your final offer, but it's still beyond my budget. Could we possibly meet at $100? That's the highest I can go.",100.0,Bob,8,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is below our minimum price. I will have to sell the product to another buyer. Thank you for your interest!",,Alice,8,SellToJhon
