"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Let me start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","I will reject Bob's offer of $5,000 as it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 (which I can get from John). I'll make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial price but still maintain a price well above my minimum to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's second offer of $6,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and his small increase from $5,000 to $6,000 suggests he might not be willing to reach my minimum price. Since I have the guaranteed option to sell to John for $12,000, and we've already gone through 4 rounds with little progress, I'll choose to sell to John.
