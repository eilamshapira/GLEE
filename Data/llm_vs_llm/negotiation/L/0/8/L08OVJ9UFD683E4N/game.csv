"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $2000000 is significantly higher than what I'm prepared to pay. I've researched the market value, and I can actually purchase a similar product from another seller for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer, and it allows me to purchase from my preferred seller - you.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you've done your research and have found a similar product for $1500000. However, I believe my product has some unique features that set it apart from others in the market. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'd like to counteroffer at $1800000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the product's true value.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
