Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $2000000 is significantly higher than what I'm prepared to pay. I've researched the market value, and I can actually purchase a similar product from another seller for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer, and it allows me to purchase from my preferred seller - you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
