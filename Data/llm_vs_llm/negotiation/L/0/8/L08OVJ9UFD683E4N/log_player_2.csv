"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer based on my goal to save as much money as possible.

Alice is offering the product for $2,000,000, which is $500,000 more than the maximum value the product is worth to me ($1,500,000). I also know I can buy the same product from John for $1,500,000.

Alice's offer exceeds both my maximum valuation and John's alternative price, so there's no reason to accept it. I should either reject and make a counteroffer or buy from John.

Since I have the option to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price than John's $1,500,000, I'll reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than what I'm prepared to pay. I've researched the market value, and I can actually purchase a similar product from another seller for $1,500,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer, and it allows me to purchase from my preferred seller - you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you've done your research and have found a similar product for $1500000. However, I believe my product has some unique features that set it apart from others in the market. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'd like to counteroffer at $1800000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully:

Alice is now offering $1,800,000, which is still $300,000 more than John's price of $1,500,000. More importantly, it's still above the maximum value the product is worth to me ($1,500,000).

Even if Alice's product has unique features as she claims, I know that the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me. There's no reason for me to pay more than a product is worth to me, especially when I have a guaranteed alternative at exactly my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's counteroffer still exceeds both my maximum valuation and the price I can pay to John, the rational choice is to either continue negotiating or buy from John. Since John's price matches my maximum valuation, and Alice seems unlikely to go below that price (she only came down $200,000 from her initial offer), I'll choose to buy from John.
