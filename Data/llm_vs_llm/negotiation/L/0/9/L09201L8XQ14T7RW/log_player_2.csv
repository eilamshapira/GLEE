"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $14,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's offer of $8,000, the rational decision would be to buy from John.
