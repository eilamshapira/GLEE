"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $15000. If we can agree on that price, I'd be happy to move forward.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $15000 is actually my absolute minimum price point, as I have another buyer ready at that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you. Given the product's quality and market value, I can reduce my price to $22000. This is significantly below market value and represents a great investment opportunity for you.",22000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $22000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $18000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. I'm hoping we can find a compromise.",18000.0,Bob,4,
