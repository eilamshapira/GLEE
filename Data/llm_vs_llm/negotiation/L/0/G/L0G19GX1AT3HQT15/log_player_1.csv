Send your offer to Bob.,"Based on the situation, I need to make a strategic decision about the price to offer Bob.

The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, and I have a fallback option of selling to John for $1,000,000.

Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, he would rationally accept any price up to that amount. However, the closer I get to $1,500,000, the more likely he is to reject the offer.

I should offer a price that gives Bob some incentive to accept while maximizing my profit above my $1,000,000 minimum. A reasonable approach would be to split the surplus value ($500,000) somewhat in my favor.
