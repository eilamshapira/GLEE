"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $18,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum valuation of $10,000. It doesn't make sense for me to accept this offer since it would result in a negative value for me.

I also have the option to buy from John for $10,000, which is exactly my maximum valuation. However, before committing to that, I should try negotiating with Alice first to see if I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and Alice's initial offer was $18,000, I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives room for negotiation but still represents good value for me.

{""product_price"": $8,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her offer from $18,000 to $16,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this price is still significantly above my maximum valuation of $10,000. It doesn't make economic sense for me to accept a price that's $6,000 above my valuation.

I already know John will sell me the product for $10,000, which is at my maximum valuation. However, I'll try one more round of negotiation with Alice before considering John's option.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer somewhat to show I'm negotiating in good faith, but I need to keep it well below my maximum valuation of $10,000 to maintain room for further negotiation.

{""product_price"": $9,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has only reduced her offer by $500 to $15,500, which is still $5,500 above my maximum valuation of $10,000. At this rate of negotiation, it's unlikely we'll reach a price below my maximum valuation.

Since we're now in Round 5 (halfway through our potential 10 rounds), and Alice is still offering a price significantly above what I can accept, it makes more economic sense to take John's offer.
