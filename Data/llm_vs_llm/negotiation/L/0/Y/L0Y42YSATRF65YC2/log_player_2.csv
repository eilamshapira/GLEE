You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is the same price John is selling it for. Since you are trying to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer makes sense. You can then purchase the product from John for the same price, achieving your goal of saving money."
