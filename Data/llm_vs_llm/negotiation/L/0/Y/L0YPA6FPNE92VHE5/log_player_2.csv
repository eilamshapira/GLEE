"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $80 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $150
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $80

Alice's offer ($150) is significantly higher than both:
- The value I place on the product ($80)
- John's alternative offer ($80)

It makes no economic sense to accept Alice's offer of $150 when I can get the same product from John for $80, which matches my maximum valuation. Therefore, I should buy from John.
