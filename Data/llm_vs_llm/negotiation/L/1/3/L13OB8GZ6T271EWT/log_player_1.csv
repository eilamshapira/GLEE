Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000 (which I can get from John), and it's also below what I believe the product is worth, I will reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let me make a counteroffer that's lower than my initial offer but still higher than John's guaranteed price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1,600,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is significantly better than John's guaranteed $1,200,000, and it's a reasonable improvement from his previous offer. Since there's always a risk that Bob might walk away if I push too hard, and this offer gives me a good profit margin above my minimum price, I'll accept it.
