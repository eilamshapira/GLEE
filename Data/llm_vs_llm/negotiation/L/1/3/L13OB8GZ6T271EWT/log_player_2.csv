"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,500,000, it would be unwise to accept it. Additionally, buying from John for $1,500,000 is an option, but I'd like to try and negotiate a better price with Alice first. Therefore, the best course of action is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of reaching a mutually agreeable price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range, considering my maximum budget is $1,500,000. A good starting point could be around $1,000,000, which gives room for negotiation while also being serious about purchasing the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,600,000 is closer to my budget but still exceeds it. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,500,000, which is within my budget and actually cheaper than Alice's current offer, I should consider this as a viable alternative. However, I'm interested in seeing if Alice can offer a better deal, so I'll reject her current offer and make another counteroffer, trying to bring the price down closer to or below $1,500,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice's last offer was $1,600,000 and I'm trying to bring the price down to or below $1,500,000, my next counteroffer should be strategic. I'll offer a price that's slightly above the $1,500,000 I'm willing to pay, to give Alice some room to negotiate while also being mindful of my budget constraint. Offering $1,450,000 could be a good compromise, as it shows I'm serious about buying the product while also trying to save as much money as possible.
