"Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I understand that the product has unique features and market value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe this price reflects a fair value for the product, considering my budget and the potential benefits it could bring to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must inform you that I have another buyer willing to pay $1000000 for this product. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation with you. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1050000, which is much closer to the market value. This is still a fair price considering the product's worth, and it's only slightly above what my other buyer is offering.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and reduce the price. However, $1050000 is still above my budget. Considering the other buyer's offer of $1000000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'd like to propose a price of $750000. This price takes into account the product's value and my own financial constraints.",750000.0,Bob,4,
