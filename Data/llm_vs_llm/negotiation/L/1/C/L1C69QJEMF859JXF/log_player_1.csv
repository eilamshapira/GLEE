"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be beneficial for you. Given its unique features and market value, I'm offering it at $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential value."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I understand that the product has unique features and market value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe this price reflects a fair value for the product, considering my budget and the potential benefits it could bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
I'll make a counteroffer to Bob as $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Since I know I can sell to John for $1,000,000, I want to give Bob another chance but with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must inform you that I have another buyer willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation with you. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1,050,000, which is much closer to the market value. This is still a fair price considering the product's worth, and it's only slightly above what my other buyer is offering."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and reduce the price. However, $1050000 is still above my budget. Considering the other buyer's offer of $1000000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'd like to propose a price of $750000. This price takes into account the product's value and my own financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
I will sell to John. Bob's offer of $750,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and since I know I can get $1,000,000 from John, it doesn't make sense to continue negotiating for a lower amount. This ensures I get my minimum desired price and don't risk further rounds of negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome."
