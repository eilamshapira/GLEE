{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice. $95 is too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

We'll start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation while still potentially securing a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're making progress, but $85 is still a bit high. Let's see if we can meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

We'll inch up our offer slightly to show we're willing to compromise, but $75 remains a fair price point."
