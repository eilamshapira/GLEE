"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to be careful here. Alice is offering the product for $900,000, but the product is only worth $800,000 to me. If I bought at Alice's current price, I would be losing $100,000 in value. 

Since I know I can always get the product from John for $800,000 (which matches exactly what the product is worth to me), I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. This gives me a chance to get the product for less than $800,000, which would create value for me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly below John's price to give myself room to negotiate upward if needed.

{""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her offer from $900,000 to $875,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still $75,000 more than John's price of $800,000. Since the product is worth $800,000 to me, I would be overpaying if I accepted Alice's current offer.

Given that I can always buy from John at $800,000, and we still have several rounds of negotiation left, I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still aim to get a price below John's $800,000 option.

{""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her offer again to $850,000, which continues to show she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still $50,000 more than John's price of $800,000. Since the product is worth exactly $800,000 to me, I would still be overpaying if I accepted Alice's current offer.

Given that I can always buy from John at $800,000, and we still have several rounds left for negotiation, I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll continue increasing my offer to show good faith in the negotiation, but still aim to get a better price than John's offer.

{""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $825,000, continuing to move closer to my target price. However, this is still $25,000 more than John's price of $800,000. Since the product is worth exactly $800,000 to me, accepting Alice's current offer would mean I'm still losing $25,000 in value.

Given that I can buy from John at exactly $800,000 (which equals the product's worth to me), and we're now in round 7 (with 10 rounds total), I need to make a decision. I'll reject Alice's offer one more time to see if she'll come down further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make one more attempt to get a price below John's offer, but I'll move closer to the $800,000 mark to show I'm serious about closing the deal.

{""product_price"": 775000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has now reduced her offer to $810,000, which is very close to John's price of $800,000. However, it's still $10,000 more than what I can get from John, and since the product is worth exactly $800,000 to me, I would still be losing $10,000 in value if I accepted.

We're now at round 9 of 10, so we only have one more round after this. Since Alice has been consistently dropping her price, and we're getting very close to my target, I'll reject one more time to see if she'll meet or beat John's price in the final round.

If not, I can always choose to buy from John in the final round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since this is the final round and my last chance to make a deal with Alice, I'll make an offer that's slightly below John's price but still reasonable based on our negotiation progress.
