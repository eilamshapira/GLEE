,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential value.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $800000 is lower than my initial asking price, it doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a significant reduction, but I believe it's fair considering your interest.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $1250000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think the price is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a reasonable price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your current price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and your desire to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  I'm offering $1075000.  This is a substantial reduction from my last offer, demonstrating my commitment to finding a solution. Let's finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate and meet me halfway. Your new offer of $1075000 is closer to my target price, but I'm still a bit short. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the concessions you've already made, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting close to my lower limit, but I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'm offering $1000000.  This price reflects the value of the product, while acknowledging your financial constraints.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
