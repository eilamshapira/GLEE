Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product that I believe you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?,200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $100 is too low for me. How about I sell it to you for $175? Let me know if that works for you!",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down from $200 to $175, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your new offer. How about we settle on $137.50?",137.5,Bob,4,
