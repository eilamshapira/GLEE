"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $20000. This product has excellent features and durability that make it worth the investment. Let me know if you're interested.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is significantly above my budget. I can find similar products in the market for much less. I value this product at no more than $8000, and I have another seller offering it at that price. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. Would you consider selling it for $6000? This would give us both a fair deal.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand budget considerations. However, $6000 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. This product has superior quality and features compared to similar options on the market. While I can't meet your $6000 offer, I'm willing to come down to $16000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of what you're getting. If the gap between our positions is too large, please understand I have other interested buyers at higher price points.",16000.0,Alice,3,
