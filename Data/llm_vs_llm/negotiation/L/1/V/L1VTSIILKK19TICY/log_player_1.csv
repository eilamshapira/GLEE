Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is significantly above my budget. I can find similar products in the market for much less. I value this product at no more than $8000, and I have another seller offering it at that price. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. Would you consider selling it for $6000? This would give us both a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand budget considerations. However, $6,000 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. This product has superior quality and features compared to similar options on the market. While I can't meet your $6,000 offer, I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of what you're getting. If the gap between our positions is too large, please understand I have other interested buyers at higher price points."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
