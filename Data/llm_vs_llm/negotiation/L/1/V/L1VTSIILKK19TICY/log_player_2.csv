"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $20000. This product has excellent features and durability that make it worth the investment. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $20,000 is way above my maximum value of $8,000, and it's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $8,000. There's no reason to accept this offer when I can either try to negotiate for a better price or buy from John. I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20,000 is significantly above my budget. I can find similar products in the market for much less. I value this product at no more than $8,000, and I have another seller offering it at that price. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. Would you consider selling it for $6,000? This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand budget considerations. However, $6000 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. This product has superior quality and features compared to similar options on the market. While I can't meet your $6000 offer, I'm willing to come down to $16000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of what you're getting. If the gap between our positions is too large, please understand I have other interested buyers at higher price points. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's new offer of $16,000 is still significantly above my maximum value of $8,000, and she seems unwilling to come down to a price near my range (as evidenced by her statement about having other interested buyers at higher price points), it makes the most sense to buy from John at $8,000. This is exactly at my maximum value and is clearly much better than Alice's current offer. Continuing negotiations with Alice seems unlikely to result in a price that would beat John's offer."
