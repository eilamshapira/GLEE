"Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you today. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in your product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $90? Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $90 is a bit low considering the product's value, I can come down from my initial price. Would you consider $105? This is a fair price for the quality you're getting.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a little out of my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
