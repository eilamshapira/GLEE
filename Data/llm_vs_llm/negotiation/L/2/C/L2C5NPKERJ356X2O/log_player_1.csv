"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you today. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in your product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $90? Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $90 is too close to my minimum price of $80, and since Bob is willing to negotiate, I believe we can find a middle ground that's more favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $90 is a bit low considering the product's value, I can come down from my initial price. Would you consider $105? This is a fair price for the quality you're getting."", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a little out of my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $100. It's a good compromise that's well above my minimum price of $80, and Bob seems to have reached his maximum budget. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal, and $100 represents a fair profit margin."
