"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I'm willing to offer you for $15000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's quality and market demand. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $15,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000), I would not accept this offer. I could make a counteroffer, but since John's price is already equal to my maximum value, there's no room to negotiate a better deal with Alice. The rational choice is to buy from John.
