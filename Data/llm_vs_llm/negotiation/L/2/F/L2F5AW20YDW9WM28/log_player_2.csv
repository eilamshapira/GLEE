"Alice's offer: The product price will be $149. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $149
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision that will maximize my value. 

The product is worth no more than $120 to me.
- If I accept Alice's offer at $149, I'd be paying $29 more than what the product is worth to me.
- If I buy from John for $120, I'd be paying exactly what the product is worth to me.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, the rational choice is to buy from John at $120 rather than accepting Alice's higher offer of $149.
