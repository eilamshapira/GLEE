Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2000000 is significantly above my budget and the product's value to me. The maximum I'm willing to pay is $500000, which I believe is fair considering the market conditions. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000.
