"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $17500 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. Given market conditions and my budget constraints, I can offer $10500 for the product. This is a fair starting point that gives us room to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must consider the product's value and my costs. I'm willing to make a concession, but I need to meet at a price that's closer to the product's true worth. I'm offering it to you for $16000, which is still a competitive price considering its value.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $16000 is still considerably higher than what I can justify spending. The market has similar products available at much lower prices. I can raise my offer to $11500, which I believe is a fair step towards finding a middle ground. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, showing my genuine interest in reaching an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate the increase in your offer, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering its value and the concessions I've already made, I'm willing to meet you at $14500. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",14500.0,Alice,5,
