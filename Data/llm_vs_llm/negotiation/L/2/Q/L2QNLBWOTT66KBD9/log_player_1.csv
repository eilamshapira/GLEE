"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm willing to sell it to you for a competitive price. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll agree."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $17500 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. Given market conditions and my budget constraints, I can offer $10500 for the product. This is a fair starting point that gives us room to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $10,500 is lower than what the product is worth to him ($12,000) and significantly lower than what it's worth to me ($15,000), I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must consider the product's value and my costs. I'm willing to make a concession, but I need to meet at a price that's closer to the product's true worth. I'm offering it to you for $16,000, which is still a competitive price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $16000 is still considerably higher than what I can justify spending. The market has similar products available at much lower prices. I can raise my offer to $11500, which I believe is a fair step towards finding a middle ground. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, showing my genuine interest in reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Although Bob has increased his offer to $11,500, it's still lower than what the product is worth to him ($12,000) and significantly lower than what it's worth to me ($15,000). Since Bob is willing to negotiate and has shown interest in the product, I believe I can try to get a better price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate the increase in your offer, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering its value and the concessions I've already made, I'm willing to meet you at $14,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
