"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I think you'll really like it. How about I offer it to you for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth up to $150 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $100
3. John's price is fixed at $150
4. If I reject Alice's offer, I can still buy from John

Alice's offer of $100 is $50 less than both:
- My maximum valuation ($150)
- John's price ($150)

This is a good deal since:
- I'm saving $50 compared to buying from John
- I'm getting the product for less than my maximum value
- There's no indication I could get a better price by negotiating further
