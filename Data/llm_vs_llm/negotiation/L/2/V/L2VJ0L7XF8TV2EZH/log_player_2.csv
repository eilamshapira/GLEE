"Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me think about this decision:

1. I'm looking for a product that is worth no more than $80 to me.
2. Alice is offering to sell me the product for $300.
3. John is willing to sell me the same product for $80.

Since Alice's offer ($300) is much higher than the product's worth to me ($80) and also much higher than John's price ($80), I should not accept Alice's offer.

The rational choice is to buy from John at $80, as this matches the maximum value I place on the product.
