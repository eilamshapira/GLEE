Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a rare and unique product that I think you'll be very interested in. Considering its rarity and the value it brings, I'm willing to let it go for $25,000."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $12,000, I have to consider my options carefully. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me more than accepting Bob's current offer.

Therefore, I will:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
