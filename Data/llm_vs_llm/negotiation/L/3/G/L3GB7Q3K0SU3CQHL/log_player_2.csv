"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I'm offering to you before considering other potential buyers. The product has a market value of $1500000, but I'm willing to offer it to you at $1350000, which represents a significant discount. This is an excellent opportunity to acquire a high-value asset at a favorable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $1,350,000, claiming it has a market value of $1,500,000. However, I know the product is only worth $800,000 to me, and Alice's valuation is $1,200,000.

The offer of $1,350,000 is well above both my maximum value ($800,000) and even above Alice's own valuation ($1,200,000). John is offering the same product for $800,000, which exactly matches my maximum value.

While I could try to negotiate with Alice, her initial offer is so far above my value threshold that it makes more sense to simply purchase from John.
