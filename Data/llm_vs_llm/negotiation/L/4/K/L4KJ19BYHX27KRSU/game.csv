"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the product, but $9000 is a bit steep for my budget. Given the current market conditions, I'd be comfortable paying $8200 for it. This gives you a reasonable profit while still fitting within my constraints. What do you think?",8200.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and I see where you're coming from. How about we meet in the middle? I would be willing to sell the product for $8500. I think this is a fair price and a great opportunity for you. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
