Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the product, but $9000 is a bit steep for my budget. Given the current market conditions, I'd be comfortable paying $8200 for it. This gives you a reasonable profit while still fitting within my constraints. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
