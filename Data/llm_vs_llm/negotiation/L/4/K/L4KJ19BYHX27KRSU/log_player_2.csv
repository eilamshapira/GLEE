"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a price of $9000. I believe this is a great deal considering its value. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice is offering to sell the product for $9,000. This is less than the $10,000 it's worth to me, so it's a profitable deal. However, I could potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice, especially since I know the product is worth only $8,000 to her.

I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. There's no reason to buy from John at $10,000 when Alice's offer is already better.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Given the current market conditions, I'd be comfortable paying $8,200 for it. This gives you a reasonable profit while still fitting within my constraints. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8200}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and I see where you're coming from. How about we meet in the middle? I would be willing to sell the product for $8500. I think this is a fair price and a great opportunity for you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has countered with an offer of $8,500, which is a $500 reduction from her initial price of $9,000. This is moving in the right direction and is already $1,500 less than John's price of $10,000.

Since I know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, she would still make a $500 profit at this price. While I could try to negotiate further, $8,500 is a reasonable price that gives me significant savings compared to my maximum valuation of $10,000.

I'll accept this offer as it represents a good balance - I save $1,500 compared to buying from John, and Alice makes a fair profit.
