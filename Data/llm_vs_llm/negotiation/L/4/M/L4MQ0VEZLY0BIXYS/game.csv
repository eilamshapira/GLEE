"Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Based on its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2500000.

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is significantly above my budget and market expectations. I have other options available, including a reliable seller offering the same product for $800000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $600000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600000 is well below the market value of this product, and even below the $800000 price you mentioned from another seller. Given the product's quality and value, and considering your interest in doing business together, I can reduce my initial price to $1800000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while reflecting the true value of the product. I believe this is a more reasonable starting point for our negotiation.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for lowering your price, Alice. However, $1800000 is still significantly above my maximum budget. While I appreciate the quality of your product, I need to be practical about my spending limits. As mentioned, I have a guaranteed option at $800000, but I'm willing to offer you $700000 for the product. This is higher than my previous offer and represents a fair value that works within my budget constraints.",700000.0,Bob,4,
