Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is significantly above my budget and market expectations. I have other options available, including a reliable seller offering the same product for $800000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $600000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and even lower than his claimed alternative of $800,000. His mention of another seller at $800,000 might be a negotiation tactic. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), I can continue negotiating with Bob for a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 is well below the market value of this product, and even below the $800,000 price you mentioned from another seller. Given the product's quality and value, and considering your interest in doing business together, I can reduce my initial price to $1,800,000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while reflecting the true value of the product. I believe this is a more reasonable starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for lowering your price, Alice. However, $1800000 is still significantly above my maximum budget. While I appreciate the quality of your product, I need to be practical about my spending limits. As mentioned, I have a guaranteed option at $800000, but I'm willing to offer you $700000 for the product. This is higher than my previous offer and represents a fair value that works within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

I'll sell to John for $1,000,000. Bob's offers have only increased by $100,000 (from $600,000 to $700,000), and he keeps referencing an $800,000 alternative while offering less than that amount. Since his offers remain significantly below my guaranteed price from John, and the negotiation pattern suggests he's unlikely to exceed $1,000,000, it's best to take the guaranteed offer from John."
