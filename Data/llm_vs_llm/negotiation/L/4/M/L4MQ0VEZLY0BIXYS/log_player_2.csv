"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Based on its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2500000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $2,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000, and it's also much higher than John's price. While I'll reject this offer and plan to make a counteroffer, I know I always have the option to buy from John at $800,000 if negotiations with Alice don't reach a reasonable price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,500,000 is significantly above my budget and market expectations. I have other options available, including a reliable seller offering the same product for $800,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600000 is well below the market value of this product, and even below the $800000 price you mentioned from another seller. Given the product's quality and value, and considering your interest in doing business together, I can reduce my initial price to $1800000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while reflecting the true value of the product. I believe this is a more reasonable starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,800,000, while lower than her initial offer, is still more than twice my maximum budget of $800,000. Since John's offer of $800,000 serves as my backup option, there's no reason to accept a price that's significantly higher. I'll continue negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a more reasonable price, but if the negotiations don't progress favorably, I can always fall back on John's offer."

This is higher than my previous offer and represents a fair value that works within my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
