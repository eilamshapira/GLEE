Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $95 is lower than my initial desired price and closer to my minimum of $80, and considering Bob's value of the product is $150, I believe there's room for negotiation to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Considering Bob's value of the product is $150 and his previous offer was $95, I'll aim for a price that's higher than his offer but still leaves room for negotiation. My counteroffer will be slightly lower than my initial offer to show willingness to negotiate.

{""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's new offer of $105 is higher than his previous one, indicating he's willing to pay more for the product. However, it's still below my desired price range, considering the product's value to him is $150. Since $105 is significantly higher than the $80 I could get from John, and Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, I'll continue negotiating to try and get closer to my target price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Given that Bob has increased his offer to $105, showing a willingness to pay more, and considering his value of the product is $150, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one to encourage further negotiation. This approach aims to meet Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous counteroffer.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer has increased again to $110, which is getting closer to a price that I might consider acceptable, given that it's still below my initial target but significantly above the $80 that John is offering. Considering Bob's value of the product is $150, there's still room for him to pay more. However, the negotiation has been progressing, and Bob's offers have been incrementally increasing, indicating a genuine interest in purchasing the product.

At this point, accepting $110 might be a reasonable compromise, especially since the difference between Bob's offer and my previous counteroffer is narrowing. Rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer risks Bob deciding not to continue negotiations, which could result in me having to sell to John for $80.
