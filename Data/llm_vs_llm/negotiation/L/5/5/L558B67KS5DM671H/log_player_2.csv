"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider my options carefully. 

Alice is offering the product for $140, while John is selling it for $150. The product is worth at most $150 to me, so Alice's offer is within my acceptable range. However, I know the product only costs Alice $80, so there's room for negotiation.

If I accept Alice's offer, I save $10 compared to buying from John, but I might be able to get an even better deal by negotiating.

If I reject and make a counteroffer, I can try to get a better price while still having John's $150 offer as a backup.

Given these considerations:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I see Alice has lowered her price from $140 to $130, which shows she's willing to negotiate. The product is worth $80 to her, so there's still room for further negotiation. Her current offer saves me $20 compared to John's price of $150, but I can likely get an even better deal.

I'll continue negotiating with Alice since she showed flexibility by reducing her price:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has reduced her price again from $130 to $120, showing she's continuing to be flexible in the negotiation. We're making good progress, and this price is now $30 less than John's offer of $150.

Given that Alice has moved from $140 to $130 to $120, and the product costs her $80, there's still some room for negotiation. I'll continue the process:
