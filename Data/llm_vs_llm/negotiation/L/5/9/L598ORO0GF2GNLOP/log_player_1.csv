"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to allow room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I know I can guarantee $150 by selling to John, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I still have several rounds to negotiate with Bob for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial price but still maintain a price well above my minimum threshold of $150.

{""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer equals what John is willing to pay ($150), and there's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer in future rounds, I should accept this offer. Continuing the negotiation might risk losing both Bob and getting no better than $150 from John anyway.
