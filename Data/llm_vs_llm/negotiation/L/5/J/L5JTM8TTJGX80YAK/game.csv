"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Based on my market research and budget, I can offer $6000 for the product. This is a fair price considering current market conditions.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your response, but $6000 is quite a bit lower than I can accept. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to offer the product for $12500. Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12500 is still considerably above my budget. I have another seller offering the same product for $8000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $7000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. How does that sound?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible. While I appreciate your position, I can't go as low as $7000. How about we settle at $10000? It's still a great deal for the value of this product. Let me know!",10000.0,Alice,5,
