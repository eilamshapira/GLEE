Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Based on my market research and budget, I can offer $6000 for the product. This is a fair price considering current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your response, but $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I can accept. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to offer the product for $12,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12500 is still considerably above my budget. I have another seller offering the same product for $8000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $7000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. How does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
