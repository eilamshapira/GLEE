"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it could bring you great value. I'm offering it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
2. Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value
3. I have the option to buy from John for $8,000 at any time
4. Alice's initial offer is almost double my maximum value

I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. There's room for negotiation, and since I have 10 rounds, it's worth trying to get a better deal than John's $8,000 price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Based on my market research and budget, I can offer $6,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering current market conditions."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your response, but $6000 is quite a bit lower than I can accept. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to offer the product for $12500. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that:
1. The product is still worth no more than $8,000 to me
2. Alice's new offer of $12,500 is still significantly above my maximum value
3. John's offer of $8,000 remains available
4. Alice did reduce her price, but not enough to make it attractive

Since Alice's offer is still well above both my maximum value and John's price, I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer. If we can't reach a reasonable price soon, I'll consider taking John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly but make it clear that I have alternative options available.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still considerably above my budget. I have another seller offering the same product for $8,000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $7,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible. While I appreciate your position, I can't go as low as $7000. How about we settle at $10000? It's still a great deal for the value of this product. Let me know! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
2. Alice's new offer of $10,000 is still above both my maximum value and John's price
3. John's offer of $8,000 is looking increasingly attractive
4. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Alice is still above my maximum value

At this point, it's clear that Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000, and continuing the negotiation might not be productive. Since I can get the product from John for $8,000, which is at my maximum value point, it makes the most sense to take John's offer now.
