"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the product's value, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose $900000 for it. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This still allows for a good profit for me and leaves room for negotiation.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
