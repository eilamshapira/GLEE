"Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $250 because:
1. The product is only worth up to $150 to me
2. I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $150
3. There's no reason to accept a price higher than my maximum value
4. I can make a counteroffer to Alice and potentially get an even better deal than John's price"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 100}

I'm offering $100 because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $150
2. It gives room for negotiation if Alice counter-offers
3. If Alice rejects, I still have the option to buy from John at $150
4. Starting low allows me to potentially get a better deal than John's price
5. Even if Alice rejects this offer, we can continue negotiating to find a mutually acceptable price"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $220. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $220
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $220 because:
1. It's still above both my maximum value ($150) and John's price ($150)
2. Alice has lowered her price from $250 to $220, showing willingness to negotiate
3. I can continue negotiating to try to get a better price
4. I still have the safety net of buying from John at $150
5. There's no reason to accept a price above $150 when I have a guaranteed option at $150"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 120}

I'm offering $120 because:
1. It's an increase from my previous offer of $100, showing I'm willing to negotiate in good faith
2. It's still below my maximum value of $150 and John's price
3. It leaves room for further negotiation while moving closer to a middle ground
4. It's a significant increase from my last offer, which might show Alice I'm serious about making a deal
5. If Alice rejects, I still have the option to buy from John at $150, so I'm not risking anything"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll buy from John for $150 because:
1. Alice's latest offer ($200) is still above my maximum value ($150)
2. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Alice's offers remain above $150
3. Alice's rate of price reduction (from $250 -> $220 -> $200) suggests she's unlikely to go below $150
4. John's price ($150) matches my maximum value
5. Continuing to negotiate with Alice might not lead to a better outcome, and I risk wasting time
6. A guaranteed option at my maximum acceptable price is better than continuing uncertain negotiations"
