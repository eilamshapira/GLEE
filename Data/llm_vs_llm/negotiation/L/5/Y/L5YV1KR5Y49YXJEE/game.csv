"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe $1100000 is quite high for this product. I've done my market research, and I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. This would still provide you with a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me. I look forward to your response.",900000.0,Bob,2,
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your position, $900000 is below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which I feel is a fair compromise given the value this product brings to you. Please let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower the price further to $1000000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and should reflect the value you'll gain from the product. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. You've moved $100000, and I want to show that I'm also willing to be flexible. I can increase my offer to $940000, which represents a fair price for both of us. This gives you a healthy profit margin while being more aligned with market values. Would you consider this offer?",940000.0,Bob,4,
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $940000 is still below the value I place on the product. I'm prepared to meet you halfway and reduce the price to $980000. This should be a fair compromise considering the benefits the product will provide to you. Please let me know if this works for you.",980000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I see we're getting closer to an agreement. To show my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to lower the price further to $960000. This offer reflects a significant discount and should be within your budget while still providing me with a reasonable return. What are your thoughts on this?",960000.0,Alice,5,
