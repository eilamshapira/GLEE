Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe $1100000 is quite high for this product. I've done my market research, and I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. This would still provide you with a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me. I look forward to your response.
