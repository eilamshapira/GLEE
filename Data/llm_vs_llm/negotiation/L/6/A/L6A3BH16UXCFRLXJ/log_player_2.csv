"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to me and Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is higher than that, it doesn't make sense to accept the offer. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which is within my budget. However, I'd like to try to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to me, I'll offer a price that is slightly lower than that.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,350,000 is still higher than the product's worth to me, which is $1,200,000. However, it's a slight improvement from her initial offer of $1,400,000.

I'm not willing to pay more than the product's worth to me, so I'll reject Alice's offer again. I'll try to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price that's closer to $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $1,350,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between her offer and my previous counteroffer of $1,000,000, but still keep it below the product's worth to me, which is $1,200,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,250,000 is very close to the product's worth to me, which is $1,200,000. However, it's still $50,000 higher than what I'm willing to pay.

At this point, I have to consider that buying from John for $1,200,000 is a viable option, and it's actually a better deal for me than Alice's current offer. Since Alice's offer is so close to my limit, I think it's unlikely that she'll be willing to go lower than $1,250,000.

Given the options, I think it's best to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, as it's the best deal for me.
