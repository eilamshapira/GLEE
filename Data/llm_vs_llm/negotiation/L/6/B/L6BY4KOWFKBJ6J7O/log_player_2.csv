(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's initial offer of $140 is close to my maximum budget of $150, but still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, I'll choose to reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I don't know how flexible Alice is with her pricing, I'll start with a slightly lower offer and see how she responds.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after some consideration, I'm willing to lower my price a bit more. Would you be interested in purchasing the product for $135? I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has lowered her price to $135, which is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. However, it's a more reasonable offer than her initial one. Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I'll choose to reject this offer and make another counteroffer to see if I can get an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one, but still lower than Alice's current offer. This will show that I'm willing to compromise and meet her halfway.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for lowering your price to $135. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 125}"
