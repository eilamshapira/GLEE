"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to consider the options carefully here:

1. Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.
2. I could reject and make a counteroffer, potentially getting a better price.
3. I could buy from John for $1,000,000, which is the same as Alice's current offer.

Since Alice's offer is at my maximum valuation, and John's price is exactly the same, there's no advantage to immediately accepting Alice's offer or going to John. However, by making a counteroffer, I might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price to leave room for negotiation, while still being reasonable.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has lowered her offer from $1,000,000 to $700,000, which is a significant reduction of $300,000. This is a much better deal than buying from John at $1,000,000.

I could try to negotiate further with another counteroffer, but there's always a risk that Alice might become less flexible or withdraw this offer. Since I've already saved $300,000 from my maximum budget, and this is a substantial discount, I'll accept this offer.
