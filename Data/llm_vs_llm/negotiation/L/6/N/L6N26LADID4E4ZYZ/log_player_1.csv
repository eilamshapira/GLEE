Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make a strategic initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to him and $800,000 to me, I'll start with a high offer to leave room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

{""product_price"": 1,100,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to him ($1,200,000), and it's only $100,000 above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000), I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I believe there's still room for negotiation to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial $1,100,000 but still maintain a strong position, considering the product's value to Bob and leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

{""product_price"": 1,000,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob has increased his offer by $50,000 to $950,000, which is a reasonable improvement. While there might still be room to negotiate higher, there's also a risk that prolonged negotiation could lead to Bob walking away. The current offer gives me a $150,000 premium over John's guaranteed $800,000, which is a good profit. I'll accept this offer.
