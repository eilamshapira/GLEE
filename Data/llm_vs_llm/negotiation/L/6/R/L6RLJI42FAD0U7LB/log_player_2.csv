"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering the product for $140, which is less than the $150 it's worth to me and less than John's fixed price of $150.

However, since the product is worth only $100 to Alice, there's room for negotiation to get a better price. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer to try to save more money.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I see that Alice has come down from $140 to $130, which shows she's willing to negotiate. Since the product is worth $100 to her, there's still room for us to meet somewhere in the middle. Her new offer of $130 is better than John's fixed price of $150, but I should try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a better deal.
