Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make an offer to Bob for the product. I know it's worth at least $150 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150 if Bob declines.

I should set a price higher than my minimum value of $150, but not so high that Bob will certainly reject it. Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll set a reasonable markup that gives me a good profit while still being potentially acceptable to Bob.
