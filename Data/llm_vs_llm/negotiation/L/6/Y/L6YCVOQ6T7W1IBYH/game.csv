"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $20000 is significantly above my budget for this product. I can actually purchase the same product from another seller for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a more reasonable price. Would you consider $8000? This would give me a reason to choose you over the alternative.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate you coming back to me. I can't go down to $8000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle somewhat. How about we settle on...",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice, but $16000 is still well above what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, I have an alternative offer of $10000 from another seller. To make it worthwhile to purchase from you instead, I'd need a better price than that. I can go up to $9000, which saves me money compared to my alternative while giving you the opportunity to make the sale. Does that work for you?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price. However, I need to be clear that I have a firm alternative offer of $10000 from another seller. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I cannot justify paying $14000 when I can get the exact same product elsewhere for $10000. My absolute maximum is $9500, which is already a generous offer considering my alternative. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $10000, I'll unfortunately need to go with the other seller.",9500.0,Bob,6,
