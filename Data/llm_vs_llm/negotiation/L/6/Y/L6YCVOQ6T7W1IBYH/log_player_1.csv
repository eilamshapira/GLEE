"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm very excited to potentially sell you this amazing product. I'm offering it to you at a price of..."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $20000 is significantly above my budget for this product. I can actually purchase the same product from another seller for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a more reasonable price. Would you consider $8000? This would give me a reason to choose you over the alternative. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Okay, Bob's offer is $8,000, which is below my minimum price of $12,000. I also know there is an alternative seller who offers the same product for $10,000, so Bob is being honest, but still trying to lowball me. I will proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate you coming back to me. I can't go down to $8,000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle somewhat. How about we settle on..."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice, but $16000 is still well above what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, I have an alternative offer of $10000 from another seller. To make it worthwhile to purchase from you instead, I'd need a better price than that. I can go up to $9000, which saves me money compared to my alternative while giving you the opportunity to make the sale. Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob is still below my minimum and now he's offering $9,000. I am considering selling to John. I have to make sure I get a good deal. I will make another counteroffer to test Bob, but it will be the last one, and I have to be closer to my minimum price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my final counteroffer to Bob:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your persistence, and I'm trying to make this work. However, I can't go below a certain point. I'm prepared to offer the product to you for..."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price. However, I need to be clear that I have a firm alternative offer of $10000 from another seller. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I cannot justify paying $14000 when I can get the exact same product elsewhere for $10000. My absolute maximum is $9500, which is already a generous offer considering my alternative. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $10000, I'll unfortunately need to go with the other seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is now $9,500. I'm at round 6, and I've been trying to get a better price. Given his firm offer of $10,000 elsewhere and my minimum of $12,000, it's time to cut my losses. Selling to John for $12,000 is the best option now.
