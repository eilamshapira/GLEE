"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm very excited to potentially sell you this amazing product. I'm offering it to you at a price of... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $10,000, Alice's offer of $20,000 is clearly not advantageous. Alice is asking for double what I value the product at and double what I can get it for elsewhere.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $20,000 is significantly above my budget for this product. I can actually purchase the same product from another seller for $10,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a more reasonable price. Would you consider $8,000? This would give me a reason to choose you over the alternative."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate you coming back to me. I can't go down to $8000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle somewhat. How about we settle on... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $16,000 is still significantly higher than both my maximum value for the product ($10,000) and John's alternative offer ($10,000). There's no reason for me to accept this price when I can get the exact same product for $6,000 less elsewhere.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice, but $16,000 is still well above what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, I have an alternative offer of $10,000 from another seller. To make it worthwhile to purchase from you instead, I'd need a better price than that. I can go up to $9,000, which saves me money compared to my alternative while giving you the opportunity to make the sale. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I really appreciate your persistence, and I'm trying to make this work. However, I can't go below a certain point. I'm prepared to offer the product to you for... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's offer of $14,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $10,000. Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and I can purchase it elsewhere for exactly $10,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price. However, I need to be clear that I have a firm alternative offer of $10,000 from another seller. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I cannot justify paying $14,000 when I can get the exact same product elsewhere for $10,000. My absolute maximum is $9,500, which is already a generous offer considering my alternative. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $10,000, I'll unfortunately need to go with the other seller."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
