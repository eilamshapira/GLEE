"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm glad you're interested in the product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that reflects its value. I'm offering it to you for $1499999 is not an option as I can get 1500000 from another buyer. However I want to sell to you so I am willing to sell for 1499999.99 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,499,999.99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,499,999.99
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,499,999.99 is very close to the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,500,000) and it's actually slightly less, I'll choose to accept the offer to save a tiny bit of money.
