Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2400000}

Rationale: As a seller, I should aim to maximize my profit while considering my fallback option. Since I know I can definitely sell the product to John for $1,200,000, I can afford to make a higher offer to Bob. By setting the price at $2,400,000 (twice my minimum acceptable value), I:

1. Create potential for a significant profit if Bob accepts
2. Have a safe fallback with John if Bob rejects
3. Leave room for possible negotiation while still maintaining a good profit margin
4. Set an anchor price that suggests high value for the product

If Bob rejects this offer, I lose nothing since I can still sell to John at my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000."
