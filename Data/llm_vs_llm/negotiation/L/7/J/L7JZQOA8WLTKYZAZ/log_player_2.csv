"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me evaluate this situation:

I'm looking for a product that is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me.
Alice is offering me the product for $2,400,000.
John is willing to sell me the same product for $1,000,000.

Since Alice's offer ($2,400,000) is significantly higher than both the product's value to me and John's price, the best decision is to buy from John.
