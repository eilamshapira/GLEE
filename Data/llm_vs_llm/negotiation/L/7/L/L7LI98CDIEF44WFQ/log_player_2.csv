"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product today. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $20000. This product has been carefully developed and has significant value in the current market. If you're interested, I can provide more details about its features and benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The reasoning is simple:
1. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $20,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $12,000
4. By buying from John, I can get the product at a price that matches my maximum valuation
5. This is the most economical choice that still allows me to obtain the product"
