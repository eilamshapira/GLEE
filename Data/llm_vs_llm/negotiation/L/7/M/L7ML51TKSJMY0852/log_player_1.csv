"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I understand that we both want to find a fair price. Based on my budget and the market value, I'm willing to raise my offer to $11000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $11,000 because it's still relatively close to the minimum value I have in mind for the product, which is $10,000. Since Bob is willing to negotiate and has already increased his offer, I believe there's potential for him to go higher. I'll proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round to try and reach a more satisfactory price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the product's value exceeds your current offer. I'm willing to consider a serious buyer like yourself, so I'll slightly adjust my initial price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I believe we can find a middle ground that benefits both of us. I'm willing to raise my offer to $13000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $13,000. Although Bob is continuing to increase his offer, which is a positive sign, the price is still below what I consider to be the product's true value. Given that we are only in Round 4 and there are 6 rounds left, I believe there is room for further negotiation. I will proceed to make another counteroffer, aiming to meet Bob somewhere in the middle but closer to my initial valuation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you, Bob, for your continued efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $13,000. Considering your latest proposal, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer.
