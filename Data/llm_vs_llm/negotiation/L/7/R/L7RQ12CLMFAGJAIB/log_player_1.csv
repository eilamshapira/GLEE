"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I have a great product to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. Since Bob is willing to pay $120 (which is the same as John's offer), there might be room for negotiation to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot go that low. Given the product's quality and features, I can offer it to you for $150. This is already a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair value for what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 150}"
