"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my premium product to you for $10000. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is the maximum price I'm willing to pay. There's no point in accepting it since I might be able to get a better deal. I should make a counteroffer significantly lower to see how much wiggle room there is."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering your product.  $10,000 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $5,000?"",
""product_price"": 5000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I've started with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while staying well below my maximum budget.  By being polite but firm, I'm hoping to gauge Alice's flexibility on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that $10000 might be too high for you. However, $5000 is too low for me. Would you consider meeting me in the middle at $8500? This way, we both make a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is willing to negotiate, $8,500 is still a significant amount. I want to see if I can push the price down further. It's worth another counteroffer before considering John's offer."

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $7,000?  That would really help me out."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm incrementally increasing my offer while staying firm that I need a lower price. By being open about my budget constraints, I'm hoping to encourage Alice to meet me closer to my desired price point."
