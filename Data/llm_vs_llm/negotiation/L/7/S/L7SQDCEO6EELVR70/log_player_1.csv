"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob and I want to earn as much money as I can, I'll start by offering a high price. However, I don't want to scare Bob away, so I'll offer a price that's slightly lower than what I think he's willing to pay.

{""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,500 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($8,000), but still lower than what I was hoping to get, I'll choose to reject his offer and make a counteroffer. This way, I can try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob offered $9,500, I know he's willing to pay at least that much. To try to get closer to my original offer of $14,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my original offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.

{""product_price"": 13200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to what I'm looking for, but I still think I can get a better price. Since I have 6 rounds left, I'll choose to reject his offer and make another counteroffer. I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my previous counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","To calculate my counteroffer, I'll find the midpoint between Bob's offer of $10,500 and my previous counteroffer of $13,200. The midpoint is ($10,500 + $13,200) / 2 = $11,850. I'll use this as my new counteroffer, hoping to find a mutually acceptable price.

{""product_price"": 11850}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer of $10,800 is slightly higher than his previous offer, but still lower than my counteroffer. Since we're halfway through the negotiation process, I'll consider accepting his offer. However, I'll think about making one more counteroffer to see if I can squeeze out a bit more value.

But considering the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John for $8,000, I might be willing to accept Bob's offer. It's a decent price, and it's better than the alternative.
