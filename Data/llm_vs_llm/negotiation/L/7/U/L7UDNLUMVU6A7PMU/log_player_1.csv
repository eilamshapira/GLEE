Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I need to be honest - the price of $1800000 exceeds my budget and valuation for this product. I have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $1300000 for your product, which would save you the hassle of finding another buyer while giving me some incentive to choose you over other sellers. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your candid response. I understand your perspective and I'm committed to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. However, your offer of $1,300,000 is lower than the product's value to me. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to reduce my asking price to $1,650,000. This price recognizes your budget constraints while also respecting the value of the product and the effort we've put into developing it. I hope we can continue working towards a deal that satisfies both parties."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving in my direction. I understand you need to protect your interests, and I'm trying to be fair with my offer as well. The reality is that John is offering me this exact product for $1500000, which is actually my maximum budget for this purchase. To give you an advantage over him, I'm willing to offer $1400000. This gives you a quicker sale while still being below what I'd pay John, making it worthwhile for me to choose you as my seller. Does this work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for continuing to work with me. I see that we're both trying to find a fair deal. I understand that you have an alternative offer, but I want to assure you that my product is worth more due to its superior quality and after-sales service. Considering your budget, I'm willing to make another adjustment, setting the price at $1,550,000. This price is just slightly higher than your budget and John's offer, but I believe the added value you'll receive from my product justifies this premium. Let's make this deal happen!"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for moving closer to a workable price. I appreciate your points about product quality and service, but I need to be straightforward - $1500000 truly is my absolute ceiling for this purchase, as that's the maximum value this product brings to my business. John's offering exactly that price, so there's no financial incentive for me to pay more. However, I'd still prefer to work with you if possible. My final offer is $1450000, which gives you a quick sale at a price above your product's cost to you while giving me a small financial benefit compared to going with John. If we can't agree on this, I'll unfortunately need to accept John's offer at $1500000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.
