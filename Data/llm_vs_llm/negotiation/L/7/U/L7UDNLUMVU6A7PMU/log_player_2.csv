"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm setting the price at $1800000. I believe this reflects the product's quality and the benefits it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer against the value of the product to me.

Alice is offering the product for $1,800,000, but the product is only worth $1,500,000 to me. Since I should never pay more than what the product is worth to me, and John is offering exactly at my maximum valuation, Alice's current offer doesn't make financial sense.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I need to be honest - the price of $1,800,000 exceeds my budget and valuation for this product. I have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $1,500,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for your product, which would save you the hassle of finding another buyer while giving me some incentive to choose you over other sellers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your candid response. I understand your perspective and I'm committed to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. However, your offer of $1300000 is lower than the product's value to me. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to reduce my asking price to $1650000. This price recognizes your budget constraints while also respecting the value of the product and the effort we've put into developing it. I hope we can continue working towards a deal that satisfies both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has lowered her price to $1,650,000, which is still above the $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me and what John is offering. Since I shouldn't pay more than what the product is worth to me, and I have a guaranteed option to purchase at my maximum valuation from John, it makes sense to reject Alice's current offer and continue negotiating.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving in my direction. I understand you need to protect your interests, and I'm trying to be fair with my offer as well. The reality is that John is offering me this exact product for $1,500,000, which is actually my maximum budget for this purchase. To give you an advantage over him, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This gives you a quicker sale while still being below what I'd pay John, making it worthwhile for me to choose you as my seller. Does this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for continuing to work with me. I see that we're both trying to find a fair deal. I understand that you have an alternative offer, but I want to assure you that my product is worth more due to its superior quality and after-sales service. Considering your budget, I'm willing to make another adjustment, setting the price at $1550000. This price is just slightly higher than your budget and John's offer, but I believe the added value you'll receive from my product justifies this premium. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $1,550,000, which is still above the $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me and what John is offering. Even though Alice claims her product has superior quality and after-sales service, the scenario states that I'm looking for a product worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, which means I've already accounted for all product factors in my valuation.

Since Alice's offer still exceeds my maximum valuation, and John is offering exactly at my maximum valuation, it makes sense to reject Alice's current offer and continue negotiating.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for moving closer to a workable price. I appreciate your points about product quality and service, but I need to be straightforward - $1,500,000 truly is my absolute ceiling for this purchase, as that's the maximum value this product brings to my business. John's offering exactly that price, so there's no financial incentive for me to pay more. However, I'd still prefer to work with you if possible. My final offer is $1,450,000, which gives you a quick sale at a price above your product's cost to you while giving me a small financial benefit compared to going with John. If we can't agree on this, I'll unfortunately need to accept John's offer at $1,500,000."", ""product_price"": 1450000}"
