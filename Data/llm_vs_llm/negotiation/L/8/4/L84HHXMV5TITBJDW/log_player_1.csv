"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,200,000) and also lower than what the product is worth to him ($800,000), I will reject his offer and proceed to make a counteroffer that is closer to my target price but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Considering Bob's offer of $600,000 and knowing the product is worth $800,000 to him, I'll make a counteroffer that is still high but shows a willingness to negotiate. My goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible while trying to meet Bob halfway.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's new offer of $700,000 is closer to what the product is worth to him ($800,000), but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Since we are only in Round 4 and I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, I will reject Bob's offer again and try to bring the price closer to my target.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Given that Bob has increased his offer to $700,000, which is getting closer to the $800,000 value he places on the product, I will slightly adjust my counteroffer to encourage further negotiation. My aim is to meet Bob somewhere in between while ensuring I get a good deal.
