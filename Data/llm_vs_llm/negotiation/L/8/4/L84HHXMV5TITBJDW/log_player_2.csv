"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I will start with a low counteroffer since Alice started with her maximum price. I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to her, and I won't pay more than $800,000 (since I can get it from John at that price).

{""product_price"": 600000}

This offer gives room for negotiation while still being significantly below my maximum price point of $800,000. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground, but I always have the option to go to John if we can't reach an agreement below $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still above my maximum value of $800,000 (which is also John's price), I'll reject this offer. There's no reason for me to pay more than $800,000 when I have that as a guaranteed alternative with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'm increasing my offer to $700,000, which is still below my maximum of $800,000. This shows some movement towards compromise while maintaining my negotiating position. If Alice doesn't accept this or come back with a counter below $800,000, I can always go to John. There's no reason for me to go above $800,000 since that's my alternative option with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is still not willing to offer a price at or below $800,000, which is my maximum acceptable price and the price John is offering. Since we've gone through several rounds and Alice's offers remain significantly above my maximum ($950,000 is still $150,000 more than John's price), it's best to end the negotiation and buy from John for $800,000. This ensures I get the product at my maximum acceptable price without wasting more time in negotiations."
