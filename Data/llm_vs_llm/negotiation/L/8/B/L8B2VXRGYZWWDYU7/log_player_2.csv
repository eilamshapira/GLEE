"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's offer of $180 is above the maximum value the product is worth to me ($150), and it's also higher than John's price ($150). Since I can get the product from John at a price that is exactly equal to my maximum valuation, it makes more sense to buy from John rather than accept Alice's above-value offer or engage in potentially unsuccessful negotiations.
