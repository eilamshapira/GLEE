,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $16000 is too high for me. The product is worth no more than $12000 to me, and I have another seller (John) who can sell me the same product for $12000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a better price. Would you consider $10000 for the product?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, after considering your perspective, I'm willing to lower my price to $14000 to meet you halfway. This is a high-quality product, and I believe it's worth the investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14000 is still more than I can justify paying. As I mentioned, John is offering the same product for $12000, which is already my maximum budget. For me to choose to do business with you instead, I would need a better price than that. I can offer $11000, which would save me $1000 compared to John's offer while still giving you a fair deal considering the product is worth $12000 to you.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, after considering your last offer, I'm willing to match John's offer and sell the product to you for $12000. This is my final offer and is a fair deal for both parties. I can guarantee you a quality product, and personalized service from me. Let's make this deal happen.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for matching John's price of $12000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Since we've been discussing this deal for a while now, and I'd like to finalize our business arrangement, I'm asking if you could do $11500? That would give me a small savings compared to John's offer and would make my decision to go with you very easy. This seems fair since the product is worth $12000 to both of us.",11500.0,Bob,6,
