Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $16000 is too high for me. The product is worth no more than $12000 to me, and I have another seller (John) who can sell me the same product for $12000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a better price. Would you consider $10000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14000 is still more than I can justify paying. As I mentioned, John is offering the same product for $12000, which is already my maximum budget. For me to choose to do business with you instead, I would need a better price than that. I can offer $11000, which would save me $1000 compared to John's offer while still giving you a fair deal considering the product is worth $12000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for matching John's price of $12000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Since we've been discussing this deal for a while now, and I'd like to finalize our business arrangement, I'm asking if you could do $11500? That would give me a small savings compared to John's offer and would make my decision to go with you very easy. This seems fair since the product is worth $12000 to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
