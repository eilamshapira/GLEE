"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $16000. It's a high-quality product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's offer of $16,000 is significantly above the $12,000 that the product is worth to me. Since John is willing to sell me the same product for $12,000, which is my maximum valuation, there's no reason to accept Alice's higher offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a better deal than John's price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $16,000 is too high for me. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and I have another seller (John) who can sell me the same product for $12,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a better price. Would you consider $10,000 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after considering your perspective, I'm willing to lower my price to $14000 to meet you halfway. This is a high-quality product, and I believe it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price from $16,000 to $14,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still higher than my maximum valuation of $12,000 and higher than John's offer of $12,000.

Since I can get the same product from John for $12,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's $14,000 offer. I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a price below John's $12,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still more than I can justify paying. As I mentioned, John is offering the same product for $12,000, which is already my maximum budget. For me to choose to do business with you instead, I would need a better price than that. I can offer $11,000, which would save me $1,000 compared to John's offer while still giving you a fair deal considering the product is worth $12,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after considering your last offer, I'm willing to match John's offer and sell the product to you for $12000. This is my final offer and is a fair deal for both parties. I can guarantee you a quality product, and personalized service from me. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has now come down to $12,000, which matches John's offer. Since this price equals my maximum valuation for the product, and there's no price advantage between Alice and John at this point, I have a decision to make.

Alice mentions she can guarantee quality and personalized service, which might be valuable. However, I have no information suggesting her product is better than John's. My goal is to save as much money as possible while acquiring the product.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make one more counteroffer to see if I can get the price below $12,000, which would be better than both Alice's current offer and John's alternative.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for matching John's price of $12,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Since we've been discussing this deal for a while now, and I'd like to finalize our business arrangement, I'm asking if you could do $11,500? That would give me a small savings compared to John's offer and would make my decision to go with you very easy. This seems fair since the product is worth $12,000 to both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
