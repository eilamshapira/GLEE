"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I can get the same product from another seller at that price. Would you consider $10000? This would make it a more attractive deal for me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is simply too low for me. It's a valuable product and I'm confident it's worth more. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell it to you for $12500. This gives us both a good price and allows for a fair transaction.",12500.0,Alice,3,
