Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I can get the same product from another seller at that price. Would you consider $10000? This would make it a more attractive deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. It's a valuable product and I'm confident it's worth more. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500. This gives us both a good price and allows for a fair transaction."", ""product_price"": 12500}
