"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's alternative price ($10,000). It would be unwise to accept this offer as it would result in a $5,000 loss compared to my maximum valuation. Since I have the option to buy from John at $10,000, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer to Alice. If negotiations with Alice don't lead to a better price, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9000}

I'll offer $9,000 to Alice. Here's my reasoning:
1. I know the product is worth $12,000 to Alice
2. My maximum value is $10,000
3. I have a backup option of $10,000 from John
4. By offering $9,000, I:
   - Leave room for negotiation
   - Could save $1,000 compared to John's price
   - Still offer a price that, while below Alice's cost, might lead to further negotiation
   - Stay well within my maximum value

If Alice rejects this, we can continue negotiating, or I can always go with John's offer of $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $10,000. Here's why:
1. Alice's new offer of $14,000 is still well above my maximum value ($10,000)
2. Alice has only reduced her price by $1,000 from her initial offer, suggesting she's unlikely to come down to a price below $10,000
3. The product costs Alice $12,000, so she's unlikely to accept any offer below that
4. John's offer of $10,000 is:
   - Equal to my maximum value
   - Much better than Alice's current offer
   - A guaranteed option

Rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to result in a better price than John's offer, it's best to take the sure deal from John at $10,000."
