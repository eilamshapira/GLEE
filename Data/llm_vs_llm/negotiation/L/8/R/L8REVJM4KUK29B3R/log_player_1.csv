Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob and I know I can always sell it to John for $12,000, I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I make a profit.

{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","I will reject Bob's offer of $9,000 since it's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and I can guarantee $12,000 from John. However, instead of immediately selling to John, I'll make one more attempt to negotiate with Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob countered with $9,000, which is significantly lower than my initial offer of $15,000, I'll adjust my price downward but still keep it above my minimum of $12,000.

{""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, it would be best to end the negotiation with Bob and sell to John. The negotiation doesn't seem to be moving towards a price above $12,000.
