Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $1,750,000. This is above Bob's estimated value, but it leaves room for negotiation and still gives me a good profit. I'm confident that John's offer of $1,500,000 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 
 
I'm reducing my price to $1,600,000. This is still higher than Bob's initial offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise and come closer to his price. It also keeps my profit above John's offer, making it a better deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is now within a range where I can still earn a decent profit. This also avoids further rounds of negotiation, saving time and energy.  Additionally, I'm still better off than selling to John."
