Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer that's well above Bob's valuation but leaves some room for negotiation if needed. Since I know I have John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 as a backup, I can negotiate from a position of strength.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $700,000 is below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and even below his own valuation ($800,000), and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Bob.
