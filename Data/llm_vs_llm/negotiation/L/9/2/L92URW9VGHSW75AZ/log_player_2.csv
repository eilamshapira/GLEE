"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000, and also higher than Alice's own valuation of $1,000,000. It would be better to reject this offer and make a counteroffer, or potentially buy from John for $800,000 if negotiations with Alice don't improve. Since John's price serves as a reliable backup option, there's no reason to accept such a high price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'll offer $700,000, which is below John's price of $800,000. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to John's offer. Since Alice values the product at $1,000,000, there might be room to find a price that works for both of us between my offer and Alice's valuation, while still staying below my maximum of $800,000."
