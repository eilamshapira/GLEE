Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob.

I need to consider a price between my minimum value ($80) and Bob's maximum value ($150). If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed $80 from John, so I should set a price higher than $80 but attractive enough that Bob will accept.

Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, I'll offer a price that gives him some surplus while maximizing my earnings. I'll set the price at $125, which gives Bob a $25 surplus while giving me significantly more than my fallback option.
