"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is clearly above my maximum value of $1,500,000, and it's also higher than John's price. There's no reason to accept this offer. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, starting with a lower price to leave room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be insulting.

{""product_price"": 800000}

This offer is significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer and John's price, which gives room for negotiation. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground that's still below my maximum value of $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $2,200,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's price ($1,500,000). While Alice has reduced the price by $300,000 from her initial offer, it's still not close enough to make it worthwhile. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round, moving up slightly from my previous offer to show willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintain a good margin below my maximum value.

{""product_price"": 1000000}

This offer is $200,000 higher than my previous offer, showing good faith in negotiations. It's still well below my maximum value of $1,500,000, giving room for further negotiation while also potentially saving me money compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is still above John's price of $1,500,000, so there's no reason to accept it. While Alice is moving in the right direction (having dropped from $2.5M to $1.8M), I still have John's guaranteed offer of $1.5M as my backup. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, moving up slightly again to show continued willingness to negotiate, but keeping in mind that I won't go above $1.5M since that's my alternative option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'm raising my offer by $200,000 again to show continued good faith in negotiations. This price is still $300,000 below John's price, which gives me room to potentially save money while also showing Alice that I'm making meaningful increases in my offers. If Alice doesn't accept a price below $1,500,000 soon, I may need to consider taking John's offer, as we're already in round 6 of 10."
