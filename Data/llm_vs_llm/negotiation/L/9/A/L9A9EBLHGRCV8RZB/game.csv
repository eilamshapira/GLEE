"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While $145 is below market value, I know that the product's costs are considerably lower. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $125, which gives you a reasonable profit while allowing me to save a bit more. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $125 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm going to make a counteroffer of $140. This price still offers you a good deal while ensuring I meet my needs. What do you say?",,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"Thanks for coming down in price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Given that I can get this product elsewhere for $150, I'd like to meet you closer to the middle at $130. This gives you a good $10 profit over your cost while saving me some money too. Do we have a deal?",130.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I think $130 is a fair price. Let's go ahead with the deal. Thanks for negotiating!",,Alice,4,AcceptOffer
