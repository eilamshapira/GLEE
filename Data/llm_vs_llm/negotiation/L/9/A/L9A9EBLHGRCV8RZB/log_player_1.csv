# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While $145 is below market value, I know that the product's costs are considerably lower. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $125, which gives you a reasonable profit while allowing me to save a bit more. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
