"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $145. It's a great deal considering its value and quality! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I should analyze this offer from Alice. She's offering the product for $145, which is below my maximum value of $150. However, I know the product is only worth $120 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.

If I accept Alice's offer, I save $5 compared to buying from John at $150.
If I reject and make a counteroffer, I might be able to get a better price.
Buying from John would cost me $150, which is clearly not optimal at this point.

Since I can always fall back to John's offer of $150 if negotiations with Alice fail, I should try to negotiate a better price with Alice first.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $125 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm going to make a counteroffer of $140. This price still offers you a good deal while ensuring I meet my needs. What do you say?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has lowered her price from $145 to $140, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is still $10 below John's price of $150, so it's already a better deal than my fallback option. However, since the product is worth $120 to Alice, there's still room to negotiate a better price for myself.

I should continue negotiating to try getting a better price, especially since I know I can always accept John's offer if needed.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down in price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Given that I can get this product elsewhere for $150, I'd like to meet you closer to the middle at $130. This gives you a good $10 profit over your cost while saving me some money too. Do we have a deal?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
