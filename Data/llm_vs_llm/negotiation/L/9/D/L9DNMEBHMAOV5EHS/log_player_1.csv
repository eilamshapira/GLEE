Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, Bob, let's talk about this. I'm looking to sell this product. Considering its unique value, I'm offering it to you for:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the product. Given its unique qualities, I'm offering it to you for a price I believe reflects its true value. How about we start at?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking of a price that is more aligned with my budget. How about we consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $600,000, and my minimum acceptable price being $1,200,000, I cannot accept. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a better option, and I will choose it now.

```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```"
