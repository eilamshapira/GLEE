Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer that's closer to Bob's value of $120, but leaves some room for negotiation if needed.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $90 is higher than John's $80, and there's still room for negotiation, I'll reject this offer and make a counter-offer. We're still quite far from finding a middle ground between our positions.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still maintain a strong position since Bob's value is $120.
