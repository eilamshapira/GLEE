"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think through this strategically:

1. My maximum value for the product is $120
2. John's price is $120 (my worst-case option)
3. Alice's current offer is $110
4. The product is worth $80 to Alice, so she has room to go lower

Since Alice's offer ($110) is less than my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120), it's a viable option. However, knowing that Alice's cost is $80, there's significant room for negotiation. It would be worth rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product costs Alice $80 and she offered $110, I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to the middle ground. I want to leave some room for negotiation while still making a reasonable offer that Alice might accept.

{""product_price"": 90}

This offer is $10 above Alice's cost and $30 below her initial offer. It's a significant reduction from her asking price but still gives her a decent profit margin, which might make it acceptable to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $110 to $100, showing willingness to negotiate
2. This represents a $20 profit for her over her cost ($80)
3. The price is $20 less than John's alternative ($120)
4. We've seen movement in the negotiation from $110 → $90 (my offer) → $100

This is actually a pretty good offer. While we might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk that:
1. Alice might not go much lower
2. Continuing to negotiate might lead to Alice becoming less flexible
3. We might end up having to go with John's higher price ($120)

Given that $100 is a significant improvement from the initial offer and represents a good savings compared to John's price, I'll accept this offer.
