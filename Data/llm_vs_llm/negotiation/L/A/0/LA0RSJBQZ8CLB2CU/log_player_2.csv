"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offer is $1,100,000
2. My maximum value is $1,200,000
3. John's fixed price is $1,200,000
4. The product is worth $800,000 to Alice

Alice's offer is lower than John's price by $100,000, but there's still room for negotiation since Alice's cost is $800,000. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This could lead to a better price, and I still have John's offer as a backup if negotiations fail.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Let me make a strategic counteroffer:

Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, and she offered $1,100,000, I'll propose a price that's still profitable for her but significantly better for me. I'll start with a price that splits the difference between her cost ($800,000) and her initial offer ($1,100,000), with a slight bias towards my side.

{""product_price"": 900000}

This offer:
1. Gives Alice a $100,000 profit over her cost
2. Is significantly lower than both her initial offer and John's price
3. Leaves room for negotiation if she counters
4. Is a reasonable starting point that isn't insultingly low"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a good development in the negotiation:

1. Alice has dropped her price from $1,100,000 to $1,000,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. This price is $200,000 less than John's fixed price
3. Alice still has a healthy $200,000 profit margin from her cost ($800,000)
4. We've made significant progress from the initial offer

While there might still be some room for negotiation, this is a good price that:
- Saves me $200,000 compared to John's offer
- Shows substantial movement from Alice's initial position
- Represents a fair middle ground

Given that we still have to reach a deal within a limited number of rounds, and this is a good price, I'll accept this offer.
