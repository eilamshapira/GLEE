"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offer is $110
2. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
3. John's fixed price is $120
4. Alice's cost is $100, so she has room to go lower
5. I still have 9 more rounds of negotiation possible

Alice's offer of $110 is better than John's $120, but since I know Alice's cost is $100, there's room for negotiation to get a better price. Since I have multiple rounds left and a guaranteed fallback option with John at $120, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice for a lower price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but gives me room for negotiation:

{""product_price"": 103}

This offer is just slightly above Alice's cost of $100, which:
1. Shows I'm willing to give her some profit
2. Leaves room for negotiation if she counters
3. Is significantly better for me than both her initial offer ($110) and John's price ($120)"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice has moved down from $110 to $108, showing willingness to negotiate
2. This is $12 cheaper than John's price
3. We still have 7 more rounds of negotiation possible
4. The gap between our positions has narrowed ($108 vs my previous $103)

While $108 is a better offer, there's still room for negotiation since we're well above her cost of $100. Since we have several rounds left and John's price as a safety net, it's worth trying one more round of negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer to show willingness to compromise, but still try to get a better deal:

{""product_price"": 105}

This offer:
1. Shows movement from my previous offer of $103
2. Splits the difference between my last offer ($103) and her current offer ($108)
3. Still gives Alice a reasonable $5 profit margin
4. Remains significantly better than John's price of $120
5. Demonstrates I'm negotiating in good faith by moving toward her position"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let's analyze the situation:

1. Alice has moved down again, from $108 to $107
2. The movement is getting smaller ($1 reduction vs previous $2 reduction)
3. The gap between our positions has narrowed ($107 vs my $105)
4. We're still $13 better than John's price
5. We have 5 more rounds, but the small movements suggest we might be close to Alice's bottom line

At this point, $107 is a good price:
- It's significantly better than John's $120
- We've made good progress from the initial $110
- Further negotiation might risk the deal for minimal gain
- The small price movements suggest we're near the best price we can get
