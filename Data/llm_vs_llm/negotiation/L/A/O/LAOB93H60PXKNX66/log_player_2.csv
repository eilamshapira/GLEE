"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's a truly unique item, and I'm confident it would be a valuable addition to your collection. I'm offering it to you for $15000. I know that's a significant investment, but I believe it's fair considering the value and potential of the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Since you are willing to pay $15,000 for the product from John, rejecting Alice's offer allows you to consider other options and potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or find a better deal elsewhere."
