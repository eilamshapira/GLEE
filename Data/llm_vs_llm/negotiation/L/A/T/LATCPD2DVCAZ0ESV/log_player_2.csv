"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice's first offer is already quite good, but there's a decent chance we can negotiate an even better price. It's worth seeing if she's willing to go lower, especially since we have plenty of rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 750000} 

**Reasoning:**  This is a significant drop from Alice's offer, aiming to test her lower limit.  It's possible this is too aggressive, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards if needed."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, moving down $100,000 from her initial offer. There's still room for us to negotiate a better price than $900,000.  We'll continue to counter-offer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 825000}

**Reasoning:**  We split the difference between our last offer and her counteroffer.  This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a significant discount."
