(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000 is close to my maximum budget of $1,500,000, but I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, I believe there's room for negotiation to get a better deal.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's initial offer and the product's value to her, I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than her initial price but still reasonable, aiming to save as much money as possible.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,350,000 is a step in the right direction, but I still believe I can get a better deal since the product is worth $1,200,000 to her. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has already come down from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000, I'll meet her halfway between her last offer and the product's value to her, which is $1,200,000 + ($1,350,000 - $1,200,000)/2 = $1,275,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,312,500 is getting closer to what I consider a fair price, but I still think I can negotiate a bit more. Since we're halfway through the rounds, I'll try to make a more strategic counteroffer to see if Alice will budge further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's last offer was $1,312,500, I'll try to split the difference again between her offer and the product's value to her ($1,200,000), aiming for a price that's slightly above the midpoint. The midpoint would be ($1,312,500 + $1,200,000)/2 = $1,256,250. I'll offer slightly above this, at $1,260,000, to show I'm willing to compromise but still looking for the best deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,286,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,286,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's offer of $1,286,250 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $1,260,000, and it's clear that she's trying to meet me halfway. Given that we're running out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy from Alice at a lower price than John's offer, I'll consider accepting this offer. However, since I've come this far, I'll think about making one final strategic move.

But considering the time and the fact that $1,286,250 is a good price, I think it's time to make a decision to either accept or reject and potentially buy from John.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice's last offer was $1,286,250, and considering we're near the end of the negotiation rounds, I'll make a final attempt to get an even better deal. I'll offer $1,275,000, which is slightly below Alice's last offer but still above the product's value to her. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to meet her closer to the middle but also indicates that I'm serious about getting the best possible price.
