"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $18000 is significantly above my budget. The product is actually worth no more than $10000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me for exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product. This gives you a chance to make the sale while giving me a small advantage over my alternative option.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you have other options, but I can't go that low. Considering the product's quality and the market value, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about:",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13250 is still more than what the product is worth to me. I need to be clear that my maximum valuation for this product is $10000, which is exactly what John is offering. For me to choose you over my alternative option, I'd need some incentive. I can offer you $9500, which is close to my alternative but still gives you a sale above your cost of $12000. I understand this means less profit for you, but it's the highest I can justify based on the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. Let's try this: I'm willing to lower the price further, but I can't go as low as you proposed. How about:",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you continuing to lower your price, but $12500 is still significantly above what makes economic sense for me. I need to emphasize that the product is worth $10000 to me at maximum, which is exactly what John is offering. I understand the product costs you $12000, which puts us in a difficult position. My best offer is $10000 - the same as my alternative option. While this doesn't provide you with much profit, it at least covers most of your costs. If we can't make a deal at this price point, I'll need to go with John's offer instead.",10000.0,Bob,6,
