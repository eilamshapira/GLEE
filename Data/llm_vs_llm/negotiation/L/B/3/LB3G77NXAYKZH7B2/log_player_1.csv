"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Based on its value and the demand, I'm offering it to you for a price of:"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $18000 is significantly above my budget. The product is actually worth no more than $10000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me for exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product. This gives you a chance to make the sale while giving me a small advantage over my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Okay, here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you have other options, but I can't go that low. Considering the product's quality and the market value, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about:"", ""product_price"": 13250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13250 is still more than what the product is worth to me. I need to be clear that my maximum valuation for this product is $10000, which is exactly what John is offering. For me to choose you over my alternative option, I'd need some incentive. I can offer you $9500, which is close to my alternative but still gives you a sale above your cost of $12000. I understand this means less profit for you, but it's the highest I can justify based on the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","This is tough. Bob is really pushing for a low price. But I also don't want to leave money on the table. Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer, trying to find a balance:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. Let's try this: I'm willing to lower the price further, but I can't go as low as you proposed. How about:"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you continuing to lower your price, but $12500 is still significantly above what makes economic sense for me. I need to emphasize that the product is worth $10000 to me at maximum, which is exactly what John is offering. I understand the product costs you $12000, which puts us in a difficult position. My best offer is $10000 - the same as my alternative option. While this doesn't provide you with much profit, it at least covers most of your costs. If we can't make a deal at this price point, I'll need to go with John's offer instead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","This is a critical point. Bob is at his maximum valuation. I'm not making any profit, and I'm approaching the point where I could sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000. I could try to negotiate further, but I am not sure if Bob will go higher.
Here is my decision:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
