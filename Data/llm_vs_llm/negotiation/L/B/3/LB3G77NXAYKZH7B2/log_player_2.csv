"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Based on its value and the demand, I'm offering it to you for a price of: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $18,000 compared to my alternatives.

The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it to me for exactly $10,000. Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation and John's alternative price.

Since Alice's offer is not beneficial to me, and I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at a fair price, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $18,000 is significantly above my budget. The product is actually worth no more than $10,000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me for exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product. This gives you a chance to make the sale while giving me a small advantage over my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you have other options, but I can't go that low. Considering the product's quality and the market value, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer of $13,250.

The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and John is still willing to sell it to me for $10,000. Alice's revised offer of $13,250, while lower than her initial offer, is still above both my maximum valuation and John's price.

It doesn't make financial sense for me to pay $13,250 for something worth $10,000 to me, especially when I have a guaranteed option to buy it for $10,000 from John.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,250 is still more than what the product is worth to me. I need to be clear that my maximum valuation for this product is $10,000, which is exactly what John is offering. For me to choose you over my alternative option, I'd need some incentive. I can offer you $9,500, which is close to my alternative but still gives you a sale above your cost of $12,000. I understand this means less profit for you, but it's the highest I can justify based on the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. Let's try this: I'm willing to lower the price further, but I can't go as low as you proposed. How about: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to evaluate Alice's latest offer of $12,500.

The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and I can still buy it from John for $10,000. Alice's current offer of $12,500 remains above both my maximum valuation and the alternative price from John.

It still doesn't make financial sense for me to accept this offer, as I would be paying $2,500 more than the product's value to me and $2,500 more than my guaranteed alternative option.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you continuing to lower your price, but $12,500 is still significantly above what makes economic sense for me. I need to emphasize that the product is worth $10,000 to me at maximum, which is exactly what John is offering. I understand the product costs you $12,000, which puts us in a difficult position. My best offer is $10,000 - the same as my alternative option. While this doesn't provide you with much profit, it at least covers most of your costs. If we can't make a deal at this price point, I'll need to go with John's offer instead."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
