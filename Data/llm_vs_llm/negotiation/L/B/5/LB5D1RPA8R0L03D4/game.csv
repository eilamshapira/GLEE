"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but $5000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'd like to make a counteroffer that still reflects the product's value but is more considerate of your budget.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the reduction, but $18000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. Let's discuss further.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued interest in the product, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet halfway. However, $7000 is still below my target price. Considering your previous offer and my last counteroffer, I'd like to propose a price that's slightly lower than my previous offer but still reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price, Alice. However, $16000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I need to stay within a reasonable range. Let's try to bridge the gap.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your increased offer, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $8000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'd like to make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one, but still reflects the product's value. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I do have another buyer interested in the product at a higher price, so I need to balance our negotiation with that option.",15000.0,Alice,7,
