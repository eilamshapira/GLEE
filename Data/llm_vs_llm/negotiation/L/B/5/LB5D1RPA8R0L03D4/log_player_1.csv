Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $5,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and the minimum value I have for the product. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but $5,000 is too low for me.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the reduction, but $18000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. Let's discuss further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I appreciate Bob's willingness to meet halfway, but $7,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Since I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, I'd like to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a price closer to my initial offer or at least above $15,000. I'll make another counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer of $8,000 is still significantly lower than my target price, and I believe I can get a better deal. Since I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, which is almost twice Bob's current offer, I'd like to continue negotiating with Bob to see if he's willing to increase his offer further.

If not, I do have another buyer interested in the product at a higher price, so I need to balance our negotiation with that option."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
