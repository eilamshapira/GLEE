Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a somewhat high offer to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Given that Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and John's guaranteed offer ($1,500,000), I'll reject this offer. Since I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, there's no reason to accept anything lower than that.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial offer but still keep it above John's guaranteed price of $1,500,000, as there's no reason to go below that.

{""product_price"": 1,700,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. Since I can sell to John for $1,500,000 at any time, and Bob's offers are not approaching this value quickly enough, it makes the most sense to end the negotiation and take John's guaranteed offer.
