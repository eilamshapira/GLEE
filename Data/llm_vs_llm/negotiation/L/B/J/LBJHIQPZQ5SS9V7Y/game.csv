"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2300000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe $2300000 is above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase this product, but I need a more reasonable price. I'd like to propose $600000 as a starting point for further discussion.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2300000 represents the high end of the product's value range, I understand your perspective on the budget.  To move forward, I can come down to $1900000. This reflects a significant adjustment on my end and still recognizes the product's worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for revising your offer. I appreciate the significant adjustment you've made. However, $1900000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'd like to propose $1250000 as the next step in our negotiation.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation. I see we are making progress. While $1250000 is closer to where we need to be, I can't accept a price that low at this time. Let's settle this right now.  To demonstrate my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to accept $1700000. This is my final offer.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
