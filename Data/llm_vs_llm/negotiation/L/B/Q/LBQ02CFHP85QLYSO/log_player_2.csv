Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I should definitely not accept Alice's offer of $175, as it's more than the product is worth to me ($120) and more than I'd pay to John ($120).

Therefore, I will choose to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, I need to make a counteroffer. My goal is to get the price as low as possible, but I also don't want to lose the deal entirely. Given the constraints, I should try to get the price as close to $120 as possible. I'll start with something a little lower than my ""walk away"" price, to see if I can get a better deal.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, Alice rejected my previous offer. It seems she is not willing to negotiate from her initial offer that much. I will make a counteroffer and push for a price close to $120, so I can still get the best deal.
