"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $150. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer is much higher than your maximum price and what John offers. It makes the most sense to buy from John for $80."
