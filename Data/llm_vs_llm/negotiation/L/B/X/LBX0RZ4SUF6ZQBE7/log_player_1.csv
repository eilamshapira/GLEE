"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I believe the price is a bit high for my budget. I would like to make a counteroffer of $750000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my initial offer and also lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a more reasonable offer from Bob. I'll proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you have a budget in mind, but I still believe the product is worth more than $750,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1375000 is still beyond my budget. How about we settle at $900000 for the product?

I reject Bob's offer of $900,000 because it's still lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $1,200,000. Although Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, I believe I can get a better offer from him or stick to my backup option of selling to John for $1,200,000. I'll proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer, trying to meet Bob somewhere in between while still aiming to get as close to my initial valuation as possible."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid to $900,000.

Round 6

I reject Bob's offer of $850,000 because it's still significantly lower than my target price and the minimum value I have for the product, which is $1,200,000. Although Bob has increased his offer again, it doesn't meet my expectations. I'm starting to consider that selling to John for $1,200,000 might be the better option, but I'll give Bob one more chance to meet me at a more reasonable price. I'll proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer, trying to nudge Bob closer to my desired price."

I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your increased offer of $850,000.
