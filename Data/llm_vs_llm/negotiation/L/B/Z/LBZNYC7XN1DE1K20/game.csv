"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $150?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle at $150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $120, which is the highest I can go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options. Can you sell it to me for $120?",120.0,Bob,4,
