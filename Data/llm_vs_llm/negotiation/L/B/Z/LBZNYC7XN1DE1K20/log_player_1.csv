"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, considering Bob's offer of $100 and John's offer of $120, I need to make a decision. Since my minimum value is $120, I should not sell the product for less than that.

Therefore:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer for Round 3:

{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $150?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle at $150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $120, which is the highest I can go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options. Can you sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","This is a crucial round. Bob's offer of $120 matches John's offer. I have two choices that lead to the same monetary outcome, but I'll consider a few factors:

*   **Risk vs. Reward:** If I sell to Bob, I get the deal done now.
*   **Information:** I don't know how valuable the product is to Bob, so he might be willing to pay more.

Given these considerations, I will make the following decision:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
