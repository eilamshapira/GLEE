"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. If you're interested, please consider my offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Looking at Alice's offer of $150 for the product, I need to consider my options carefully.

The product is worth no more than $120 to me, according to my information. John is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $120.

Since Alice's offer of $150 exceeds both my maximum valuation ($120) and John's alternative price ($120), it makes financial sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John instead.
