"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Based on the information provided:

1. The product is worth no more than $80 to me (Bob).
2. Alice is offering it for $200.
3. John is willing to sell it for $80.

Since Alice's offer ($200) is significantly higher than both the value to me ($80) and John's price ($80), it makes the most sense to purchase from John.
