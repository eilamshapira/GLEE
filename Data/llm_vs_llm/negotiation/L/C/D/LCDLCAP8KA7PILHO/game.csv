"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am considering options that align more with my budget. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product for $9000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10500.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and a fair price for the value you'll receive. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my budget constraints. I understand the value of your product, but I'm ready to make a purchase at $9500. This allows us to meet in the middle and is a fair compromise for both parties.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9500 still doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm prepared to meet you halfway at $10000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal now.",10000.0,Alice,5,
