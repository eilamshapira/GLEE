"Bob, I'm excited you're interested in this unique opportunity. I believe this product holds immense potential value for you. Given its rarity and the significant returns it can generate, I'm offering it to you for $5000000.",5000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the potential of the product, the price you're asking is significantly higher than what I can justify. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it, considering its value to me tops out at $1500000. Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $1000000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. While I value your interest, I cannot let it go for that amount. Let's meet in the middle. How about $4000000?",4000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see that we're still quite far apart on the price. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more, but I can't go beyond my limit. How about we settle at $1250000? This is a significant increase from my last offer and reflects my strong interest in the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. We are getting closer, but we're still quite a ways apart. My absolute bottom line is $3500000. It is a unique opportunity.",3500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $3500000 is still well above what I can justify spending. I'm prepared to go up to $1400000, which is very close to my maximum budget. This is my final offer, as I have another option available at $1500000. Please let me know if this works for you.",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I hear you that this is your final offer. I am willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go that low. My final offer is $3000000. It is a unique opportunity. Take it or leave it.",3000000.0,Alice,7,
