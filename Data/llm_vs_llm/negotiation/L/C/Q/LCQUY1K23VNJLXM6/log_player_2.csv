"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $80, Alice's offer of $200 is far too high. There's no reason for me to pay $200 when I can get the same product for $80.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $180 is still much higher than John's price of $80, and it's also higher than the maximum value of $80 that the product is worth to me. There's no reason for me to accept this offer.
