Send your offer to Bob.,"After careful consideration, I need to decide on an optimal pricing strategy. 

Since the product is worth at least $12,000 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price, I should offer Bob a higher price to try to maximize my profit.

Bob might value the product higher than $12,000, so I should aim for a reasonable premium over my floor price. If I price it too high, Bob might reject the offer, but that's okay since I have John as a backup buyer at $12,000.

I'll offer the product at a 25% premium over my floor price, which is a significant but not unreasonable markup.
