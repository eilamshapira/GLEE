"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. Considering that I have another buyer willing to pay $100, I need to get closer to that value. How about a counteroffer at $115? Let me know if that works for you.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $115 is still a bit high for me. Could you go down to $105? I think that's a fair compromise given the circumstances.",105.0,Bob,4,
