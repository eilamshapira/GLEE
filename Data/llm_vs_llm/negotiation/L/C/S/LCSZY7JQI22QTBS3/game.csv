,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $120 is a bit high for me. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $100. But I'd like to work with you - would you consider selling it for $85? This would save me some time looking elsewhere, and you'd still make a good profit.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $105?  It's a fair price for both of us. ",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. However, I still need a better deal since I can get it for $100 elsewhere. How about we meet in the middle at $95? This would give you a quick sale and save me a bit of money.",95.0,Bob,4,
