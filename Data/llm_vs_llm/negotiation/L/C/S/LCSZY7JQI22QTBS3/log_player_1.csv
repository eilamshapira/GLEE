Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $120 is a bit high for me. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $100. But I'd like to work with you - would you consider selling it for $85? This would save me some time looking elsewhere, and you'd still make a good profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
