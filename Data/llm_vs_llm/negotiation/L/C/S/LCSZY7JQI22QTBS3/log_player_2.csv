"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $120 is higher than both the product's worth to me ($100) and John's price ($100). It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer to Alice, since there's potential to negotiate a better price than John's $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $120 is a bit high for me. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $100. But I'd like to work with you - would you consider selling it for $85? This would save me some time looking elsewhere, and you'd still make a good profit."", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $105?  It's a fair price for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $120, her current price of $105 is still above John's price of $100. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible and I have a guaranteed option to buy at $100 from John, I should reject this offer and try one more counteroffer with Alice. If she doesn't come down below $100, I can always go with John's offer."
