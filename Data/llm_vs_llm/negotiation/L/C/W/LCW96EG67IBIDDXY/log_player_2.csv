"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $180. This is a high-quality product that I'm confident will serve your needs well. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $150 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $180, which is above my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $150, which matches my maximum value
4. Alice's initial offer is $30 higher than John's price

Since Alice's offer ($180) is above my maximum value ($150), and John is offering the exact same product at my maximum acceptable price ($150), there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice. Her opening offer is too high, and even if we negotiate down, it's unlikely to beat John's price.
