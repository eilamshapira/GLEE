"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10000.  This product is worth $8000 to you, so I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.  How about $11000? This is a compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
