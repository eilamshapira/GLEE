"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. After evaluating market conditions and the product's unique features, I'm offering it to you for $1150000. This represents a fair price considering the $1200000 value you would gain from this acquisition. I believe this creates a win-win situation where you receive $50000 in value while I receive a reasonable return on my product.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking to maximize your savings, $1050000 is lower than what I can accept given the product's market value. I'm willing to meet you part way and offer the product for $1120000. This still provides you with $80000 in value while giving me a fair return. This represents a $30000 reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to work with you toward a mutually beneficial agreement.",1120000.0,Alice,3,
