"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Looking at the options:

1. Alice is offering the product for $12,000
2. I can reject Alice's offer
3. I can buy from John for $8,000

Since the product is only worth up to $8,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $8,000, I should take John's offer. Alice's price of $12,000 exceeds my maximum value for the product.
