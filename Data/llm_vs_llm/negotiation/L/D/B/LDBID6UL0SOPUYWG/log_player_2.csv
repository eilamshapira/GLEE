You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price.  Rejecting her offer means you can negotiate with John.  While you'll likely end up paying the same price, there's always a chance for negotiation and potentially a better deal with John."
