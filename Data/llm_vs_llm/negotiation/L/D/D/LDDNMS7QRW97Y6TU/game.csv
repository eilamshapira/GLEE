"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I was thinking of a lower price. How about $4000?",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your response, Bob. However, $4000 is a bit too low for this product. How about I lower the price to $12500? I believe it reflects its true value. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! However, $5000 is still below the value I see in this product. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",11000.0,Alice,5,
