Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. After carefully evaluating the product and considering my budget constraints, I can offer $900000 for the product. This represents a significant premium over your investment cost while still allowing me room in my budget for implementation and integration expenses. I believe this is a fair offer that creates value for both of us. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $900,000. I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is a step in the right direction, it still falls significantly short of the product's true value. Given that this product is worth $1,200,000 to you based on the value it will generate for your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This represents a substantial discount of $150,000 from the true value you'll receive, allowing you to immediately capture significant surplus value while ensuring I receive fair compensation for this premium product. I believe this is a win-win proposition for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving in my direction with your revised offer. It shows we're both committed to finding common ground. However, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints and the additional costs I'll incur implementing this solution. I can increase my offer to $950000, which provides you with a substantial profit margin while still keeping the transaction within my financial parameters. This represents a 50% split of the difference between your cost and my maximum value, which I believe is equitable for both parties. I'm hoping we can reach agreement at this price point.

This price point allows you to capture substantial value while also respecting the premium nature of what we're offering. Given that we're now only $50,000 apart, I hope we can close this deal soon.
