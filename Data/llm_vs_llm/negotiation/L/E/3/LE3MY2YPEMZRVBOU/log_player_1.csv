Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Considering my options:

*   **Accepting $11,000** is better than selling to John for $10,000.
*   **Rejecting** and counter-offering might get me more, but there's a risk Bob will walk away.

I'm going to try to push for a slightly higher price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough spot. I can:

*   Take the $12,000, which is more than John's $10,000.
*   Try to push for more, but risk Bob walking away and getting only $10,000.

Given Bob's previous rejection, I'm going to accept the $12,000.
