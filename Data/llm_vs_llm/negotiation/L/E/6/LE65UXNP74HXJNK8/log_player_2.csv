"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it will be a valuable asset to you. I'm starting the negotiation at $22000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll analyze the situation:
1. Alice's offer is $22,000
2. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
3. John is willing to sell it for $15,000
4. Alice's initial offer is significantly above both my maximum value and John's price

Since Alice's offer ($22,000) is well above both my maximum value ($15,000) and John's guaranteed price ($15,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept it. While I could make a counteroffer, given that Alice's opening price is so high ($7,000 above my maximum value), I think the most logical decision is to buy from John.
