"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is quite high for my budget. Based on my market research and the product's value to me, I can offer $90. This is a fair price that would work well for me. Would you consider this offer?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is too low considering the product's quality and market value. I understand you're working within a budget, but I cannot go below $150 for this product. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would you consider this price?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. While $150 is better than the initial offer, it's still above what I can justify spending. I can increase my offer to $110, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This reflects both the product's value and my budget constraints. Would this work for you?",110.0,Bob,4,
