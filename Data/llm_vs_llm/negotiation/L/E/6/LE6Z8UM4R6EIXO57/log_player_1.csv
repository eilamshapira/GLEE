"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is quite high for my budget. Based on my market research and the product's value to me, I can offer $90. This is a fair price that would work well for me. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer because:
1. Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120
2. I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate
3. I can always fall back on John's $120 offer if needed
4. Bob's initial counteroffer showing significant room for negotiation from his side

I'll continue negotiating to try to get a better price than John's $120 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is too low considering the product's quality and market value. I understand you're working within a budget, but I cannot go below $150 for this product. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would you consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. While $150 is better than the initial offer, it's still above what I can justify spending. I can increase my offer to $110, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This reflects both the product's value and my budget constraints. Would this work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I choose to sell to John because:
1. Bob's current offer ($110) is still below John's guaranteed $120
2. The negotiation pattern suggests Bob is unlikely to exceed $120 (he moved from $90 to $110, showing resistance to higher prices)
3. Each round of negotiation carries the risk of losing time and potentially missing out on John's offer
4. The $10 difference between Bob's offer and my minimum price ($120) isn't worth the risk of continued negotiation
5. John's offer provides a guaranteed profit at my minimum acceptable price

Better to take the sure $120 from John than risk further negotiation for a potentially lower amount."
