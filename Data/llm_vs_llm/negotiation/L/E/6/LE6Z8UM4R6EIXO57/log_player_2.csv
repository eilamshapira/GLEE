"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think about this:
1. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
2. Alice's offer of $180 is significantly above my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $120, which is my maximum acceptable price
4. There's potential to negotiate with Alice for a better price, and I have 10 rounds

I'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate for a better price. If we can't reach a good deal, I can always buy from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably below my maximum price, leaving room for negotiation while still being respectful.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is quite high for my budget. Based on my market research and the product's value to me, I can offer $90. This is a fair price that would work well for me. Would you consider this offer?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is too low considering the product's quality and market value. I understand you're working within a budget, but I cannot go below $150 for this product. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would you consider this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:
1. Alice has reduced her price from $180 to $150, showing willingness to negotiate
2. However, $150 is still above my maximum value of $120
3. John's offer of $120 remains available
4. We still have several rounds to negotiate
5. Alice has moved down $30, so there might be room for further negotiation

Since $150 is still above my maximum value and higher than John's price, I'll reject and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by dropping $30 from her initial price. I'll increase my previous offer but still stay below John's price to leave room for further negotiation.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. While $150 is better than the initial offer, it's still above what I can justify spending. I can increase my offer to $110, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This reflects both the product's value and my budget constraints. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
