"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While your product seems interesting, that price is a bit too high for me. I would be willing to pay $600000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. While I appreciate your offer, I'm afraid $600000 is too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $2100000. What do you think?",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  However,  $2100000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $800000? This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the value of your product.",800000.0,Bob,4,
