"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that I know the product is worth $80 to Bob and $150 to me (my minimum acceptable price), I'll start with a high initial offer to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $60 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and even significantly below the product's value to Bob ($80), I will reject this offer. However, I know I have John's guaranteed offer of $150, so there's no reason to accept anything lower than that.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's previous offer was very low ($60), and knowing the product is worth $80 to him, I'll lower my price but still keep it well above his valuation to maintain room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer of $70 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and we're now in round 4 with limited rounds remaining. Given that I have a guaranteed offer from John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price, it's best to end the negotiation with Bob and take John's offer.
