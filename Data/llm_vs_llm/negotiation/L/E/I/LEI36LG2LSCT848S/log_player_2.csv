"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price of $15,000 is higher than both my maximum valuation ($12,000) and John's alternative offer ($12,000). It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer when I can either try to negotiate for a better price with Alice or go with John's guaranteed offer of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 10000}

I'll propose $10,000 as my counteroffer. This price is significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer of $15,000 and John's alternative of $12,000, giving room for negotiation. If Alice accepts, I'll save $2,000 compared to John's offer. If she counters with a higher price, I can still negotiate or ultimately go with John's offer of $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $12,000. This price equals John's alternative offer, and since we've already tried negotiating for a lower price (which Alice rejected), it's unlikely we'll get a better deal. There's no advantage in continuing negotiations or switching to John since the price is the same, and prolonging the negotiation might risk losing this price point."
