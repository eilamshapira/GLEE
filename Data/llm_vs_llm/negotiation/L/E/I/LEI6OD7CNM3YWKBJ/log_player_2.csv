"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my premium product to you for $14000. It's a great value and I think you'll be very satisfied with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $14,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept it. I could try negotiating with Alice by making a counteroffer, but since I already have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $12,000 (which is equal to my maximum value), the best decision is to buy from John.
