(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","I'll reject Bob's offer of $60 since it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and also below John's guaranteed offer. However, I'll continue negotiating with Bob since there's potential to get a better price than John's $100.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer of $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100 and below John's guaranteed offer. Since Bob has increased his offer from $60 to $75, there's a chance he might continue increasing it, but I still have John's $100 offer as a safety net.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offers are increasing slowly ($60 → $75 → $80), but they're still below John's guaranteed $100 offer. With only 4 rounds remaining and the slow rate of increase in Bob's offers, it's becoming risky to continue negotiating. At this point, it's safer to take John's guaranteed offer.
