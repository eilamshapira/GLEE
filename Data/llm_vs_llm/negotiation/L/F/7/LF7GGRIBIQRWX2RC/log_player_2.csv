"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","The product is worth no more than $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $150. This is way too high. I'm not going to pay that much. I also don't want to waste time if Alice is not willing to negotiate reasonably. However, it's only the first round, so I'll try to negotiate.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I want to start with a reasonable offer that is still advantageous for me, given my valuation of $80. I'll offer a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still high enough that she might consider it.

```json
{""product_price"": 50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $150 to $100. This suggests she might be willing to negotiate further. However, $100 is still above my maximum value of $80. I will reject this offer and make another counteroffer, hoping she'll come down further. Buying from John is still an option if things don't improve.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice came down from $150 to $100. I offered $50 and she rejected it. Now I will offer $65, closer to my ideal price point, to see if we can find some common ground.

```json
{""product_price"": 65}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice is slowly coming down in price, but $90 is still more than I want to pay, given that I value the item at $80. However, the gap is closing. I'm going to stick to my valuation of $80. Since I can buy from John for $80, I'll make one more counteroffer closer to that price to see if Alice will bite, or else I'll just buy from John.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I will offer $75. It's close to my maximum value, and hopefully, Alice will accept it, rather than risk losing the sale.

```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice is now offering the product for $85. This is still more than I'm willing to pay, as I value it at $80. I also have the option to buy it from John for $80. Since she's so close, I'll make one final counteroffer at my maximum price. If she rejects it, I'll just buy from John.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, I'm going to offer my absolute maximum price, which is also the price John is offering.

{""product_price"": 80}
```"
