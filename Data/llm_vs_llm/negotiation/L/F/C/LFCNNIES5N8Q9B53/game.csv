"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $60 is too low for this product. Given its quality and value, I cannot go below $110. This is already a reduction from my initial offer. Would you consider this price?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but $110 is still above what I'm willing to spend. How about we settle on $70? This way, it's a fair deal for both of us.",70.0,Bob,4,
