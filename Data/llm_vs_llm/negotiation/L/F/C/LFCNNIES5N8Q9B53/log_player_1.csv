"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $120. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $60 is too low as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $60 is too low for this product. Given its quality and value, I cannot go below $110. This is already a reduction from my initial offer. Would you consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but $110 is still above what I'm willing to spend. How about we settle on $70? This way, it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $100. Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and since the product is only worth $80 to him, it's unlikely he'll make an offer that meets my minimum. The guaranteed $100 from John is the best option."
