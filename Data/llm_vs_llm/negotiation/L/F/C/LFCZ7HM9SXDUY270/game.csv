"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a great deal for you.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $130. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking of meeting in the middle between your new offer and my previous one. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  $115 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $125? This is a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
