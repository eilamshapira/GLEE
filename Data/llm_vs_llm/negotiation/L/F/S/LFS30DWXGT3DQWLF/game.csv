"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a lower price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your counteroffer, but $6000 is too low for me. How about we settle on $12000 for the product?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down from $15000, but $12000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your new price. Let's try $9000.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, $9000 is still below my acceptable range. How about I offer the product to you for $11000?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I see you're willing to come down a bit more. I appreciate that. However, $11000 is still above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's as high as I'm comfortable going. Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,6,
