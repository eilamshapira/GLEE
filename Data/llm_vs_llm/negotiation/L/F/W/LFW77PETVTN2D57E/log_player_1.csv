Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what price to offer Bob that will maximize my earnings while acknowledging that if he rejects my offer, I still have John's $10,000 as a backup.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I should set a price that gives me a reasonable chance of earning more than my guaranteed $10,000 from John. If I price too high, Bob might reject the offer, but that's okay because I have John's offer as a safety net.

I'll offer a price that represents a significant premium over my guaranteed $10,000, but not so high that it would be immediately rejected by most buyers.
