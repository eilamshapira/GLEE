Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed fallback of $1,200,000 from John
3. Bob might be willing to pay more than $1,200,000 to secure the product
4. However, if I ask for too much, Bob will reject the offer

Given these factors, I'll offer a price slightly above my minimum acceptable price, but not so high that Bob would immediately reject it.
