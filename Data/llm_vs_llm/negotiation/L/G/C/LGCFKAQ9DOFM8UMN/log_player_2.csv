"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Here's my decision-making process:

*   **Alice's offer is too high:** $150 is far above my $80 limit.
*   **Buying from John is an option:** $80 is a good price.
*   **Consideration of the round:** This is round 1, and I have 9 more rounds. I can risk rejecting this offer to see if Alice will lower the price.

**Decision:** {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, I will send my counteroffer to Alice. I want to pay as little as possible, but I also don't want to make an offer that's so low Alice immediately rejects it. Since it is the first round, I will start low, but slightly above the ""buy from John"" price, to give Alice a chance to negotiate.

**Counteroffer:** {""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Okay, let's analyze:

*   **Alice's new offer:** $140 is still too high.
*   **Buying from John:** Still a viable, good option at $80.
*   **Negotiation time:** We are in round 3. Still got time to negotiate.

**Decision:** {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alright, it's round 4. Alice still hasn't come down enough. I'll make a counteroffer, and I'll be slightly more aggressive this time, but still a little above the ""buy from John"" price, to test how Alice reacts.

**Counteroffer:** {""product_price"": 82}"
