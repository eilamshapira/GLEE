"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, considering my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer $500000 for the product. I believe this can be a fair deal for both of us. Looking forward to your response.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $500000 is significantly below the value of this item, as it's worth at least $1000000 to me. John has already offered me $1000000 for it, but I'm giving you priority because I believe this product could be particularly valuable for you. I can come down to $1500000, which I think is fair considering the product's quality and market value. What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you, Alice. I understand the product's value to you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, my budget is still a constraint. I can increase my offer to $600000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise given my financial limits. Please let me know if we can reach an agreement on this.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and understand your budget constraints. However, I need to emphasize that I already have a guaranteed offer from John for $1000000. Given that I know you're interested in this product, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000, which is a further reduction from my previous offer. This price still reflects the true value of the product while giving you priority over other potential buyers. Please consider that I cannot go below $1000000 as that would be less than what I can get elsewhere.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. I truly value this product, but I do have financial limits to consider. I'm able to offer $700000. I hope we can find a middle ground where the deal benefits us both. I appreciate your patience and understanding.",700000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the increase in your offer. However, I must be straightforward - I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $1000000. I've been negotiating with you because I believe this product could be particularly valuable for you, but I cannot accept less than what John is offering. My final offer to you is $1100000. This is only $100000 above John's offer, which I think is quite reasonable given the product's value. If we cannot reach an agreement at this price point, I will need to proceed with John's offer. Thank you for understanding.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
