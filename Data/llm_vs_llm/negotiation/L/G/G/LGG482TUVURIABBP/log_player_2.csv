Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $500000 is significantly below the value of this item, as it's worth at least $1000000 to me. John has already offered me $1000000 for it, but I'm giving you priority because I believe this product could be particularly valuable for you. I can come down to $1500000, which I think is fair considering the product's quality and market value. What do you say?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and understand your budget constraints. However, I need to emphasize that I already have a guaranteed offer from John for $1000000. Given that I know you're interested in this product, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000, which is a further reduction from my previous offer. This price still reflects the true value of the product while giving you priority over other potential buyers. Please consider that I cannot go below $1000000 as that would be less than what I can get elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the increase in your offer. However, I must be straightforward - I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $1000000. I've been negotiating with you because I believe this product could be particularly valuable for you, but I cannot accept less than what John is offering. My final offer to you is $1100000. This is only $100000 above John's offer, which I think is quite reasonable given the product's value. If we cannot reach an agreement at this price point, I will need to proceed with John's offer. Thank you for understanding.
