"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $170. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $170 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering my needs and budget.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140?  I'm confident you'll find it's worth that price.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $90. I think this is a fair price, considering we're both trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However, I can't go as low as $90.  My final offer is $120.  This is my absolute lowest price, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's value.",120.0,Alice,5,
