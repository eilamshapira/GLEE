Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to think carefully about my negotiation strategy. The product is worth at least $8,000 to me, and it's worth $8,000 to Bob. I already have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so I should aim to get more than that from Bob if possible.

I'll start with a price above $8,000 to give myself room to negotiate down if needed, while still potentially making more than my guaranteed alternative.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","I need to consider my options carefully here.

Bob has offered $7,500, which is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. Since I already have John willing to pay $8,000, accepting Bob's offer would mean losing $500 unnecessarily.

I could either:
1) Reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, trying to get him to pay more than $8,000
2) Simply sell to John immediately at the guaranteed $8,000

Since I have nothing to lose by continuing negotiations with Bob (I can always sell to John later), I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer, but I need to stay above $8,000 since that's my guaranteed alternative with John.
