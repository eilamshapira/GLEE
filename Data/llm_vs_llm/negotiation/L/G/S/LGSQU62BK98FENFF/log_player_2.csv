"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The offer of $9,500 from Alice is actually higher than the $8,000 that the product is worth to me, and it's also higher than John's price of $8,000. 

Since I can get the exact same product from John for $8,000, and this matches the maximum value I place on the product, I should not accept Alice's higher offer.
