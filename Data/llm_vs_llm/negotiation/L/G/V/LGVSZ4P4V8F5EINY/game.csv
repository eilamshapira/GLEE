"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must say that $10000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's value and its demand, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $14000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice. But I think $14000 is still a bit high. Can we settle for $11000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current one. I can offer the product to you for $12500. I think this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,
