"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a high initial offer to test Bob's willingness to pay and leave room for negotiation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","I will reject Bob's offer of $500,000 because it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and even below John's guaranteed offer. There's no reason to accept an offer that's half of what I can definitely get from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's initial offer was quite low at $500,000, but he's still showing interest in negotiating, I'll reduce my price somewhat from my initial offer but still maintain a strong position well above my minimum price.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","I will reject Bob's offer of $700,000 because it's still significantly below John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000. Bob's offers are increasing but still not competitive with what I can get from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I notice Bob is making incremental increases in his offers ($500K to $700K). While I'm willing to come down somewhat from my previous offer to show good faith in negotiating, I still need to stay well above my $1M floor price from John.

{""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is still below John's guaranteed price of $1,000,000. While Bob continues to increase his offers, we're running out of rounds and he's still not matching what I can get from John. There's no reason to accept less than my guaranteed alternative.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Given that Bob's last offer was $850,000 and we're in round 7 of 10, I'll lower my price further but still maintain a premium above my guaranteed $1M from John. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but won't go below my alternative option.
