"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer ($2,000,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. It would never make sense to accept a price that's higher than my maximum value or John's alternative price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 500000}

I'll start with a relatively low counteroffer of $500,000, which is half of John's price. This gives room for negotiation while potentially saving money compared to John's option. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground that's still below John's price of $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,750,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000). While she did reduce the price from her initial offer, it's still not competitive with John's alternative. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, trying to reach a price below John's $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'll increase my previous offer to $700,000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer of $500,000, showing willingness to negotiate, but still provides substantial savings compared to John's price of $1,000,000. This gives Alice room to continue negotiating while keeping the price below my maximum value and John's alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is still significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000). While Alice continues to lower her price, she's still not offering a competitive price compared to John's alternative. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. If Alice doesn't start moving closer to $1,000,000 soon, I may need to consider taking John's offer as we're already halfway through our negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 850000}

I'll increase my offer to $850,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer of $700,000, demonstrating continued good faith in negotiations. This price would still save $150,000 compared to John's alternative while being closer to a middle ground. With only a few rounds remaining, I'm making a more aggressive move towards a reasonable compromise, while still maintaining room for potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's current offer ($1,300,000) is still significantly above John's price ($1,000,000)
2. We've had several rounds of negotiation, and Alice's price reductions are not moving quickly enough toward a competitive price
3. With only a few rounds remaining, and given Alice's pattern of high counteroffers, it seems unlikely we'll reach a price below John's $1,000,000
4. John's price is already at my maximum value, and we're guaranteed to get it
5. Continuing negotiations carries the risk of running out of rounds and potentially having to accept a worse deal

Therefore, it's most prudent to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 now."
