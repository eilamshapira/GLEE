Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I believe a fair price would be $8000, considering the market value and my needs.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget concerns, but $8,000 is below what I can accept for this item. The product has a minimum value of $10,000 to me, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $15,000, which is still a good value considering the quality and features of this product. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $15000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. Considering you mentioned another buyer is willing to pay $10000, I'd like to meet you in the middle between my previous offer and that amount. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and negotiation. While $9,000 is getting closer, it still falls below my minimum acceptable price. Since I already have an offer for $10,000 from another buyer, I can't go below that amount. However, I'd prefer to sell to you if possible, so I can offer you the product for $12,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents excellent value for such a quality product. Can we make a deal at this price?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
