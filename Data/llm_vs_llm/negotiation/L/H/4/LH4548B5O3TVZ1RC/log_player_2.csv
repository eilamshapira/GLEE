Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget concerns, but $8000 is below what I can accept for this item. The product has a minimum value of $10000 to me, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $15000, which is still a good value considering the quality and features of this product. How does that sound?

I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and negotiation. While $9000 is getting closer, it still falls below my minimum acceptable price. Since I already have an offer for $10000 from another buyer, I can't go below that amount. However, I'd prefer to sell to you if possible, so I can offer you the product for $12500. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents excellent value for such a quality product. Can we make a deal at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
