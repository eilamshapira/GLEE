"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Considering its great value, I believe a fair price would be $12000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is lower than John's price of $15,000. Since this product is worth up to $15,000 to me, Alice's offer is already saving me $3,000. However, I could try to negotiate for an even better price by making a counteroffer in the next round.

Let me reject Alice's offer and see if I can get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. I'd be comfortable purchasing it for $9,000. This would help me meet my budget constraints while still giving you a fair sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest. Considering the product's quality and value, how about we meet in the middle at $10500? I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has countered with $10,500, which is a $1,500 reduction from her initial offer of $12,000. This is $4,500 less than John's price of $15,000, so it's definitely a good deal compared to the alternative. However, there may still be room to negotiate for a slightly better price.

Let me accept Alice's offer since it's already a good discount from my maximum budget of $15,000, and we've made good progress in the negotiation.
