Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I certainly can't go as low as $60, but I'm willing to work with you to find a price that suits us both. Would you consider $110?

I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, so I'm willing to come down a little. How about $110? This way, we both give a little and get a good deal. What do you think?"

I appreciate your efforts to negotiate, Bob, but I think it's best if I sell to John at this point. I wish you all the best!"
