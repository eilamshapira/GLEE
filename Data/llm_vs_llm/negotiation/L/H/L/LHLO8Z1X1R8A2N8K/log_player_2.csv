"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and John is willing to sell it for $150, I would never accept an offer higher than $150. Alice's offer of $200 is well above my maximum value, so I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 120}

I'll offer $120, which is below both my maximum value ($150) and John's price ($150). This gives room for negotiation while potentially saving money compared to buying from John. Since the product is worth $150 to Alice, there's a chance she might consider a price above her cost but below John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $180 because it's still above my maximum value of $150, and I can always buy from John for $150. Alice has lowered her price from $200 to $180, which shows she's willing to negotiate. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 130}

I'll increase my offer slightly to $130. This shows I'm willing to move up from my previous offer of $120, but still maintains a good margin below both my maximum value and John's price of $150. Since Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing her price, this counteroffer demonstrates good faith while still trying to secure a better deal than John's option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $165 because it's still above my maximum value of $150, and I can still get it from John for $150. Alice continues to lower her price ($200 → $180 → $165), showing she's willing to negotiate further. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, but if we can't reach a deal below $150, I'll eventually buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 140}

I'll increase my offer to $140. This is closer to both John's price and Alice's cost ($150), while still giving me some savings compared to my alternatives. Alice has shown consistent willingness to reduce her price, so offering $140 signals that I'm seriously negotiating while still maintaining the potential for savings. If Alice doesn't accept a price at or below $150 soon, I'll need to consider switching to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Alice's latest offer of $155 is still above both my maximum value and John's price of $150. While Alice has been steadily lowering her price, she seems reluctant to go below $155. Since we've already gone through 7 rounds and Alice hasn't matched or beaten John's price, it's best to take the guaranteed $150 offer from John rather than risk more rounds of negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome."
