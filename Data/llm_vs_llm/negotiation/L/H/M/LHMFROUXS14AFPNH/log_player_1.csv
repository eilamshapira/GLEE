"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","$50 is way too low - it's less than half of my minimum acceptable price of $120. Since I can sell to John for $120, there's no reason to accept such a low offer. I'll reject and make a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial $180, but still maintain a good margin above my minimum of $120.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob has only increased his offer by $10 (from $50 to $60), which is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Since I'm guaranteed $120 from John, and Bob doesn't seem to be making significant increases in his offers, it might be best to end the negotiation and take the guaranteed sale.
