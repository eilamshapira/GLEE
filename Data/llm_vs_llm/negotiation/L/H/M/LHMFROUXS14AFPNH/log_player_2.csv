"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Let's see what happens when we try to negotiate. Alice's starting price is much higher than what John is offering, so it makes sense to try and counteroffer.)

What price would you like to counteroffer to Alice?"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 50}

(Since the maximum I'm willing to pay is $80 and John is already offering that, I'll start with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate significantly.)"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Alice's offer is still much higher than what John is offering. Let's continue negotiating.)

What price would you like to counteroffer to Alice?"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 60}

(I'll increase my offer slightly to see if Alice is willing to meet in the middle. However, I'll still keep it below John's offer to ensure I'm getting a better deal.)"
