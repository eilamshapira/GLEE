"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is quite steep for this product. I've done some market research, and similar products are available for much less. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know if this works for you.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $175. Let's meet in the middle.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. However, $175 is still more than I can justify spending. I could go up to $110, which I believe is a fair price for this product. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $110 is still too far below what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $140. It's a fair price, considering the value of the product.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for working with me on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be transparent - I can get this product from another seller for $120, and that's really my maximum budget. To make it worth both our while, I could offer you $115, which would save me a little money and still give you a sale. Would that work for you?",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still too low.  I'm willing to drop down to $130. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. Let's settle this now.",130.0,Alice,7,
