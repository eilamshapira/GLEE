Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is quite steep for this product. I've done some market research, and similar products are available for much less. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. However, $175 is still more than I can justify spending. I could go up to $110, which I believe is a fair price for this product. What do you think?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for working with me on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be transparent - I can get this product from another seller for $120, and that's really my maximum budget. To make it worth both our while, I could offer you $115, which would save me a little money and still give you a sale. Would that work for you?
