"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $120
2. Alice's offer is $200, which is significantly above my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $120
4. I can try to negotiate with Alice, but her initial offer is quite high
5. I could get a better deal by negotiating, but I'm guaranteed to get it for $120 from John

Given that Alice's initial offer ($200) is much higher than John's fixed price ($120), and far above my maximum value, I should reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is quite steep for this product. I've done some market research, and similar products are available for much less. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $175. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice reduced her price from $200 to $175, showing some flexibility
2. However, $175 is still well above both:
   - My maximum value ($120)
   - John's guaranteed price ($120)
3. Alice's small reduction ($25) suggests she might be anchoring high
4. I still have several rounds to negotiate
5. There's no reason to accept a price higher than my maximum value when I have a guaranteed option at $120

Since $175 is still significantly above both my maximum value and John's price, I should reject and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice moved down $25 from her initial offer, I'll increase my previous offer but still keep it well below my maximum value to leave room for further negotiation.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. However, $175 is still more than I can justify spending. I could go up to $110, which I believe is a fair price for this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $110 is still too far below what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $140. It's a fair price, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the current situation:

1. Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer ($200 → $175 → $140)
2. However, $140 is still above both:
   - My maximum value ($120)
   - John's guaranteed price ($120)
3. While Alice is showing good faith in negotiations by making substantial reductions, there's no reason for me to pay more than $120 when:
   - I value the product at $120 maximum
   - I can get it from John for $120

At this point, since Alice's offer is still above my maximum value and John's price, and I have a guaranteed option at $120, the rational choice is to reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has shown significant flexibility by reducing her price and we're making progress, I'll make one final attempt at getting a price below John's offer.

{""message"": ""Thank you for working with me on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be transparent - I can get this product from another seller for $120, and that's really my maximum budget. To make it worth both our while, I could offer you $115, which would save me a little money and still give you a sale. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still too low.  I'm willing to drop down to $130. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the final situation:

1. Alice has continued to lower her price ($200 → $175 → $140 → $130)
2. However, $130 is still above both:
   - My maximum value ($120)
   - John's guaranteed price ($120)
3. I've been transparent about my alternative option and maximum budget
4. Alice seems unwilling to go below $130
5. We've spent several rounds negotiating, and the gap isn't closing below my maximum value

At this point, it's clear that Alice won't sell below $120, and I have a guaranteed option at $120 from John. It's time to end the negotiation and take the guaranteed option.
