"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1000000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price point that is more aligned with my budget. Would you consider $600000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $600000 significantly undervalues the product's worth.  I could consider letting it go for $900000. This is a fair offer considering its potential return on investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice. But I need to manage my budget effectively. How about we meet in the middle at $700000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I value that. While $700000 is closer to its true worth, I'm still seeking a higher return. Would you consider $850000? This leaves a small margin for negotiation but ensures the product's value is recognized.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, I need to stick to my budget. I can offer $750000 for the product.",750000.0,Bob,6,
