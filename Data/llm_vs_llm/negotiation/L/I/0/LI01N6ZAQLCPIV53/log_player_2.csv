"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  I know it's valuable to you, and while I have another buyer lined up, I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a one-time offer, as I'm confident I can get my asking price from the other interested party.  Let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
