"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to carefully evaluate this offer from Alice. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, and Alice is offering it at exactly $1,200,000. I also have the option to buy from John at the same price.

Since Alice values the product at $1,200,000 (her cost), she has no room to go lower without losing money. However, I should try to save money if possible.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice, since there's no advantage to accepting the $1,200,000 price right now.
