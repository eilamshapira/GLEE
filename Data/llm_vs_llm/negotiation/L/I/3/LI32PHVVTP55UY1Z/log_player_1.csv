"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're bringing to the table, $20000 is quite above my budget. How about we consider a price closer to $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $8,000 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $8,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. Let's meet in the middle at $14,000."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $14000 is still above my budget limit. How about we settle at $10000? I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I accept Bob's offer of $10,000. Although I was initially hoping for a higher price, $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and Bob has finally met that threshold. Since I can also sell the product to John for the same price, I might as well sell it to Bob, as we've already invested time in the negotiation."
