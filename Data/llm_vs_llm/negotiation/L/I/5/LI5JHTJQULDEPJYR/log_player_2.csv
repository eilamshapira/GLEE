"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to offer you my product for $100. This is a one‐time opportunity, and if it doesn’t work for you, I'll be selling it to someone else for $80. Let me know if you're in! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer is $100, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and I have the option to buy the same product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in accepting Alice's offer over buying from John. However, rejecting Alice's offer and then deciding to buy from John essentially puts me in the same position as accepting Alice's offer, given that John's price is also $100. But, considering Alice mentioned she'd sell it to someone else for $80 if I don't take it, this implies she values it at least at $80, and there might be room for negotiation or she might come back with a better offer if I reject. However, since my goal is to save as much money as possible and I don't have any indication that Alice will lower her price, and given that buying from John is my fallback at the same price, the most straightforward decision based on the information given is to reject Alice's offer and then buy from John, as this does not close the door on potentially getting a better deal from Alice if she were to reconsider, but since the instruction is to choose among the given options directly related to Alice's offer:
