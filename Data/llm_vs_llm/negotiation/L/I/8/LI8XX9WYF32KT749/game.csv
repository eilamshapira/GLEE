"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $17500 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and the value I'll get from the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10000 is too low for this product. I know its value in the market, and considering its quality, I can offer it to you for $15500. This is already a significant reduction from my initial price.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for reducing the price. However, $15500 is still a bit above what I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11500. I believe this is a reasonable price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your current price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
