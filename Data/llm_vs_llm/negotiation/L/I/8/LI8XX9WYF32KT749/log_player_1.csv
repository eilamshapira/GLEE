Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $17,500. This is a fair price considering the quality and value of the product."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $17500 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. Bob's offer of $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even below his own valuation of $12,000. We can try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is too low for this product. I know its value in the market, and considering its quality, I can offer it to you for $15,500. This is already a significant reduction from my initial price."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for reducing the price. However, $15500 is still a bit above what I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11500. I believe this is a reasonable price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your current price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and we seem to be far from reaching an agreement that would satisfy both parties, I'll take John's guaranteed offer of $15,000. This ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price and saves us both time in further negotiations."
