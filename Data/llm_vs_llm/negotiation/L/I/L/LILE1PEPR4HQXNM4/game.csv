"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I believe $1150000 is a bit high. Given the market conditions, I'm willing to offer $1050000 for the product. This represents a solid profit margin for you while being a fair price for me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1050000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1100000, which is still a great deal for you given the product's worth. Let's try to find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. You've moved $50000, so I'll also move up by the same amount. I can offer $1075000, which would be a fair middle ground between our positions. This still gives you a healthy profit while being a reasonable price for me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, at $1087500. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to secure a good deal. Let me know what you think.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
