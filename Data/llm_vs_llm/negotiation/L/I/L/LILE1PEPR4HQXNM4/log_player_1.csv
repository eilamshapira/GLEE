Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I believe $1150000 is a bit high. Given the market conditions, I'm willing to offer $1050000 for the product. This represents a solid profit margin for you while being a fair price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
