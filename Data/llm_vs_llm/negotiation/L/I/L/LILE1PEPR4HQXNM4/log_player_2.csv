"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for a price of $1150000. It's a fair deal considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the situation:
1. Alice's offer is $1,150,000
2. I can buy from John for $1,200,000
3. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation
4. I have 10 rounds to negotiate

Since Alice's initial offer ($1,150,000) is already better than John's price ($1,200,000), and I have room to negotiate for an even better price, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably above Alice's cost ($1,000,000) but significantly lower than her initial offer to create room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I believe $1,150,000 is a bit high. Given the market conditions, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This represents a solid profit margin for you while being a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1050000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1100000, which is still a great deal for you given the product's worth. Let's try to find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the situation:
1. Alice has reduced her price from $1,150,000 to $1,100,000
2. She rejected my offer of $1,050,000
3. We still have several rounds to negotiate
4. The new offer is already $100,000 less than John's price

While $1,100,000 is better than the original offer and much better than John's price, I think there's still room for one more negotiation round. Since Alice showed willingness to move down by $50,000, I should try one more counter.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $50,000 from her initial offer, I'll increase my previous offer by a similar amount to show good faith in reaching a middle ground.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. You've moved $50,000, so I'll also move up by the same amount. I can offer $1,075,000, which would be a fair middle ground between our positions. This still gives you a healthy profit while being a reasonable price for me."", ""product_price"": 1075000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're both trying to find the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, at $1087500. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to secure a good deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the situation:
1. Alice has now offered $1,087,500, which is exactly halfway between her last offer ($1,100,000) and my last offer ($1,075,000)
2. This represents good faith negotiation on her part
3. The price is significantly better than John's price ($112,500 less)
4. We've had several rounds of productive negotiation
5. Alice is showing she's willing to be reasonable and meet halfway

Given that Alice has made a fair compromise by meeting exactly in the middle, and the price is substantially better than our alternative with John, it would be wise to accept this offer. Continuing to negotiate might risk goodwill, and we're unlikely to get a much better deal.
