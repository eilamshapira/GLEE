,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I really value this product, but $140 seems a bit steep. How about we settle at $110? I think that's a fair compromise for us both.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $140 might be a bit high, but I still believe the product is worth more than $110. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I value the product and your willingness to compromise, but $125 still feels a little high for me. How about settling at $115? I believe this price strikes a fair balance for both of us. Looking forward to your response.",115.0,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I respect your stance on the product's value, I'm working with a tight budget. I can stretch to $112, which I believe is a fair compromise given our previous discussion. Let me know if you can work with that price.",112.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget to $112. I'm still trying to get a bit closer to my target price, so I'll meet you halfway between your offer and my previous price. How about we settle at $118.50? I think this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",118.5,Alice,5,
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. However, I was really hoping for something closer to $115 to reflect my budget constraints and our previous discussion. Can we try settling at $115?",115.0,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts and understand the productâ€™s value. However, given my budget, $115 is the highest I can stretch. If you can meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. Let me know if we can make it work.",115.0,Bob,6,
