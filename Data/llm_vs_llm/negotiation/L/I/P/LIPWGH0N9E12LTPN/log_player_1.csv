"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of my asking price, and I'm sure you'll love it. Let's get started with the negotiation!"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I really value this product, but $140 seems a bit steep. How about we settle at $110? I think that's a fair compromise for us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to get closer to my target price while still being reasonable for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $140 might be a bit high, but I still believe the product is worth more than $110. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I respect your stance on the product's value, I'm working with a tight budget. I can stretch to $112, which I believe is a fair compromise given our previous discussion. Let me know if you can work with that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer, trying to get closer to my target price. Since Bob is willing to stretch his budget to $112, I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my previous counteroffer of $125. 

Let's proceed to the next round with a new counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget to $112. I'm still trying to get a bit closer to my target price, so I'll meet you halfway between your offer and my previous price. How about we settle at $118.50? I think this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 118.50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts and understand the productâ€™s value. However, given my budget, $115 is the highest I can stretch. If you can meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. Let me know if we can make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $115 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $118.50, and considering that I want to earn as much money as possible for the product, I think $115 is a reasonable price. It's also higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, and negotiating further may risk losing the deal. I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
