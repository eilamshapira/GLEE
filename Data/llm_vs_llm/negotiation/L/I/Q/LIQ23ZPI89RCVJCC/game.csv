"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12000 is significantly below the true value of this product and what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $15000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15000 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $13000? This price feels more aligned with my budget and what I believe is a fair value for the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $13000. Would you consider $14000?  That's my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
