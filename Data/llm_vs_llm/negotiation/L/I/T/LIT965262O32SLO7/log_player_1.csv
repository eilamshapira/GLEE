Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic decision here. The product is worth $8,000 to me, and it's also worth $8,000 to Bob. If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell it to John for $8,000.

Since Bob values the product exactly at $8,000, he would be indifferent to buying it at exactly $8,000 (no gain). If I offer any price above $8,000, Bob would reject it since it would result in a loss for him. If I offer any price below $8,000, Bob would accept, but I'd be leaving money on the table compared to my guaranteed alternative with John.

Given that I have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 (John), the rational choice is to offer Bob the product at exactly $8,000. This maximizes my earnings while giving Bob a fair price at his valuation.
