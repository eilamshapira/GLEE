"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to decide between accepting Alice's offer at $15,000 or buying from John at $12,000.

Since Alice's offer ($15,000) is higher than both:
1. The maximum I'm willing to pay ($12,000)
2. John's offer ($12,000)

The logical choice is to buy from John and save $3,000.
