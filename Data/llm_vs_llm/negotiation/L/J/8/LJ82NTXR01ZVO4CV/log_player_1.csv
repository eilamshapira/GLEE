Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $140 seems a bit high. Given market conditions, I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. This would still give you a good profit margin while being a fair price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but $100 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $120. This way, we both get a fair deal."
