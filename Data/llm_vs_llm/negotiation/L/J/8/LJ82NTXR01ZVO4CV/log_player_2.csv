"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $140. It's a great value and I think you'll be very happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. Alice's offer is $140
3. John's fixed price is $150
4. The product is worth $80 to Alice, so she has room to negotiate down

Alice's initial offer of $140 is quite high, considering her cost is $80. While it's below my maximum value of $150, I believe there's room for negotiation to get a better price. Since I can always fall back to John's offer of $150, I should try to negotiate with Alice first.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but leaves room for negotiation:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $140 seems a bit high. Given market conditions, I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. This would still give you a good profit margin while being a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after considering your offer, I'm willing to lower my price to $120. This price reflects the product's value and ensures a fair deal for both of us. I hope you find this acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has reduced her price significantly from $140 to $120
2. This is a $30 savings compared to John's price of $150
3. While Alice's cost is $80, and there might be room for further negotiation, $120 is a reasonable price
4. There's a risk that if I push too hard, Alice might increase her price or become less willing to negotiate

Given that $120 represents a good discount from both her initial offer and John's price, and it's a fair price considering her cost and my maximum value, I'll accept this offer.
