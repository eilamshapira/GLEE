"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I certainly understand that $120 might be too high for you, but $60 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle?

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 100}

Bob, I understand that we both want to find a fair price for this product. I've lowered my offer to $100, which I believe is a reasonable middle ground. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a great value for the quality of the product. What do you think?"
