Send your offer to Bob.,"Since the product is worth $15,000 to me (as I can sell it to John for that price), and it's worth $10,000 to Bob, I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum acceptable price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is well below both my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and even below what the product is worth to him ($10,000), and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Bob.
