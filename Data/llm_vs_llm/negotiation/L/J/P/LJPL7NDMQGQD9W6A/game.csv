"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I believe a more reasonable price would be $600000, which I think reflects a fair market value for this product. I'm open to further discussion to find a price that works for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $2000000 may be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $600000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'd like to offer a price that's significantly lower than my initial offer, but still reflects the product's value.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price significantly, Alice. However, $1500000 is still beyond what I can justify for this product. To meet you partway from my previous offer, I can offer $800000. This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price that could work for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $800000. I'm glad we're moving closer, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Considering your latest offer, I'm willing to make a concession and lower my price further. However, I need to stay above $1000000 to make this deal work for me.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
