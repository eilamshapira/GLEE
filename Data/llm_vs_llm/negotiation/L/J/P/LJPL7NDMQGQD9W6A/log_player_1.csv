Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I believe a more reasonable price would be $600000, which I think reflects a fair market value for this product. I'm open to further discussion to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $600,000 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'd like to proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually agreeable price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price significantly, Alice. However, $1500000 is still beyond what I can justify for this product. To meet you partway from my previous offer, I can offer $800000. This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price that could work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

I reject Bob's offer of $800,000 because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Although Bob has increased his offer, I believe the product is worth more and I'd like to continue negotiating. I'll send another counteroffer to try to meet Bob at a price that works for both of us."
