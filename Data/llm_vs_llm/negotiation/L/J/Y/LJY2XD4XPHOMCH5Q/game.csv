"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9000 is too far below what I can accept for this product. My bottom line is $15000, which is actually the same price I have from another interested buyer (John). However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach an agreement. Could you reconsider your offer?",15000.0,Alice,3,
