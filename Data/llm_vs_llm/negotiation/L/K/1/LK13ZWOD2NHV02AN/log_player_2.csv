"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative price ($8,000). It would be irrational to accept this offer when I have a guaranteed better option with John. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 6000}

I'll offer $6,000, which is significantly below John's price of $8,000. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing me to get a better deal than John's offer. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground, but I still have John's $8,000 offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $11,000 is still substantially higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative price ($8,000). While she did reduce the price from her initial offer, it's still not competitive with John's option. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round, but if Alice doesn't come down significantly in price, I may need to take John's offer soon to ensure I get the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 7000}

I'll increase my offer to $7,000, which is still below John's price but shows I'm willing to move up from my previous offer. This gives Alice room to negotiate while still potentially giving me a better deal than John's $8,000. If Alice doesn't come closer to this range, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($8,500) is still above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000)
2. While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate down, she's still not beating John's price
3. We're already halfway through our negotiation rounds
4. There's no guarantee Alice will go below $8,000
5. John's offer is guaranteed and matches my maximum value

It's best to take the sure deal with John rather than risk further negotiations that might not result in a better price."
