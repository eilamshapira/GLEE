Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I believe it's a reasonable price considering my budget and the product's worth to me. I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer is equal to the minimum amount I'm willing to accept, but I believe the product is worth more, I'll try to negotiate further to see if Bob is willing to increase his offer. My next counteroffer will be lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's current offer.

Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 10000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I was thinking of $9000. I believe it's a reasonable price considering our previous discussions. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

I've decided to accept Bob's offer of $9,000. This price is higher than the minimum amount I'm willing to accept ($8,000), and it seems that Bob is making a genuine effort to meet me halfway. Further negotiations may not yield a significantly better price, and I risk losing the sale if I push too hard. Therefore, I'm willing to accept $9,000 as a fair price for the product."
