"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a high initial offer to test Bob's willingness to pay and leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 (John's guaranteed offer). There's no reason to accept an offer that's $300,000 below my guaranteed alternative. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite low at $500,000, but I need to show some movement from my initial $1,200,000 offer to keep the negotiation going, I'll reduce my price but still keep it well above my minimum of $800,000.

{""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's new offer of $600,000 is still $200,000 below John's guaranteed offer of $800,000. While Bob is moving up in his offers ($500,000 to $600,000), he's still far from an acceptable price. Given that we're now in round 4 and Bob's increments are relatively small, and I have a guaranteed better alternative, it makes sense to sell to John rather than continue this negotiation that may not reach my minimum acceptable price.
