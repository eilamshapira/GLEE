(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

This counter-offer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation while being well below my maximum budget and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

``` 

Alice came down a bit, but the price is still too high. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to move, but I'm still staying well below her current offer and my maximum budget."
