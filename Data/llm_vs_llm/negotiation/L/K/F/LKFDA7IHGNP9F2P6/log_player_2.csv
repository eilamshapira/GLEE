"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a truly exceptional product that I believe you'll find invaluable. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. I think this is a fantastic opportunity for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), the rational decision is to buy from John. It would be financially unwise to accept Alice's offer when I can get the same product for $500,000 less from John.
