Send your offer to Bob.,"Since I know the product is worth $100 to Bob and $120 to me, I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum value.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable value of $120, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $120, I will take option 3.
