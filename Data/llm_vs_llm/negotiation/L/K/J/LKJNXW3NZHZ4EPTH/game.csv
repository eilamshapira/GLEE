"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to consider $10000 for the product. I hope we can find a deal that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand budget concerns, but I can't go as low as $10000 since the product is worth no less than $15000 to me. I can offer it to you at $16000, which is already a reduction from my initial offer. This product offers great value and I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $11000. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering my budget constraints. I hope you can work with me on this.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but I need to be transparent that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $15000 for the product. This is my minimum acceptable price based on the product's value. I'm willing to offer it to you at $15000 as well, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I'd prefer to do business with you if possible, but I cannot go below this price point.",15000.0,Alice,5,
