"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to consider my options carefully:

Option 1: Accept Alice's offer for $1,200,000
Option 2: Reject Alice's offer
Option 3: Buy from John for $1,200,000

Alice's offer is $1,200,000, which is exactly the same as John's price and exactly equal to my maximum valuation. Since neither offer gives me any consumer surplus (savings), and the product is worth exactly what I'd be paying, I'm indifferent between Alice's and John's offers.

Since I need to make a decision, I'll accept Alice's offer since she made the effort to present it first.
