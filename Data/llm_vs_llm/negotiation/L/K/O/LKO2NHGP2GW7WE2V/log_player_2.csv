"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that could significantly benefit your business. I understand this is a substantial investment, so I'm willing to negotiate. Please let me know your thoughts on a price of $1000000. I'm confident this product is worth more to you than $800000, but I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
