Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. I'm offering you our exclusive product today for $3,000,000. This is a unique opportunity — let me know if you’d like to proceed or if you have any thoughts on the price."", ""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $3000000 is significantly above my budget. I've researched the market extensively, and I'm aware of similar products available for much less. I value the product at $800000 and would like to make an offer at this price. This is a fair starting point that allows room for negotiation while reflecting market realities. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
