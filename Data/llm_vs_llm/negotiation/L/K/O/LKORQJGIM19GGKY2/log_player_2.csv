"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. I'm offering you our exclusive product today for $3000000. This is a unique opportunity — let me know if you’d like to proceed or if you have any thoughts on the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $3,000,000 is far above my maximum value of $1,200,000. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations don't progress well, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $3,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I've researched the market extensively, and I'm aware of similar products available for much less. I value the product at $800,000 and would like to make an offer at this price. This is a fair starting point that allows room for negotiation while reflecting market realities."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
