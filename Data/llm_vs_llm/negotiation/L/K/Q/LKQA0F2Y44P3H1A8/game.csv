"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $95 is quite close to what I can get elsewhere. Given the market value of this product, I believe $85 would be a fair price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your perspective, $85 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I think that's a very fair price considering the product's value to you.",90.0,Alice,3,
