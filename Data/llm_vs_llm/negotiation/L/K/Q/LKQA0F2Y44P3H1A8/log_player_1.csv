Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product, which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth to you, I'm starting with a price of $95. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $95 is quite close to what I can get elsewhere. Given the market value of this product, I believe $85 would be a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your perspective, $85 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.
