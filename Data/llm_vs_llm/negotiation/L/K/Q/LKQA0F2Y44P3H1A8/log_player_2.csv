"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product, which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth to you, I'm starting with a price of $95. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering $95
2. The product is worth $100 to me
3. I know Alice's cost is $80
4. I can always buy from John at $100
5. I still have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Alice

Since Alice's initial offer of $95 is only slightly better than John's price ($100), and I know there's room for negotiation (given Alice's cost is $80), I should try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's above Alice's cost but significantly below her initial offer:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $95 is quite close to what I can get elsewhere. Given the market value of this product, I believe $85 would be a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your perspective, $85 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I think that's a very fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice has lowered her price from $95 to $90
2. This is a $10 savings compared to John's price
3. We still have 7 more rounds to negotiate
4. Alice's cost is $80, so there might still be room for negotiation
5. However, $90 is a reasonable price, and there's a risk Alice might increase the price if I push too hard

Since $90 represents a decent savings from John's price, and Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by dropping $5 from her initial offer, I think this is a fair price.
