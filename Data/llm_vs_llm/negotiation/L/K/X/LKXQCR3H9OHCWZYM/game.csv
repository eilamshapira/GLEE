"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $120 is more than I'm looking to spend on this product. I know I can get the same product from John for $80, but I'd like to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to sell it for $70? This would allow me to save a bit compared to John's price while still giving you a reasonable return.",70.0,Bob,2,
