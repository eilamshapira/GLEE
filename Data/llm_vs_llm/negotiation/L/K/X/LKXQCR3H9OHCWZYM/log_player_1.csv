"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $120 is more than I'm looking to spend on this product. I know I can get the same product from John for $80, but I'd like to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to sell it for $70? This would allow me to save a bit compared to John's price while still giving you a reasonable return. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
