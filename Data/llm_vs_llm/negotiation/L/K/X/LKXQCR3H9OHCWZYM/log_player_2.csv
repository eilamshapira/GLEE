"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Analyzing this offer:
- Alice is offering the product for $120
- The product is worth at most $80 to me
- I can buy the product from John for $80
- Alice's product is worth $100 to her

Alice's offer of $120 exceeds both the maximum I'm willing to pay ($80) and John's alternative offer ($80). It doesn't make sense to accept this offer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $120 is more than I'm looking to spend on this product. I know I can get the same product from John for $80, but I'd like to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to sell it for $70? This would allow me to save a bit compared to John's price while still giving you a reasonable return."", ""product_price"": 70}"
