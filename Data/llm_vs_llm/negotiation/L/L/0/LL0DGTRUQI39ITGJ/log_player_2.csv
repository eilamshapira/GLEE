"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Based on the information given:

1. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $15,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $10,000

Since Alice's offer ($15,000) is higher than both the product's worth to me and John's alternative offer, the rational decision would be to buy from John for $10,000.
