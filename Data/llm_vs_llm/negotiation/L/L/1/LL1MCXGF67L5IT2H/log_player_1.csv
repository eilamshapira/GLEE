"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $1,500,000 to me and only $1,000,000 to Bob, I'll start with a high offer but leave some room for potential negotiation.

{""product_price"": 1,800,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $800,000 is well below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000, and he's offering even less than what the product is worth to him ($1,000,000), this shows he's not negotiating in good faith. Given that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it makes sense to end the negotiation now.
