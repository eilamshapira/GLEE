"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks promising,  $12000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11000, considering the product's exceptional features and potential long-term benefits. I'm willing to make a concession, but I believe $8000 is a bit too low. Let's meet somewhere in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we split the difference from our previous offers and settle at $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Splitting the difference is a good idea, but I was thinking we could meet a bit closer to my previous offer. How about we settle at $10250? I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,
