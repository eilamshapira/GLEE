"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's quality and potential benefits. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's starting price is higher than our maximum budget and also higher than John's offer. We should negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks promising,  $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

Reason: We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This tactic helps us gauge Alice's lowest acceptable price and leaves room for negotiation. We don't want to go too low and offend Alice, but we also want to make sure we get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11000, considering the product's exceptional features and potential long-term benefits. I'm willing to make a concession, but I believe $8000 is a bit too low. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice came down slightly, but the offer is still higher than both our budget and John's price.  We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we split the difference from our previous offers and settle at $9,500?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

Reason: We want to demonstrate willingness to negotiate while staying below our budget and John's offer. Splitting the difference is a common tactic and might seem fair to Alice. We're getting close to a point where we might consider accepting if Alice counters with a small reduction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Splitting the difference is a good idea, but I was thinking we could meet a bit closer to my previous offer. How about we settle at $10250? I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

While Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's clear she's unlikely to go much lower than $10,000. At this point, the potential savings aren't worth the risk of continued negotiation, especially with several rounds remaining.  John offers a guaranteed price that's slightly better than Alice's current offer, so it's time to cut our losses and buy from John."
