"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. It's in excellent condition and I believe it could be a great fit for you. I'm offering it for $250. Could that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given the information:
- You value the product at no more than $120
- Alice is offering it for $250
- John is offering the same product for $120

Alice's offer ($250) is significantly higher than both your maximum valuation ($120) and John's price ($120). It makes the most financial sense to buy from John.
