"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $120 to Alice, so she has room to negotiate down
2. My maximum value is $150 (which is also John's price)
3. $145 is very close to my maximum price, and I can likely get a better deal from Alice
4. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's no rush to accept this high initial offer

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's cost is $120, and my maximum is $150, I'll start with a price closer to her cost to leave room for negotiation. I'll offer a price that's slightly above her cost but significantly below her initial offer.

{""product_price"": 130}

This offer:
1. Gives Alice a $10 profit margin
2. Saves me $20 compared to John's price
3. Leaves room for negotiation if Alice counters
4. Is a reasonable starting point that isn't insultingly low"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has lowered her price from $145 to $140, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However:
1. She's still significantly above her cost of $120
2. I still have 7 more rounds to negotiate
3. She dropped $5 from her initial offer, showing there's room for more movement
4. $140 is still close to John's price of $150

I'll reject and try another counteroffer, as there's still substantial room between her cost ($120) and current offer ($140).

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Let me increase my previous offer but still keep it at a level that's beneficial for both parties:

{""product_price"": 135}

This counteroffer:
1. Is a $5 increase from my previous offer of $130
2. Meets Alice halfway between my last offer ($130) and her last offer ($140)
3. Gives Alice a $15 profit margin above her cost
4. Still saves me $15 compared to John's price
5. Shows I'm willing to negotiate upward but in reasonable increments"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","This is getting more interesting:
1. Alice has moved down from $140 to $138, showing continued willingness to negotiate
2. The gap between our positions is narrowing ($138 vs my last offer of $135)
3. This price saves me $12 compared to John's price
4. We still have 5 rounds left, but the increments are getting smaller
5. Alice is still making a good profit ($18 above her cost)

Since the movement is getting smaller and we're approaching a fair middle ground, I'll accept this offer.
