"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product, and I believe it would be a great fit for you. Considering its value and the benefits it can bring, I'm willing to let it go for $14999. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth at most $8,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $14,999
3. I can definitely buy it from John for $8,000

Since Alice's offer is significantly higher than both the product's worth to me and John's alternative price, the logical choice is to buy from John instead.
