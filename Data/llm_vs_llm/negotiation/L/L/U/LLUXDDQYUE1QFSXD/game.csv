"Hello Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you. It's a high-quality item that provides excellent value. Based on market research and the product's features, I'm offering it to you for $15000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's quality and benefits. Would you like to proceed with the purchase?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $8000. The product is worth at least $10000 to me based on its quality and market value. I understand budget concerns, so I'm willing to come down to $13500. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of the product. Would this work better for you?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $13500, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think we can find a better price. Since you mentioned the product is worth at least $10000 to you, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,4,
