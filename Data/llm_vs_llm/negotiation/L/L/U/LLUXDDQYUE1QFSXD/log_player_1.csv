Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $8,000.
