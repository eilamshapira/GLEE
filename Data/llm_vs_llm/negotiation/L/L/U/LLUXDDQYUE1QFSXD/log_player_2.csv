Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $8000. The product is worth at least $10000 to me based on its quality and market value. I understand budget concerns, so I'm willing to come down to $13500. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of the product. Would this work better for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.
