"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's offer of $20,000 exceeds the $8,000 value that the product is worth to me, and Jhon is willing to sell the product for exactly $8,000, it makes financial sense to go with Jhon's option.
