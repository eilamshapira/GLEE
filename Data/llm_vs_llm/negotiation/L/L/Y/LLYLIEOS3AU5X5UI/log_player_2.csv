"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $150 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120). It would not be rational to accept this offer. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 90}

I'll offer $90, which is below Alice's cost ($120) but gives room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $120 to Alice, I expect her to reject this offer, but it establishes a lower anchor point for further negotiation. If we can't reach a mutually beneficial agreement after a few rounds, I can always fall back to John's offer of $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice only reduced her price by $10 (from $150 to $140), which is still well above both my maximum value and John's price of $120. There's no reason to accept this offer when I can either:
1. Continue negotiating for a better price
2. Buy from John for $120 if the negotiation doesn't progress favorably

I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round. Given that we have several rounds remaining, there's still opportunity to reach a better price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 100}

I'm increasing my offer by $10 from my previous offer of $90 to show willingness to negotiate and move towards a middle ground. However, I'm still keeping the price below Alice's cost ($120) to allow room for further negotiation. This price point signals that I'm willing to move up, but also indicates that I won't go as high as $120 since that's available from John. The strategy is to gradually work towards a price that could be mutually beneficial, while maintaining the credible alternative of buying from John at $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $120. Here's why:

1. Alice's latest offer ($130) is still above John's price ($120)
2. Alice has only moved down from $150 to $130 over several rounds, suggesting she may not be willing to go below $120
3. Since $120 is my maximum value for the product, and John offers exactly that price, there's no reason to continue negotiating
4. Even if Alice eventually matches John's price, I wouldn't get any better deal than $120

It's more efficient to take John's guaranteed offer of $120 rather than spend more rounds negotiating with Alice for potentially no better outcome."
