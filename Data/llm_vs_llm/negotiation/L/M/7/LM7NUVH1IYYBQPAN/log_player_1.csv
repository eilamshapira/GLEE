Send your offer to Bob.,"Looking at this situation, I need to make a strategic decision about my pricing.

The product is worth $1,000,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at exactly that price. Bob values the product at $800,000, which means he won't pay more than that amount.

Since Bob won't pay above $800,000 and I already have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, it doesn't make economic sense for me to offer Bob any price below $1,000,000. If I offer Bob a price at or above $1,000,000, he will reject it since it exceeds his valuation.

Therefore, I'll make an offer to Bob that I know he'll reject, allowing me to sell to John instead.
