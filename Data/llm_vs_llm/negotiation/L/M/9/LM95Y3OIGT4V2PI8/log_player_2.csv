"Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Looking at the offer, Alice is asking for $250 which is more than the $150 the product is worth to me. I also have the option to buy from John for exactly $150. Since Alice's price is higher than my maximum value, and John's price equals my maximum value, the rational choice is to either negotiate with Alice for a better price or go with John's guaranteed offer.
