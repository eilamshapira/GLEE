"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and Alice's offer is $200, which is far beyond my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. Additionally, since I have the option to buy the product from John for $80, which is within my budget, I don't need to consider accepting Alice's offer or buying from her at a later time. My decision is to buy from John directly as it fits my budget perfectly.
