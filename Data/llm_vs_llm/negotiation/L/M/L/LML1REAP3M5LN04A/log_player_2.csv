"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I'm currently offering for sale. I want to be transparent that if you decide not to purchase it, I already have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $80 for it. However, I'd like to give you the first opportunity to purchase this product. Based on its quality and features, I'm offering it to you for $110. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
