I believe this price is more reasonable given the product's value. Let's see if Bob accepts this counteroffer. However, I am aware that I might need to lower my expectations if Bob rejects this offer as we are moving closer to the price that John is willing to pay."

Round 6
{""product_price"": 850000}

Bob is getting closer to the minimum price I can accept. I will try to get him to increase a little bit more and close the deal. However, if he rejects this offer, I might need to consider selling the product to John to ensure I get a good price for my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 850000}

This is a crucial round. I really hope that Bob accepts this offer. If Bob rejects this price I will have to accept John's offer."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"":""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still below the price that John is willing to pay. With only a few rounds left, it's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob. It's better to secure the sale with John for $800,000."
