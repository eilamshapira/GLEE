"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product which I believe will be of great value to you. Given its worth, I'd like to offer it to you at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering the product for $800,000, which is exactly what it's worth to Alice and exactly the same price that John is willing to sell it for.

Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to you, and both Alice and John are offering it at $800,000, there's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other.
