"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice's offer is way above your budget and your maximum price. It's better to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
``` 

This is a starting point for negotiation. It's a significant amount below Alice's asking price, but still leaves room for negotiation upward while staying well under my budget."
