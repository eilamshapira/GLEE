"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in making a deal, but I think $110 is a bit high for this product. Given market conditions, I'm looking to pay $90 for it. This would still give you a $10 profit above your cost, while giving me a better deal than your initial offer. What do you say?",90.0,Bob,2,
