Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in making a deal, but I think $110 is a bit high for this product. Given market conditions, I'm looking to pay $90 for it. This would still give you a $10 profit above your cost, while giving me a better deal than your initial offer. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
