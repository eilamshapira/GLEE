"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you the product for $110. I think it's a great deal for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to analyze this situation carefully. 

Alice is offering me the product for $110, while the product is worth up to $120 to me. So accepting this offer would give me a $10 surplus.

However, John is selling the same product for $120, which would give me no surplus at all.

Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. If I make a counteroffer, I might be able to get a better price than $110, which would increase my surplus.

Based on this analysis, I should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in making a deal, but I think $110 is a bit high for this product.

What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! How about we meet in the middle? I can offer the product to you for $100. I believe it's a fair price for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has come down from $110 to $100, which is a good movement in my favor. The product is worth up to $120 to me, so at $100, I would get a $20 surplus.

Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, she's making a $20 profit at this price.

I could try to negotiate further, but Alice has already shown willingness to compromise by meeting me halfway between her initial $110 and my $90 counteroffer.

Given that John's price is still $120, and Alice is now offering $100, I'm getting a reasonable deal. While I could try to push for a slightly better price, there's also a risk that Alice might get frustrated and increase her price again.
