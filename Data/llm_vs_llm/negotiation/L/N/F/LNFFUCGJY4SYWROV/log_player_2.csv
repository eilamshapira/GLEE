"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value, I'm offering it to you for $20000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
2. Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly above my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $10,000
4. Even though I could make a counteroffer, Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is so high that it suggests she might not be willing to go below $10,000

The most rational decision is to:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

This decision is optimal because:
1. It guarantees I get the product at my maximum acceptable price
2. It saves time and effort in negotiations
3. Given Alice's high initial offer and her product cost ($15,000), it's unlikely she would ever go below $10,000
4. There's no reason to continue negotiations when we have a guaranteed option at our maximum acceptable price"
