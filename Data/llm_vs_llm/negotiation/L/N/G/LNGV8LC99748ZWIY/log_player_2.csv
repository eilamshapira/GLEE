"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe could be a valuable asset for you. Given its features and potential, I'm offering it to you at a price of $1500000. Let me know if you are interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","The decision is clear here. Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000, which is significantly above my maximum value of $800,000. I would actually lose money by accepting this offer. Meanwhile, John is offering the same product for $800,000, which is exactly at my maximum acceptable price.
