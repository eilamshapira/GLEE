Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8500 at this time.  What do you think?

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing you're serious about this product and I want to make a deal. Let's split the difference - $10,750. This takes into account the value it brings while acknowledging your budget.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10750 is still more than I can afford right now. I'm prepared to offer $9750.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

At this point, Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than to risk getting less from Bob."
