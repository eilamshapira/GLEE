Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $15,000 to Bob
2. My minimum acceptable price is $8,000 (as I can sell it to John for this amount)
3. Bob can either accept or reject my offer
4. If I price too high, Bob might reject
5. If I price too low, I'm leaving money on the table

I want to capture a significant portion of the value difference between my minimum ($8,000) and Bob's maximum ($15,000), while still giving Bob enough incentive to accept.

A price of $12,000 would:
- Give me a good profit ($4,000 more than my minimum)
- Give Bob a good deal ($3,000 less than his maximum value)
- Be likely to be accepted as Bob still benefits significantly
