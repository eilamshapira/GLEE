Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $17,500. This is a fair price considering the quality and value of the product."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $17500 is above my budget. I would like to offer $10000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll counter with a lower offer, but I can't accept $10,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob, but I cannot go that low. The product's value is significantly higher. I can reduce my initial price to $16,000."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob, but I cannot go that low. The product's value is significantly higher. I can reduce my initial price to $16,000."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the reduction, Alice, but $16000 is still beyond my budget. I would like to offer $11000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's maximum offer ($11,000) is below my minimum acceptable price ($15,000), and it seems unlikely that he will increase his offer significantly, I will sell the product to John for $15,000. This guarantees me my minimum acceptable price."
