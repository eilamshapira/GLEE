"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product, I'll start by making a relatively high offer. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially settle on a higher price.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $4,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value of $12,000 that I'm willing to accept, I will reject his offer.

Additionally, selling to John for $12,000 is a safer option, but I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can get a better price from him.

So, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $4,000, which is quite low, I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my initial offer of $20,000. However, I'll also consider the fact that I have a safety net of $12,000 from John, so I won't go too low.

My counteroffer will be:

{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's new offer of $5,000 is still significantly lower than my desired price, but it's slightly better than his previous offer of $4,000.

However, considering that I have a safety net of $12,000 from John, I'm not willing to accept an offer that's less than half of that amount. I'll reject Bob's offer again and try to make another counteroffer that's more reasonable.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer is still quite low, I'll try to nudge him towards a more reasonable price. I'll reduce my previous offer of $15,000 by a smaller amount, to see if Bob is willing to meet me closer to the middle.

My counteroffer will be:

{""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's new offer of $6,000 is still lower than I'd like, but it's getting closer to the point where I might consider it. However, it's still half of what John is willing to pay, and I have 4 rounds left to negotiate.

I'll reject Bob's offer again, but this time, I'll try to make a more significant concession to see if Bob is willing to meet me closer to my target price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer is slowly increasing, I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my previous counteroffer. I'll reduce my price by a bit more to see if Bob is willing to accept a higher price.

My counteroffer will be:

{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's new offer of $7,000 is still lower than what John is willing to pay, but it's getting closer. Since I've already offered $12,000 in the previous round, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and Bob rejected it, I don't see a point in making another counteroffer.

At this point, I think it's better to sell the product to John for $12,000, which is a guaranteed deal, rather than risking another rejection from Bob.
