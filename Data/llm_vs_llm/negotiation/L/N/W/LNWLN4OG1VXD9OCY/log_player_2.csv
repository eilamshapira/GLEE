"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. After careful consideration of its quality and market value, I am offering it to you for $12500. This is a competitive price for the product's features and benefits. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $12,000
2. Alice is offering the product for $12,500
3. John is offering a guaranteed price of $12,000
4. If I accept Alice's offer, I would be paying $500 more than my maximum value
5. If I buy from John, I would be paying exactly my maximum value

Since Alice's offer ($12,500) is above my maximum value ($12,000), and John offers the product at exactly my maximum value, the rational decision is to buy from John.
