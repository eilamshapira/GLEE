"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you the product for $120. Let me know if you’d like to buy it at that price—if not, I’ll be selling it to another buyer at the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is implying she won't budge on price, there's still a chance she might come down a little to avoid losing the sale entirely. Rejecting her offer opens the door for a potential counter-offer. If she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John at your maximum price."
