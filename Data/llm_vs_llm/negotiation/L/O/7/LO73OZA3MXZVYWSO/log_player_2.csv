"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: Since Alice's initial offer is $100, which is the same as John's price, it's better to reject and make a counteroffer. Given that the product is worth $80 to Alice, there's room for negotiation to get a better price. By making a counteroffer, we might be able to save money while still allowing Alice to make a profit above her $80 value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 85}

Rationale: I'm offering $85 because:
1. It's above Alice's value of $80, so she can still make a $5 profit
2. It's significantly below both the initial $100 offer and John's price
3. It's a reasonable starting point that leaves room for negotiation if needed
4. If accepted, it would save me $15 compared to buying from John"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Rationale: I'll accept Alice's offer of $90 because:
1. It's a $10 reduction from the initial price and John's price of $100
2. Alice has moved significantly from her initial offer of $100 to $90
3. While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice might not go lower and could even return to a higher price
4. $90 represents a reasonable compromise, as it gives Alice a $10 profit margin (from her $80 value) while giving me a $10 savings compared to John's price
5. Further negotiation might not yield significantly better results and could risk losing this favorable offer"
