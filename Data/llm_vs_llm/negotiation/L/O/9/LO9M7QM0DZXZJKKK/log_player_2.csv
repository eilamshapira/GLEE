"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Given that Alice's offer is $1,500,000 and John is also willing to sell the product for $1,500,000, there is no financial advantage to accepting Alice's offer. Since the goal is to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to see if Alice would accept less.
