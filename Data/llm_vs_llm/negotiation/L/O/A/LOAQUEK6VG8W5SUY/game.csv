"Hello Bob, I understand your position, but I cannot accept $700000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product's true value and quality justify a higher price. However, I'm willing to be flexible and can reduce my initial asking price. I can offer it to you for $875000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.",875000.0,Alice,3,
