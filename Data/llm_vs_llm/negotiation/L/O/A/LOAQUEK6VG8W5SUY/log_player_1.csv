Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great fit for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I believe the price is a bit high. Considering the market value and my budget, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer to Bob since his offer of $700,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Additionally, while I could sell to John for $800,000, I believe there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I understand your position, but I cannot accept $700,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product's true value and quality justify a higher price. However, I'm willing to be flexible and can reduce my initial asking price. I can offer it to you for $875,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 875000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible and reduce the price. However, $875000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $787500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $787,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $800,000. Bob's offer of $787,500 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $800,000, and given the back-and-forth nature of the negotiations, it seems unlikely that Bob will significantly increase his offer above $800,000. Taking John's certain offer is the most profitable decision."
