"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $2500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my alternatives.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but I cannot accept $1000000. The product's value is significantly higher. I'm willing to revise my offer to $2000000, which I believe is still a competitive price considering the product's quality and market value.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
