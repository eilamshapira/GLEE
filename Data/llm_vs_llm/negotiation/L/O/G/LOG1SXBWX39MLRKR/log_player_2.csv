"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer of $14,000 is already a good deal as it's below my maximum budget of $15,000. There's no guarantee I could get a better price by negotiating further, and I risk losing the opportunity to buy it at this price."
