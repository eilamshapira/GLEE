"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8000 to you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since the product is worth $8,000 to me and Alice's offer is $9,500, which is higher than my desired price, I will reject Alice's offer. I will make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll offer a price that is closer to my maximum budget of $8,000.

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 8200}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8200 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8800. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let's make this happen!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $8,800 is still higher than my maximum budget of $8,000, but it's getting closer. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $8,000, I don't see a reason to accept Alice's offer. I'll reject Alice's offer again and consider buying from John, as it's still the best option for me.
