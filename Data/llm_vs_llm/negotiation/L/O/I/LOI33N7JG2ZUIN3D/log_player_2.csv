"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer is $15,000, which is exactly the same as John's price, and it's also the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, there's no advantage in accepting Alice's offer over buying from John. However, I can try to negotiate with Alice for a better price by rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a significantly lower offer to leave room for negotiation. Since $15,000 is my maximum value and Alice's initial offer was at that maximum, I'll start at about 60% of that value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has significantly reduced the price from $15,000 to $12,000, which is a $3,000 savings compared to both her initial offer and John's price. While I could try to negotiate further, this is already a substantial discount (20% off the maximum price), and there's a risk that Alice might increase the price in future negotiations if I push too hard. This is a good deal that's well below my maximum price of $15,000.
