Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price to offer.

Since I know my minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000 (as I can sell to John for this amount), and I don't know Bob's maximum value, I should set a price significantly higher than my reservation price to maximize my potential profit while still having John as a backup.

I'll set the price at $1,800,000, which is 50% higher than my minimum price. This gives room for significant profit while still potentially being within Bob's range.
