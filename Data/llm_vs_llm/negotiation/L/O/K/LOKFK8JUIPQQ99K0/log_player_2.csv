"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that the product is worth no more than $800,000 to you, and John is offering to sell it to you for exactly $800,000, Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than both the product's value to you and your alternative option.
