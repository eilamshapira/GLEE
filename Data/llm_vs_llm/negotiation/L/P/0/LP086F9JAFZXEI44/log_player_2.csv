"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to consider my options carefully:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $1,500,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John for $1,000,000

Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, Alice's offer of $1,500,000 exceeds my maximum value. John's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly at my maximum value.

The rational choice is to buy from John, as this saves me $500,000 compared to Alice's offer.
