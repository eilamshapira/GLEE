"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a high initial offer to test Bob's willingness to pay.

{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer ($800,000) is below my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $1,000,000, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer somewhat but still keep it well above my minimum price to maintain room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer ($1,000,000) is exactly the same as John's guaranteed offer, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation with Bob showing resistance to higher prices, I'll accept Bob's offer. There's no advantage in continuing the negotiation or switching to John at this point.
