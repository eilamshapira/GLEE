"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,200,000 (which is also John's price). It would not be rational to accept this offer as it would result in a loss. In the next round, I will make a counteroffer that's below my maximum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

I'm making a counteroffer of $800,000, which is significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer and John's price. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's price of $1,200,000. If Alice rejects this offer, we can continue negotiating towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,700,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000). While Alice has reduced her price from the initial $2,000,000, it's still not acceptable. I'll continue negotiating by making another counteroffer in the next round, as there's still potential to reach a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm making a counteroffer of $1,000,000, which is higher than my previous offer but still below John's price. This shows willingness to move up in price while maintaining room for potential savings compared to John's price of $1,200,000. If Alice rejects this offer, we still have several rounds to negotiate and can always fall back on John's offer if necessary."
