"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking for $175 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Let me know if we can work something out.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $60 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  Let's split the difference.  How about $115?  That would be a great deal for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $70, but that's about as high as I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $70 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down a bit more, but I need to make at least $100 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $90. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Since I can buy the product from John for $80, I'm willing to meet you in the middle of your offer and John's price. How about $85?",85.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit too high for me to sell at $85. How about we compromise at $95? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my original offer.",95.0,Alice,7,
