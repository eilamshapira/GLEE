Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $60 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  Let's split the difference.  How about $115?  That would be a great deal for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $70 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down a bit more, but I need to make at least $100 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $90. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit too high for me to sell at $85. How about we compromise at $95? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my original offer.
