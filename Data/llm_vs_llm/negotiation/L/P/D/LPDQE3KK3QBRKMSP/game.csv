"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Would you be willing to consider that?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from. I can offer the product to you for $10500. It's a fair price considering the value you'll be getting. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your current offer. How about $8250? It's a reasonable price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",8250.0,Bob,4,
