"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I'm interested in it, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and constraints.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and the counteroffer. While I appreciate your offer, $8000 is significantly below what I can accept. The product's unique features and benefits justify a higher price. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $22000.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet in the middle. However, $22000 is still a bit steep for me. Considering my budget and the fact that I can get a similar product from John for $10000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, my rock-bottom price is $20000. I am confident that you will not find a better deal for this unique product. What do you say?",20000.0,Alice,5,
