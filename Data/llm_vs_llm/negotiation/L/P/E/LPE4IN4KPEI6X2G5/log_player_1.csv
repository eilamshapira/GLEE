Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I'm interested in it, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and constraints.

Bob's offer:

This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
