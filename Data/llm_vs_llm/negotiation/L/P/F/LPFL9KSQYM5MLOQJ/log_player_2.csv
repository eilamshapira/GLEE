"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $150
2. My maximum value for the product is $150
3. John's price is also $150

Since all prices are equal ($150), and this is the maximum I'm willing to pay, there's no advantage in choosing one option over another. In this case, I might as well accept Alice's offer since it's the first one presented and matches my maximum price point.
