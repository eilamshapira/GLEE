Hello Bob! I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $180. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?,180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I know I can get a similar product elsewhere for $100. But I'm interested in doing business with you, so I can offer $75 for your product. This would save you the hassle of finding another buyer.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $75 as it's below my cost. While you mentioned finding a similar product elsewhere for $100, I can assure you of my product's superior quality. However, I'm willing to be flexible - I can offer it to you for $140, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and reflects the true value of the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for lowering the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - this product is worth no more than $100 to me, and I have a guaranteed option to buy it at that price elsewhere. I respect the quality of your product, but I can only justify paying $85 for it. This is still a better deal for you than if I walk away and buy elsewhere.",85.0,Bob,4,
