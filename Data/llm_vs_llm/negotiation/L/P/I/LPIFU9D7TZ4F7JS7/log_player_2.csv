"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $180. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $180 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $100 and also higher than John's price of $100. It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations don't go well, I can always buy from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I know I can get a similar product elsewhere for $100. But I'm interested in doing business with you, so I can offer $75 for your product. This would save you the hassle of finding another buyer."", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $75 as it's below my cost. While you mentioned finding a similar product elsewhere for $100, I can assure you of my product's superior quality. However, I'm willing to be flexible - I can offer it to you for $140, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $140 is still above my maximum value of $100 and higher than John's price. While Alice has reduced the price, it's still not competitive with John's offer. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, but if Alice doesn't come down to a price below $100, I'll need to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for lowering the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - this product is worth no more than $100 to me, and I have a guaranteed option to buy it at that price elsewhere. I respect the quality of your product, but I can only justify paying $85 for it. This is still a better deal for you than if I walk away and buy elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 85}"
