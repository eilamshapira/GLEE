"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Alice's offer: $12,001
2. John's price: $12,000
3. My maximum value for the product: $12,000

Since Alice's offer ($12,001) is higher than both:
- The price I can get from John ($12,000)
- The maximum value the product has to me ($12,000)

It would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. Between rejecting the offer and buying from John, buying from John is the better option since I need the product and John's price equals my maximum value.
