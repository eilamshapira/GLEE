"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $120 is quite high for this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $70 for the product. This is a fair price considering similar products in the market.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $70 as it's below my cost. The product is worth at least $100 to me based on its quality and features. However, I'm willing to come down to $110 to work with you. This is still a good value considering what you're getting.",110.0,Alice,3,
