Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $120 is quite high for this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $70 for the product. This is a fair price considering similar products in the market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $70 as it's below my cost. The product is worth at least $100 to me based on its quality and features. However, I'm willing to come down to $110 to work with you. This is still a good value considering what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 110}"
