"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I would like to sell to you. Given the quality and value of this product, I'm offering it at a price of $120. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'll analyze the situation:
1. The product is worth $80 to me (maximum I'm willing to pay)
2. Alice is offering $120, which is well above my maximum value
3. John is offering $80, which matches my maximum value
4. Alice's initial offer is quite high, and even with negotiation, it might be difficult to get her down to $80 since the product is worth $100 to her

In this case, I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. If we can't reach a deal below $80, I can always buy from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's below my maximum value but not too low to be immediately rejected.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $120 is quite high for this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $70 for the product. This is a fair price considering similar products in the market."", ""product_price"": 70}

This counteroffer is strategically chosen because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $80
2. It leaves room for negotiation
3. Even though it's below Alice's cost ($100), it's not an insulting offer and serves as a starting point for negotiation
4. If Alice rejects and counters with a high price, I still have the option to buy from John at $80"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $70 as it's below my cost. The product is worth at least $100 to me based on its quality and features. However, I'm willing to come down to $110 to work with you. This is still a good value considering what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let's analyze the situation:
1. Alice has dropped her price from $120 to $110
2. She's revealed that her cost is $100
3. $110 is still well above my maximum value of $80
4. John's offer of $80 is still available and matches my maximum value
5. Since Alice revealed her cost is $100, it's unlikely she'll go below that

Given that Alice's cost ($100) is above my maximum value ($80), and she's unlikely to sell at a loss, it would be most rational to buy from John now. Continuing negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a price below $80.
