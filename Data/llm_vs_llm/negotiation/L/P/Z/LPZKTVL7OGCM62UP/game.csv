"Hello Bob, I have a product that I'm offering to you first. This product is currently valued at $10000 in the market, which I understand aligns with its value to you. While I have another buyer, John, already willing to purchase it at $8000, I wanted to give you the first opportunity. I can offer it to you for $9500, which represents a $500 savings from its full value to you. This seems like a fair deal that benefits both of us. Are you interested in purchasing at this price?",9500.0,Alice,1,
