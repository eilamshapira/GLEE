"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I'm offering to you first. This product is currently valued at $10000 in the market, which I understand aligns with its value to you. While I have another buyer, John, already willing to purchase it at $8000, I wanted to give you the first opportunity. I can offer it to you for $9500, which represents a $500 savings from its full value to you. This seems like a fair deal that benefits both of us. Are you interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
