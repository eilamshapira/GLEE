"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $1,500,000 and Alice is offering the product at that price, it's the best option to accept her offer. There's no benefit in rejecting and then buying from John at the same price."
