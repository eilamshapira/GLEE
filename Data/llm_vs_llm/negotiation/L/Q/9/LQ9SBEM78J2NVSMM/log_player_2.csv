"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from John would cost you $1,500,000, which is more than Alice's offer of $1,400,000.
* Although Alice's offer is above your ideal price, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer, you can potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $1,400,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* This offer is closer to Alice's value of $1,200,000,  making it more likely for her to accept.
* If she rejects, we can continue negotiating in smaller increments to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is closer to my desired price and still lower than buying from John for $1,500,000.
* It's likely that further negotiation might result in a lower price, but I'm willing to accept this offer to secure the product and avoid the risk of losing it to another buyer."
