Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer to Bob.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll analyze this situation:

- Bob offered $1,300,000, which is $100,000 more than John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000
- The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so he still has room to increase his offer
- My minimum acceptable value is $1,200,000, which I already have guaranteed from John

Since Bob's offer exceeds John's guaranteed price and we can still potentially negotiate a better deal, I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a slightly reduced counteroffer to Bob to progress the negotiation.
