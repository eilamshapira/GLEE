{""message"": ""Alice, that's a very high price for the product. While I see its potential, I'm not ready to pay that much. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of the product to me is significantly higher than that. I'm willing to come down from my initial price, so let's meet in the middle at $2200000.

Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. However, your offer is still at the lower boundary of the product's value to me. Let's settle at $1900000. This price takes into account both our interests.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to accepting your offer, but I need to stay within my budget.  How about we settle on $1,700,000?

I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this final offer."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
