"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a reasonably high offer to leave room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","This is a good offer from Bob. At $10,000, it's significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and it's a reasonable counter to my initial offer. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might lose interest or reduce his offer. Since this is a $2,000 premium over John's guaranteed offer, I'll accept it.
