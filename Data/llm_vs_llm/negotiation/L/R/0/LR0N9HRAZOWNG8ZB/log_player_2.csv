"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer matches your maximum price, there's a chance to negotiate a lower price. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower before settling for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($100) leaves room for negotiation. Alice might accept it outright, or it will give us an idea of her desired selling price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice meeting in the middle at $120 is a good deal. It's a significant savings compared to John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation pushing the price closer to $150."
