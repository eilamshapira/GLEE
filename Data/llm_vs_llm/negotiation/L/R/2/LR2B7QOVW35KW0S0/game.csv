"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $13500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $7000. I think this is a fair price, considering my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",7000.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. However, $7000 is still below my minimum threshold. I can go as low as $12500, which is very close to my bottom line. Let me know if this is something you can consider.",12500.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to lower the price. However, $12500 is still above my budget. Considering your previous message, I'm willing to make a serious offer of $7500, which is the highest I'm willing to go before considering other options. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",7500.0,Bob,6,
