"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I find the initial price a bit high. Given my budget constraints, I'd like to offer $400000 for the product. I believe this is a more feasible starting point for our negotiations.",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. However, I must say that $400000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a concession and lower the price to $2200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, and I'm open to further negotiations.",2200000.0,Alice,3,
