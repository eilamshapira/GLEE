Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I find the initial price a bit high. Given my budget constraints, I'd like to offer $400000 for the product. I believe this is a more feasible starting point for our negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $400,000
