"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting high, but not *too* high. I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so I'm anchoring the negotiation close to that value, aiming to capture a significant portion of his willingness to pay. $1,400,000 allows Bob to still get a decent benefit and therefore more likely to accept. I have 10 rounds, so there's time to adjust downwards if needed. I also have John as a backup, so I don't need to accept below 800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

$1,000,000 is above my minimum of $800,000, but there's still a good chance to negotiate a higher price, given it's worth $1,500,000 to Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Selling to John at this point would be leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm reducing my price from $1,400,000 to $1,300,000. Bob's offer of $1,000,000 shows he's interested in making a deal, but wants a better price. I'm lowering my price by $100,000 to encourage negotiation and show I'm willing to move. I'm still aiming high, as there is more room for negotiation, and the potential to reach a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer, which is a good sign. $1,100,000 is a good number, but I believe there's still room to push for a higher price, given that it is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. I'll proceed with another counteroffer. Selling to John for $800,000 is not even a consideration at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm reducing my price to $1,200,000. This shows further flexibility and is a more moderate decrease than the previous one, signalling that I'm getting closer to my bottom line (even though I'm not!). I am aiming to slowly decrease my offer and see if Bob will meet in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is inching closer, but I still think there's a bit more to squeeze out. I will make another counteroffer, but it will be a small reduction. Selling to John is still off the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Explanation:**

Okay, I'm making a small decrease now to $1,175,000. This shows that I am near my bottom line without actually reaching it. I want Bob to think that this might be as low as I go, so he'll accept the offer in the next round. I am hoping Bob will see that we are close and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,160,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,160,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, we are very close, and there are only two rounds left. Bob is increasing the amount that he is offering by $10,000 from his last offer. I will accept the offer for $1,160,000. It's a good price and I would rather lock it in than risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for only $800,000."
