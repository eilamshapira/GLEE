"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's alternative price ($12,000). It would be wise to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Even if negotiations with Alice don't work out, I can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 8000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $8,000, which is significantly below both John's price and my maximum value. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's offer of $12,000. If Alice counters with a reasonable price between $8,000 and $12,000, I could still achieve a better deal than buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $18,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000). While she has reduced the price from her initial offer of $20,000, it's still not competitive. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. If Alice doesn't come down to a more reasonable price soon, I can always take John's offer of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9500}

I'll increase my previous offer to $9,500. This shows some movement from my initial offer of $8,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still staying well below John's price of $12,000. This gives Alice room to counter while potentially allowing me to secure a better deal than John's offer. Since Alice has shown some flexibility by reducing her price from $20,000 to $18,000, I'm showing similar flexibility by increasing my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($17,500) is still far above John's price ($12,000)
2. While Alice has shown some movement in price (from $20,000 to $18,000 to $17,500), the decrements are small
3. Given the pace of price reduction and that we've already used half our rounds, it seems unlikely Alice will drop her price below John's $12,000
4. Even if Alice eventually comes down in price, there's no guarantee it will be below John's price
5. Since $12,000 is my maximum value anyway, continuing to negotiate with Alice presents unnecessary risk

Therefore, it's most rational to take John's guaranteed offer of $12,000 now."
