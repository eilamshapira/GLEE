"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation:

The product is worth no more than $100 to me (Bob).
Alice is offering it for $90.
If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $100.

Since Alice's offer ($90) is $10 less than John's price ($100), and both would satisfy my need for the product, it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer to save money.
