"Good morning, Bob. I'm excited to begin discussing the acquisition of this unique and valuable asset. Given its exceptional qualities and potential return on investment, I'm initially offering it to you for $1500000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a figure closer to $1000000. This number reflects my current budget and the market conditions.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand budget considerations are important. While $1000000 is lower than I'm comfortable with, I also value the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement with you. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1400000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1400000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's compromise at $1100000. This price point aligns better with my financial goals and market expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me closer to my valuation. However, I'm not quite there yet. Given the unique nature of this asset and the potential value it holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a significant concession on my part and I believe it represents a fair price.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1300000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. In an effort to find a middle ground, I'm willing to raise my offer to $1150000. This price point feels fair and manageable for me.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to move a bit more, recognizing your financial considerations. My absolute lowest offer is $1250000. This is the rock bottom, and reflects my need to recoup my own investment and profit margin. I can't go any lower.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
