Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this:

1. The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $1,500,000
3. Since Bob's valuation is unknown, he might value it significantly higher
4. Setting a price too high risks rejection, but I have nothing to lose since I have John's offer
5. It's reasonable to aim for a premium above my minimum price

Given these factors, I'll offer a price that gives room for significant profit while still potentially being acceptable to Bob.
