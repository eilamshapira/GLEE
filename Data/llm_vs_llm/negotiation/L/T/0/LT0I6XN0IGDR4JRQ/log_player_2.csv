"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $80 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $150
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $80
4. If I buy from Alice, I'll pay $150
5. If I buy from John, I'll pay $80

Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and Alice's offer ($150) is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price, the rational decision would be to buy from John.
