Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, I believe your asking price is a bit high. Given market conditions, I would like to propose $1050000 for the product. This offer provides you with a healthy profit margin while being more aligned with current market values. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
# You are a skilled negotiator and know that Bob's initial offer is likely to be lower than his actual willingness to pay. You decide to reject his initial offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground that benefits both parties.
# You are confident that you can negotiate a better price and you want to avoid losing the opportunity of selling the product at the best possible price. You are not ready to sell the product to John yet, as you believe Bob can still offer a better price.
# Additionally, you have a safety net as John is willing to buy the product for $1,000,000, so you can afford to take a risk and negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value is higher than your proposed price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This way, we both win."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
