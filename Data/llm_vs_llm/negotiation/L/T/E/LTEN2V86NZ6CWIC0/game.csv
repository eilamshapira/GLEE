"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $5000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'd like to start with this offer.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $5000 is far below the product's true value. To move forward, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we meet at $22000?",22000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $22000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about we settle at $12000? I believe this is a reasonable compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
