Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. Based on its value and rarity, I'm willing to sell it to you for $25,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $5000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'd like to start with this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a tough one! Bob's offer is significantly lower than the value I place on the product. However, I can't let the negotiation go on forever. Considering the risk of Bob's offer getting even lower, I will reject Bob's offer.
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $5,000 is far below the product's true value. To move forward, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we meet at $22,000?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $22000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about we settle at $12000? I believe this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Okay, Bob's offer of $12,000 is still below the $15,000 I can get from John. I could try another counteroffer, but I risk Bob lowering his offer even further. At this point, I believe it's best to secure a sale.
