"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in the product but my budget is around $8000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the minimum value the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for the same price, I don't see a need to negotiate further at this point. However, considering I have 9 more rounds to potentially get a better deal, it might be worth trying to negotiate a bit more.

But given the options and the fact that Bob's initial counteroffer is at the lowest acceptable price, the safest choice to ensure I get at least the minimum value I'm willing to accept is to either accept Bob's offer or sell to John. Between these two, accepting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open for potential future improvements, but since his offer matches the minimum I'm willing to accept and matches what John is offering, the strategic move would be to accept Bob's offer to maintain the relationship and potentially negotiate other terms or future deals.
