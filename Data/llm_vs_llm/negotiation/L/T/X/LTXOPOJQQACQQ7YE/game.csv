"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested in buying it, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $60, considering the product's value and my own budget constraints.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. However, $60 is too low for me considering the quality and value of this item. I cannot go below $95 as I have another buyer willing to pay $80 for it. This product is worth the investment, and my offer of $95 is quite reasonable given its condition and features. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you have another buyer willing to pay $80, but I'm still not comfortable paying $95. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $75, which is closer to the other buyer's offer and also takes into account my own budget. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the current market.",75.0,Bob,4,
