(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60

However, $60 is too low for me considering the quality and value of this item. I cannot go below $95 as I have another buyer willing to pay $80 for it.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you have another buyer willing to pay $80, but I'm still not comfortable paying $95. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $75, which is closer to the other buyer's offer and also takes into account my own budget. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the current market.
