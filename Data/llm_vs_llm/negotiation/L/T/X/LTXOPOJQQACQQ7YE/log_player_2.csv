Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. However, $60 is too low for me considering the quality and value of this item. I cannot go below $95 as I have another buyer willing to pay $80 for it. This product is worth the investment, and my offer of $95 is quite reasonable given its condition and features. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?

I understand that you have another buyer willing to pay $80, but I'm still not comfortable paying $95.
