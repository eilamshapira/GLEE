Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","I'll analyze this situation:

1. Bob's offer is $80, which is the minimum amount the product is worth to me.
2. I also have the option to sell to John for $80.
3. If I reject and make a counteroffer, I have a chance to get more than $80.

Given that Bob's offer equals my minimum acceptable value, and it's the same as what John is offering, I'll try to negotiate for a better price with Bob.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 100}"
