"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation. 

Alice's offer is $120, which is exactly the maximum price I'm willing to pay for the product. This happens to be the same price that Jhon is offering as well. 

Since I want to ""buy some product but save as much money as I can,"" I should try to get the product for less than $120 if possible. If I accept Alice's current offer, I pay $120. If I go with Jhon, I also pay $120. However, if I reject and make a counteroffer to Alice, there's a chance I could get it for less.

The optimal move is to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to negotiate a better price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has now offered the product for $100, which is $20 less than both her initial offer and Jhon's price. This is a better deal than what I can get from Jhon ($120).

Since my goal is to ""buy some product but save as much money as I can,"" I could try to negotiate further with Alice to get an even lower price. However, there's a risk that if I reject this offer, Alice might increase her price again or stick to a higher price in future negotiations.

Given that $100 is already a good reduction from the maximum I'm willing to pay ($120), and it's better than my alternative option (buying from Jhon), I'll accept this offer.
