"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $140. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product but I'm looking to find a price that's a bit more budget-friendly for me. Would you consider selling it for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. While $110 is above my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's room for negotiation since the product is worth $150 to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to get a better price for this product given its value. I can come down from my initial price - how about $130? This is still a good deal considering the product's market value."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your position but I still have a little flexibility. Would $115 be acceptable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $115. This is a reasonable compromise that gives me $15 more than John's guaranteed offer, and while it's less than my initial target, it's still a profitable deal. Further negotiation might risk losing the sale altogether."
