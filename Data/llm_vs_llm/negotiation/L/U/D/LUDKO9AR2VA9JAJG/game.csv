"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the product is of high quality, but my budget is more limited. I'm willing to offer $80 for the product. Let me know if we can work this out.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for this product. Given its quality and value, I cannot go below $160. This is already a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's market worth.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. While I see where you're coming from, my highest possible offer would be $100. I hope we can find a middle ground.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your offer of $100. However, I need to be transparent that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $120 for the product. I'd like to give you the opportunity to match or exceed this offer since we've been negotiating. My final counteroffer is $135, which is still below my initial price but allows me some margin above my alternative option.",135.0,Alice,5,
