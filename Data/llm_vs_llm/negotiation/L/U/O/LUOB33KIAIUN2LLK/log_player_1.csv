"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Since I have the guaranteed option to sell to John for $120, there's no reason to accept an offer that's $40 below that.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a new counteroffer in the next round, lowering my initial price somewhat but still maintaining a good margin above my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial $180, but still maintain it well above my minimum of $120 to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer has only increased by $10 from his previous offer of $80, and it's still $30 below my guaranteed sale price to John. Since I still have several rounds left for negotiation but also have the safety of John's $120 offer, there's no reason to accept an offer below my minimum price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make another counteroffer in the next round, reducing my price further but still keeping it above $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offers have been quite low, I'll make a more moderate reduction in my asking price, but still maintain it above my minimum threshold of $120.

{""product_price"": 135}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offers have only been increasing by small increments ($80, $90, $95) and remain well below my guaranteed price of $120 from John. Given that we're now in round 6 out of 10, and Bob's offers aren't approaching my minimum acceptable price quickly enough, it's becoming more logical to take the guaranteed offer from John rather than continue negotiating.
