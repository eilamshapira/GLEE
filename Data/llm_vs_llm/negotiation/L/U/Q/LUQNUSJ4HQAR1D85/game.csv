"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $1000000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential and the value I place on it.  Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $1000000 was a bit low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1400000. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  Considering your previous offer, I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $1600000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finalize the deal. ",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I have to be honest with you - I can get this product from another seller for $1500000. I'm willing to offer you that price, but I won't go any higher. If you're interested in selling to me, I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
