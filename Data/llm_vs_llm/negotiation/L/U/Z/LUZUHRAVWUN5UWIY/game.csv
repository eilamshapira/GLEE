"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm glad you see its value. However, I must say that $10000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, considering the product's worth. I'm willing to make a compromise and meet you halfway between my initial offer and your proposal. How about we settle on $13500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
