"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in your product, $15000 is beyond what I can justify for this purchase. I know I can get a similar product from another seller for $12000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $10000 for the product? This would allow me to choose you over the alternative.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understanding the value I place on this product. While $10000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $13500? This reflects the unique advantages my product offers compared to the alternative you mentioned.",13500.0,Alice,3,
