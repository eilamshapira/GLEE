"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in your product, $15000 is beyond what I can justify for this purchase. I know I can get a similar product from another seller for $12000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $10000 for the product? This would allow me to choose you over the alternative. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

While $10,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $13,500?
