"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited you're interested in my product. It's truly a unique item with significant potential benefits. I'm offering it to you for $15000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is more than the $12,000 it's worth to me, and also more than John's price of $12,000, I should not accept this offer. I have two choices: make a counteroffer to Alice or buy from John immediately.

Since John is willing to sell at $12,000 (the maximum value to me), there's no advantage in paying Alice more than that. I'll reject Alice's offer to negotiate further.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in your product, $15,000 is beyond what I can justify for this purchase. I know I can get a similar product from another seller for $12,000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $10,000 for the product? This would allow me to choose you over the alternative."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understanding the value I place on this product. While $10000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $13500? This reflects the unique advantages my product offers compared to the alternative you mentioned. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has countered with $13,500, which is still higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000). There's no reason for me to pay more than the product is worth to me, especially when I have a guaranteed alternative at a lower price.

Since John is offering the product at $12,000, which matches the maximum I'm willing to pay, I should go with that option rather than accepting Alice's higher price or continuing negotiations that might not result in a better deal.
