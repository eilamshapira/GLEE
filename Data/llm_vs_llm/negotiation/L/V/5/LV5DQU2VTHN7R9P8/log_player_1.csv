Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. I should aim to maximize my profit while considering:
1. The product is worth at least $12,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer of $12,000 from John
3. Bob's valuation is unknown, but he might value it higher than $12,000

I'll set a price significantly above my minimum to capture more value if Bob values it highly, while knowing I have John's offer as a safety net.
