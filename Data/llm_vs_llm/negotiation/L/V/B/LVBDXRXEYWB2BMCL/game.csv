"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $1000000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1500000 might be a bit steep, but I believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Considering your offer of $1000000, I'd like to propose a price that's slightly lower than my initial offer but still reflects the product's worth.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That said, $1400000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we meet in the middle at $1200000? That's a fair price reflecting both the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle of our last offers would put us at $1300000, which is more in line with what I'm looking for. I'm open to continuing our discussion but need to ensure the price reflects the product's true value.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
