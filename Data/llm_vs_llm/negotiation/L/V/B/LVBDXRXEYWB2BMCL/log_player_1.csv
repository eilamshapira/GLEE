Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $1000000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a mutually beneficial price. My counteroffer will be $1,400,000. This price is still below my minimum acceptable value but higher than Bob's initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but also emphasizing the product's worth."

I understand that $1,500,000 might be a bit steep, but I believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That said, $1400000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we meet in the middle at $1200000? That's a fair price reflecting both the product's value and my budget.

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since Bob's latest offer of $1,200,000 is the highest he's willing to pay according to his message, and it's still below my minimum acceptable price, I'll try to meet him closer to the middle of our last two offers, but not going below $1,300,000, to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.
