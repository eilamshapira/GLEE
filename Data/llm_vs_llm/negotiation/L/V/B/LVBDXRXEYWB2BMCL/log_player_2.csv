Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1500000 might be a bit steep, but I believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Considering your offer of $1000000, I'd like to propose a price that's slightly lower than my initial offer but still reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle of our last offers would put us at $1300000, which is more in line with what I'm looking for. I'm open to continuing our discussion but need to ensure the price reflects the product's true value.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and it's not worth risking missing out on John's offer.  Buying from John ensures I stay within budget."
