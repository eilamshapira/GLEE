Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what price to offer to Bob. The product is worth $150 to Bob and $100 to me. If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell it to John for $100.

Since Bob values the product at $150, I should set my price below that amount to give him an incentive to buy. If I price it too high, close to $150, Bob might reject it. If I price it at or below $100, I'm not maximizing my profit.

A reasonable strategy would be to offer the product at a price that gives Bob some surplus value while still being significantly better than my alternative option of selling to John for $100.
