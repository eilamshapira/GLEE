"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $50 is too low. I’m countering with a new price proposal – please let me know if you’re open to discussing a higher amount.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand that $200 was too high, but $50 is far below what the product is worth. How about we settle at $125? Let me know if that works for you.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down. However, $125 is still a bit high. I can offer you $75.",75.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is below what I can accept. How about $100? Let me know if you’re on board with that.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we haven't met in the middle yet. I must be upfront: I cannot go below $100, as that's the minimum value I can accept (and it's what I'm offered by another buyer). This is my best and final counteroffer. I hope we can close the deal at $100.",100.0,Alice,5,
