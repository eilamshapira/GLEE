"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,500 is lower than my minimum price of $12,000 and also lower than what I know the product is worth to him ($10,000), I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer is $11,500.

So, the decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} and I'll send the counteroffer of $11,500 to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
