"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations if you have a different valuation in mind.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the unique value of the product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9000 is a reasonable offer, I was thinking more along the lines of $10500, considering the product's unique features and value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if this is something you'd be comfortable with.",10500.0,Alice,3,
