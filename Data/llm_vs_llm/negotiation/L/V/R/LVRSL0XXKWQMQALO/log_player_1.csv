Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations if you have a different valuation in mind."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the unique value of the product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will reject Bob's offer of $9,000 because it is still relatively close to the minimum price I can sell the product for ($8,000), and I believe there is room for further negotiation to reach a higher price. I will send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a reasonable offer, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500, considering the product's unique features and value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if this is something you'd be comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
