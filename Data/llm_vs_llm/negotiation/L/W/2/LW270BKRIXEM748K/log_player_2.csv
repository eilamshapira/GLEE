"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Looking at the options:

1. Alice offers the product for $120
2. I can reject Alice's offer
3. I can buy from John for $120

Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and both Alice and John are offering the same price of $120, I'm indifferent between options 1 and 3. There's no monetary advantage to rejecting Alice's offer to buy from John instead.
