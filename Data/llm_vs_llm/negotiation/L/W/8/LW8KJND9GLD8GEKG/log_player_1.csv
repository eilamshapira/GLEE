Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product. Given its value, I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I have a budget constraint. I can offer you $8500 for the product. I hope we can reach a mutual agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Okay, considering the situation:

I want to maximize my profit, and I know the product is worth at least $8,000 to me. Bob values it at $10,000, and I originally offered $9,500. He countered with $8,500.

I can either take the $8,500, which is better than selling to John for $8,000, or I can try to negotiate further. Given that there's still room for negotiation, and Bob has already shown a willingness to go above $8,000, I will try to get a better price.

So, I choose to **Reject Bob's offer** and proceed to the next round.
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints. However, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
