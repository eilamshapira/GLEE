# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great offer for you on the product you're interested in. Considering its immense value to you, I'm offering it at a competitive price that reflects its true worth. Let me know if you're ready to make this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll analyze this offer:

- Alice is offering the product for $1,400,000
- The product is worth up to $1,500,000 to me
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $1,500,000
- My goal is to buy the product but save as much money as possible

Alice's offer saves me $100,000 compared to John's price, and it's within my maximum valuation. Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the financially optimal decision.
