"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $2,500,000 exceeds the maximum amount of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to you, and John is offering to sell the same product for exactly $1,500,000, it makes economic sense to buy from John.
