Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make an initial offer to Bob. Since I know the product is worth at least $80 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at $80, I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $80 is exactly the same as John's guaranteed offer, there's no advantage in accepting Bob's offer over selling to John. However, since Bob is willing to engage in negotiation, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I believe there's still potential to get a better price from Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial $120, but still maintain it well above my minimum acceptable price of $80 to leave room for further negotiation while trying to secure a better deal than John's offer.
