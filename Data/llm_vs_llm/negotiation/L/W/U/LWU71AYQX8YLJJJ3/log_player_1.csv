Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Let's analyze this. My floor is $800,000, so selling to John is the absolute minimum I'd accept. Bob's offer of $900,000 is better than that. I need to decide if I think I can get a better price. Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate.

Given the information, I will **reject** the offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Okay, let's analyze this again.

*   **Bob's offer:** $1,000,000
*   **My floor:** $800,000
*   **Bob's value:** $1,500,000

$1,000,000 is a good offer, but I believe there is a chance to get a better price. Since Bob's value is $1,500,000, it is possible to go for a higher price, so I will reject the offer, and send a counteroffer.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Okay, this is a crucial decision point.

*   **Bob's offer:** $1,100,000
*   **My floor:** $800,000
*   **Bob's value:** $1,500,000

$1,100,000 is a good offer, much higher than my minimum. I've been pushing for a higher price, but I also don't want to risk losing the sale. The value to Bob is still high, so I believe there is room to get more, but the risk of losing the deal is high. I'm going to risk making another counteroffer.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, I'll make one last push.

```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
