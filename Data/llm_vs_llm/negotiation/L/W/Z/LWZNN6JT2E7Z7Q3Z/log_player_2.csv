"Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Looking at the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer for $25,000 - This exceeds the maximum value of $8,000 that the product is worth to me.
2. Reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer - This would extend the negotiation, but Alice's initial offer is so high that it seems unlikely we'll reach a reasonable price.
3. Buy from John for $8,000 - This price matches the maximum value the product is worth to me.

Given that Alice's initial offer of $25,000 is more than three times the product's worth to me ($8,000), and John is offering exactly at my maximum valuation, the most rational choice is to go with John's offer.
