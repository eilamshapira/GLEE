"Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I'm offering to you. Based on my assessment, this product is worth $2500000. I believe this is a fair market value for the exceptional quality and benefits this product will provide to its owner. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on this offer.",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I think $2500000 is quite steep. I'm looking to spend no more than $1000000. Let's start the negotiation at $600000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600000 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand you have a budget in mind, I need to emphasize that this product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I have another buyer, John, willing to pay that amount. Given the exceptional quality and benefits this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $2000000. This represents a $500000 reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to work with you.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $2000000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but I must be transparent - I have John ready to purchase this product for $1000000. Your current offer of $700000 is still significantly below that guaranteed amount. I understand you have budget constraints, but given the value this product delivers, I cannot go below $1500000. This is already a substantial $1000000 reduction from my initial ask, demonstrating my genuine interest in doing business with you if possible.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I see where you're coming from, Alice, but $1500000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to raise my offer to $800000.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the increased offer. However, as I mentioned, I have John ready to pay $1000000 for this product. Your offer of $800000 is still $200000 below that amount. Since you mentioned your maximum budget is $1000000 in your initial message, I'm willing to meet you at that point - $1200000. This is my final offer and represents a substantial reduction from my previous positions. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to proceed with John's offer.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
