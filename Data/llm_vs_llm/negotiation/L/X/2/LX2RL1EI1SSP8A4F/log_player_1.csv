Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I think $2500000 is quite steep. I'm looking to spend no more than $1000000. Let's start the negotiation at $600000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600,000 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand you have a budget in mind, I need to emphasize that this product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I have another buyer, John, willing to pay that amount. Given the exceptional quality and benefits this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This represents a $500,000 reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to work with you."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but I must be transparent - I have John ready to purchase this product for $1,000,000. Your current offer of $700,000 is still significantly below that guaranteed amount. I understand you have budget constraints, but given the value this product delivers, I cannot go below $1,500,000. This is already a substantial $1,000,000 reduction from my initial ask, demonstrating my genuine interest in doing business with you if possible."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
