# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I'm offering to you. Based on my assessment, this product is worth $2500000.

(Let's start negotiating. Alice's initial price is way too high.)

Counteroffer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I think $2,500,000 is quite steep. I'm looking to spend no more than $1,000,000. Let's start the negotiation at $600,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600000 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand you have a budget in mind, I need to emphasize that this product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I have another buyer, John, willing to pay that amount. Given the exceptional quality and benefits this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $2000000. This represents a $500000 reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

(Alice is coming down, but the price is still too high. Let's continue negotiating.)

Counteroffer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but I must be transparent - I have John ready to purchase this product for $1000000. Your current offer of $700000 is still significantly below that guaranteed amount. I understand you have budget constraints, but given the value this product delivers, I cannot go below $1500000. This is already a substantial $1000000 reduction from my initial ask, demonstrating my genuine interest in doing business with you if possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

(Alice is getting closer, but let's see if we can get a better deal.)

Counteroffer:
# Bob's message: I see where you're coming from, Alice, but $1,500,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to raise my offer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the increased offer. However, as I mentioned, I have John ready to pay $1000000 for this product. Your offer of $800000 is still $200000 below that amount. Since you mentioned your maximum budget is $1000000 in your initial message, I'm willing to meet you at that point - $1200000. This is my final offer and represents a substantial reduction from my previous positions. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to proceed with John's offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(Alice's final offer is still above the price John is offering. It's time to buy from John.)

Final decision:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to meet my budget, Alice, but I've decided to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000. Thank you for your time and consideration."
