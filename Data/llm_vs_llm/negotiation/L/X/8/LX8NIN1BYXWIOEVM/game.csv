"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price of $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $600000 is below my expectations. After reevaluating the market, I'm willing to make a concession and offer the product to you for $1050000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's true value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1050000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. I'd like to propose a price of $825000. This is the highest I'm comfortable going, considering I have another option to purchase the product from John for $800000.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $825000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $950000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's true value.",950000.0,Alice,5,
