Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price of $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1050000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. I'd like to propose a price of $825000. This is the highest I'm comfortable going, considering I have another option to purchase the product from John for $800000.
