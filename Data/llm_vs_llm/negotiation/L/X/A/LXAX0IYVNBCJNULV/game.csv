"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob. However, $8000 is below my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet closer to the middle? I'm willing to go down to $13500.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering my initial offer and your counteroffer, I'd like to propose a price of $9500. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
