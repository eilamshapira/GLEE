"Hello Bob! I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional value and features, I'm offering it for $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the quality you're highlighting, but your asking price of $12000 is above my budget. I should mention that I can purchase this same product from another seller, John, for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. Would you consider $8500? This would give me some savings compared to my alternative option while still providing you with a sale.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand budget constraints, I need to point out that this product's value is significantly higher than $8500. However, I can be flexible and offer it at $10500, which is already a substantial reduction from my initial price. This price reflects the product's true value and quality, while still providing you with a considerable discount from my original offer. Would this work for you?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I should be transparent that I can purchase this exact product from John for $10000. While I'd prefer to buy from you, I can't justify paying more than what I'd pay elsewhere. I'm willing to offer $9200, which would save me some money compared to John's price while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you?",9200.0,Bob,4,
