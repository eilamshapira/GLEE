Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional value and features, I'm offering it for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the quality you're highlighting, but your asking price of $12000 is above my budget. I should mention that I can purchase this same product from another seller, John, for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. Would you consider $8500? This would give me some savings compared to my alternative option while still providing you with a sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's claim about being able to buy from John for $10,000 seems to be a negotiation tactic, as I know John is actually willing to buy from me for $8,000, not sell for $10,000. While $8,500 is above my minimum threshold of $8,000, I believe there's room for a better deal given Bob's stated willingness to work with me specifically. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand budget constraints, I need to point out that this product's value is significantly higher than $8,500. However, I can be flexible and offer it at $10,500, which is already a substantial reduction from my initial price. This price reflects the product's true value and quality, while still providing you with a considerable discount from my original offer. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I should be transparent that I can purchase this exact product from John for $10000. While I'd prefer to buy from you, I can't justify paying more than what I'd pay elsewhere. I'm willing to offer $9200, which would save me some money compared to John's price while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $9,200. While I believe Bob is bluffing about John's selling price, $9,200 is a good deal that's well above my minimum threshold of $8,000. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob as a buyer, and this price gives me a solid profit. It's better to close the deal now rather than risk further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or losing the sale altogether."
