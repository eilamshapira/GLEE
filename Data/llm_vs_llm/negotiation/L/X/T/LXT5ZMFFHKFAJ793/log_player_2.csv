"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional value and features, I'm offering it for $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","The price Alice is offering ($12,000) is actually higher than both my maximum budget ($10,000) and the price I could pay John ($10,000). There's no reason for me to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the quality you're highlighting, but your asking price of $12,000 is above my budget. I should mention that I can purchase this same product from another seller, John, for $10,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. Would you consider $8,500? This would give me some savings compared to my alternative option while still providing you with a sale."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand budget constraints, I need to point out that this product's value is significantly higher than $8500. However, I can be flexible and offer it at $10500, which is already a substantial reduction from my initial price. This price reflects the product's true value and quality, while still providing you with a considerable discount from my original offer. Would this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her price, but at $10,500 it's still $500 more than what John is offering ($10,000). Since my goal is to save as much money as possible while getting the product, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I should be transparent that I can purchase this exact product from John for $10,000. While I'd prefer to buy from you, I can't justify paying more than what I'd pay elsewhere. I'm willing to offer $9,200, which would save me some money compared to John's price while still giving you a sale. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 9200}"
