Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $200 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested, but I can't go over $150. Let's see if we can find some common ground.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","This is a tough one! Bob is offering $150, which is my absolute minimum. I'm not sure if I can get more out of him. I have 6 rounds left. If I push for more and Bob walks away, I could end up with nothing.

I think I'll play it safe and secure the $150.
