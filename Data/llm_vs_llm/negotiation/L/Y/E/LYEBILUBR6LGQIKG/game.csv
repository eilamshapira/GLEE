"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Given that I can get a similar product elsewhere for $110, I'd like to offer $105 for your product. This gives you a good profit while helping me stay within my budget. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I need to consider my costs as well. I can come down a bit from my initial offer - how about $112? This is still a good deal considering the value you'll get from this product, and it's more competitive than similar products on the market.",112.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down in price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I understand you need to consider your costs, and I respect that. How about we meet in the middle at $108? This still gives you a good profit margin while helping me get closer to my budget constraints. I'm ready to complete the purchase at this price point.",108.0,Bob,4,
