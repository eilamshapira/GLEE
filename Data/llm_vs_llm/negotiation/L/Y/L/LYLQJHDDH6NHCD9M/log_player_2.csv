 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Alice's offer is too high. It's well above my maximum budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 1000000
}

I'm starting with a strong counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and comfortably within my budget. This leaves room for negotiation while making it clear I'm seeking a fair price."

While Alice came down a bit, the offer is still too high. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm getting closer to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 1250000

I'm raising my previous offer slightly, demonstrating willingness to compromise, but keeping it significantly below her last offer and within a reasonable distance of John's price."

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""

Alice has met my bottom line, and it matches John's price.  There's no further benefit to negotiating, as I won't get a lower price from either seller."
