"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer is $12,000, which is the same price as John's offer, and it's also my maximum valuation for the product, there's no advantage in continuing the negotiation. I won't be able to get a better deal than $12,000. However, since both prices are equal, I might as well buy from Alice.
