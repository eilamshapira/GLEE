"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $25000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's quality and potential benefits. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the perceived value and rarity, $25000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to offer $8000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering the market and other alternatives available to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you see its value. However, I must say that $8000 is a bit lower than I was expecting. Considering the product's quality and the fact that I have other interested buyers, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you the product for $22000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $22000 is still too high. I understand you have other interested buyers, but I also have other options. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10000.  Let me know if this works for you. I'd like to close this deal soon.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $10000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must say that I'm still a bit short of my target price. Considering the product's value and the fact that I have a serious alternative buyer, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you the product for $18000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed. If we can't reach an agreement soon, I may need to consider other options.",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement, but $18000 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  My budget is firm. I can go up to $12000, but that's my absolute limit. If this doesn't work, I'll have to go with my alternative option. I'd prefer to buy from you, but not at that price.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for sharing your budget constraint with me. I appreciate your transparency. While $12000 is a serious offer, I'm still a bit short of my target price. Considering the product's value and the fact that I have a serious alternative buyer, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you the product for $14000, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14000 is getting close. I can offer $13000. This is my final offer.  If you accept, we have a deal. If not, I'll have to go with my other option, which is readily available at $15000.",13000.0,Bob,8,
