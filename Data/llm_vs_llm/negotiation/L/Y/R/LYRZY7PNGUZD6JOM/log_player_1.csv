"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $25,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's quality and potential benefits. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the perceived value and rarity, $25000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to offer $8000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering the market and other alternatives available to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and even lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you see its value. However, I must say that $8,000 is a bit lower than I was expecting. Considering the product's quality and the fact that I have other interested buyers, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you the product for $22,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down, but $22000 is still too high. I understand you have other interested buyers, but I also have other options. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10000.  Let me know if this works for you. I'd like to close this deal soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer of $10,000 is an improvement from his previous offer, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth and lower than what John is willing to pay. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. Since I have a better alternative with John, I'll try to get closer to that price or better."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $10,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must say that I'm still a bit short of my target price. Considering the product's value and the fact that I have a serious alternative buyer, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you the product for $18,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed. If we can't reach an agreement soon, I may need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the movement, but $18000 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  My budget is firm. I can go up to $12000, but that's my absolute limit. If this doesn't work, I'll have to go with my alternative option. I'd prefer to buy from you, but not at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer of $12,000 is an improvement from his previous offer, it's still lower than what John is willing to pay. Since Bob has stated that $12,000 is his absolute limit, I'm not sure if further negotiations will be fruitful. However, I'll try to make one more counteroffer to see if Bob is willing to stretch his budget. If not, I'll consider selling to John for the higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for sharing your budget constraint with me. I appreciate your transparency. While $12,000 is a serious offer, I'm still a bit short of my target price. Considering the product's value and the fact that I have a serious alternative buyer, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you the product for $14,000, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $14000 is getting close. I can offer $13000. This is my final offer.  If you accept, we have a deal. If not, I'll have to go with my other option, which is readily available at $15000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While Bob's offer of $13,000 is close to my target price, I have a better option with John, who is willing to pay $15,000. Since Bob has stated that $13,000 is his final offer, I don't think further negotiations will be fruitful. Additionally, Bob mentioned that his alternative option is available at $15,000, which suggests that my product is worth at least that much. Therefore, I'll choose to sell the product to John for the higher price."
