"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product at a price of $1200000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to do business, $1200000 is higher than what I'm prepared to pay for this product. The market value for similar items is lower, and I'd be comfortable with a price of $950000, which still gives you a significant profit over your cost. This would allow both of us to benefit from the transaction. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value, but I believe my product is unique and offers significant value that justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1050000.  This still allows us both to achieve a good outcome from the transaction. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. That shows we're both interested in finding common ground. However, I still feel $1050000 is on the high side. I can increase my offer to $975000, which represents a very healthy margin for you while still being a reasonable price for me. This seems like a fair compromise that would work well for both of us. What do you say?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1012500. This price is still quite fair considering the product's value to you. Let's try to reach an agreement this time. What do you think?",1012500.0,Alice,5,
