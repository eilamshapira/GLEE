Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to do business, $1200000 is higher than what I'm prepared to pay for this product. The market value for similar items is lower, and I'd be comfortable with a price of $950000, which still gives you a significant profit over your cost. This would allow both of us to benefit from the transaction. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value, but I believe my product is unique and offers significant value that justifies a higher price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. That shows we're both interested in finding common ground. However, I still feel $1050000 is on the high side. I can increase my offer to $975000, which represents a very healthy margin for you while still being a reasonable price for me. This seems like a fair compromise that would work well for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.
