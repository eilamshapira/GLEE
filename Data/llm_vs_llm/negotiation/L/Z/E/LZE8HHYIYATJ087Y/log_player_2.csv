"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given the options, here's the breakdown:

*   **Option 1: Accept Alice's offer ($11,000):** This is the cheapest option currently available and is less than your maximum willingness to pay ($12,000).
*   **Option 2: Reject Alice's offer and counteroffer:** This could lead to a better price, but also runs the risk of Alice not accepting any counteroffers and potentially ending up paying $12,000 to John, or even missing the opportunity to get the product.
*   **Option 3: Buy from John ($12,000):** This is the most expensive option.

Since I'm trying to save money, and $11,000 is less than $12,000, I should accept Alice's offer.
