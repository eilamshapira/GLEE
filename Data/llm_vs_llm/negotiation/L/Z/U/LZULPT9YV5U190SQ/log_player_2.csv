"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is close to my maximum budget of $15,000, and I want to save as much money as possible, I will choose to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I don't know Alice's bottom line, I'll start with a price that is closer to what I think the product might be worth to her, which is $8,000, but I'll add some room for negotiation.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but it's a $1,000 reduction from her previous offer, which shows she's willing to negotiate. Since I still have some room to maneuver and I want to save as much money as possible, I'll choose to reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 2, I offered $10,000, and Alice rejected it. Now, she's come back with a price of $13,000. To try to meet in the middle and make progress, I'll increase my offer, but not by too much. I'll aim for a midpoint between my previous offer and Alice's current offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price again, this time to $12,500. We're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. Considering my budget of $15,000 and the fact that Alice's offer is now only $2,500 above what I believe the product is worth to her ($8,000 + $2,500 = $10,500, but she's offering $12,500), I'm inclined to continue negotiating to see if I can get an even better deal.

However, since we're already at Round 5 and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to purchase the product at a reasonable price, I'll think carefully about my next move. Given that Alice's offer is still a bit higher than I'd ideally like to pay, but significantly lower than the $15,000 John is offering, I'll choose to reject Alice's offer once more and make another counteroffer, trying to split the difference between my last offer and Alice's current offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 5, Alice offered $12,500, and I rejected it. My previous offer was $11,500. To try to find a middle ground and encourage Alice to accept my offer, I'll increase my price slightly, aiming for a compromise between my last offer and Alice's current offer.

{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price again to $12,300, which is getting closer to my target price. Considering we're at Round 7 and I've been trying to negotiate a better price, I think it's time to assess whether continuing to negotiate will yield a significantly better result.

Given that Alice's current offer of $12,300 is only $300 above my last counteroffer of $12,000, it seems like we're very close to reaching a mutually agreeable price. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible while still acquiring the product, and Alice's offer is now very competitive with my expectations, I'll choose to accept Alice's offer of $12,300.
