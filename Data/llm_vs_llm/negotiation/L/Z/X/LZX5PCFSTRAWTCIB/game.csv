"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000, considering my budget and the product's value to me. I'd be happy to discuss further and find a mutually agreeable price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $10000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $12000, but I'd prefer to work with you. Given the product's value and quality, I can reduce my price to $13500, which is still a good deal considering its worth to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for the new proposal. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your new price. I'm willing to pay $11750 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",11750.0,Bob,4,
