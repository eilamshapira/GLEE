Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $14,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000, considering my budget and the product's value to me. I'd be happy to discuss further and find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 (which I can get from John), and I know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob. There's still room for negotiation to reach a price that's beneficial for both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $10,000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $12,000, but I'd prefer to work with you. Given the product's value and quality, I can reduce my price to $13,500, which is still a good deal considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for the new proposal. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your new price. I'm willing to pay $11750 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $12,000. Bob's offer of $11,750 is still below what John is willing to pay, and given that we're several rounds into negotiation with Bob still offering below John's price, it seems unlikely we'll reach a significantly better deal. It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John rather than risk further negotiations that might not improve."
