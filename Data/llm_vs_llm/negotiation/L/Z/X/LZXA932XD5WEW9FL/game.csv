"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $2300000.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, that price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $1100000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While that offer is significantly below my initial asking price, I'm willing to find a middle ground.  How about we settle on $1900000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and offers a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1900000 is still a bit too high for my budget. What if we split the difference from our previous offers and settled at $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer. However,  splitting the difference doesn't quite reflect the value I'm offering.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1700000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  To be honest with you, my absolute top price is $1500000. That's my final offer.  I understand if that doesn't work for you, but I'm not willing to go any higher.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
