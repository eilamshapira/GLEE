"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial $95, but not so low as to be unreasonable given that the product is worth $80 to her.

{""product_price"": 85}

This offer allows Alice to still make a small profit while giving me a better price than both her initial offer ($95) and John's alternative ($100)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $95 to $90, showing some flexibility, I'll increase my previous offer slightly but still try to get a good deal.

{""product_price"": 87}

This represents a fair middle ground between my previous offer of $85 and her current offer of $90, and still gives her a reasonable profit margin above her $80 cost."
