Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth no less than $100 to me, and Bob's offer is exactly $100, I could consider accepting it. However, I also have the option to try to negotiate a better price with Bob or sell it to John for the same price. Given that I want to earn as much money as I can for the product, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price from him.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120-$140. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $135. Let me know if that works for you!"", ""product_price"": 135}"
