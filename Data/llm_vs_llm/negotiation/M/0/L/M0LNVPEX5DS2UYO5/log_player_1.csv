Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price strategy here.

Bob values the product at $150, and I have a guaranteed fallback of $80 from John. Since Bob will reject if the price is too high, but I want to maximize my profit, I should price it below Bob's valuation but well above my minimum of $80.

A reasonable price would be $120, which gives Bob $30 in value ($150 - $120) while giving me a good profit ($40 more than my fallback option with John).
