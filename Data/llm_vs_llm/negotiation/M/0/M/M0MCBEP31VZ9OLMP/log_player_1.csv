Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I have a great product I think you'd really like. I'm offering it to you for $150."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product you have, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. How about I buy it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Okay, I need to decide if I want to sell to Bob for $90, counteroffer, or sell to John for $100. Since my minimum acceptable price is $100, I should not accept Bob's offer.

Therefore:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""new_offer"": 120}"
