"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $12000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer and make the best decision for myself.

Alice is offering the product for $12,000, while John is willing to sell it to me for $10,000. Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, I would be overpaying by $2,000 if I accepted Alice's offer.

The most economical choice is to buy from John for $10,000, which matches the maximum value of the product to me.
