"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for this product. I've done some market research, and I know I can get this product elsewhere for $100. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. Would you consider selling it for $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I must say that $70 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and my initial price, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $130, which is still a competitive price.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $130 is still more than I can justify spending. I want to be completely transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $100. I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair deal. Would you consider $85? This would be a win-win situation as you'd make a sale and I'd be happy to pay a bit more to work with you.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your transparency and for being willing to pay a bit more to work with me. I appreciate that. Considering your offer and the fact that you have another seller offering the product for $100, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and the price you mentioned. I can offer the product to you for $115, which I believe is a fair deal for both of us.",115.0,Alice,5,
