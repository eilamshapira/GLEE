Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $140. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice. That price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $90 since it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120 and I can get a guaranteed $120 from John. However, I'll try one more negotiation round with Bob before potentially selling to John.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $90 is too low for this product. I can offer it to you for $125, which is a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 125}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $90 is too low for this product. I can offer it to you for $125, which is a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Could we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and after two rounds of negotiation we're still quite far apart, I'll take the guaranteed $120 from John. This ensures I meet my minimum price requirement and avoids further negotiation that may not lead to a better outcome."
