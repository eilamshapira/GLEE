# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $140. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

I'm starting with a low offer to see how much room there is for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $90 is too low for this product. I can offer it to you for $125, which is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $120, and I want to stay below my $100 limit. This offer leaves room for one more counter-offer from either of us."
