Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my options carefully. I know the product is worth $150 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price. Bob values the product at $100.

If I offer Bob a price above $100, he will reject it since it's worth only $100 to him. If I offer Bob a price at or below $100, he might accept, but I would be selling below my guaranteed price from John.

Since I can sell to John for $150, and Bob won't pay more than $100, my best financial decision is to set a price that Bob will likely reject, allowing me to sell to John instead.
