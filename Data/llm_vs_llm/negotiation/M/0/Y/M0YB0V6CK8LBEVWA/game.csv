"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and benefits, I believe a starting price of $25000 is fair. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product sounds interesting, but $25000 is way over my budget. I'm looking for something closer to $8000. How about we start there?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the price. However, $8000 significantly undervalues the product's worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I propose $20000. This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your initial offer.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. While I appreciate it, $20000 is still too high for me. Considering I can buy it from John for $8000, I'm willing to meet you somewhere in the middle. How about $12000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, it seems like you're significantly undervaluing the product based on incorrect information. While I can't disclose details about other sellers, I can assure you that $8000 is not an accurate reflection of the market. I'm willing to come down to $17000, but that's my best and final offer.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I hear what you're saying, but $17000 is still more than I can justify. Look, I know I can get it from John for $8000. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's my final offer. Take it or leave it.",10000.0,Bob,6,
