Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and benefits, I believe a starting price of $25,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product sounds interesting, but $25000 is way over my budget. I'm looking for something closer to $8000. How about we start there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the price. However, $8,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I propose $20,000. This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your initial offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. While I appreciate it, $20000 is still too high for me. Considering I can buy it from John for $8000, I'm willing to meet you somewhere in the middle. How about $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, it seems like you're significantly undervaluing the product based on incorrect information. While I can't disclose details about other sellers, I can assure you that $8,000 is not an accurate reflection of the market. I'm willing to come down to $17,000, but that's my best and final offer."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I hear what you're saying, but $17000 is still more than I can justify. Look, I know I can get it from John for $8000. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

It's clear that Bob is either misinformed or trying to lowball.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer than John's $15,000. It's time to move on to a buyer who recognizes the true value of the product."
