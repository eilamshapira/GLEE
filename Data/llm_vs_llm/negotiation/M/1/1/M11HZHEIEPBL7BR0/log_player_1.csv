"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with an offer that's on the higher end of your acceptable range. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  Phrasing the offer in terms of ""value"" and ""potential"" helps to frame the discussion positively. 
* **Leaving Room:** Offering $1,300,000 leaves a significant gap between your asking price and both Bob's perceived value and your minimum acceptable price. This allows for concessions while still aiming for a highly profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1300000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1000000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant profit, it's still considerably lower than Bob's perceived value of the product.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher, as you yourself recognize. Let's find a middle ground: How about $1,175,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** Showing appreciation for his offer helps maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Reaffirming Value:** Gently reminding Bob of the product's high value reinforces its worth.
* **Significant Concession, Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer represents a substantial concession from our initial asking price, signaling flexibility. However, it remains closer to our starting point, aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1175000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress, and Bob is clearly willing to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is a good offer, we're still leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table. Let's push a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,150,000. This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your budget constraints."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:**  Again, acknowledging Bob's movement towards a deal helps to keep the negotiation positive.
* **Smaller Concession:** This time, we're making a smaller concession ($25,000 instead of $75,000). This signals that we're getting closer to our bottom line.
* **Justification:** We're subtly reminding Bob of the value proposition while acknowledging his stated budget concerns. 

We're aiming to land somewhere in the $1.15 million to $1.2 million range.  If Bob doesn't accept this offer or move significantly closer in the next round, we might need to consider John's offer more seriously."
