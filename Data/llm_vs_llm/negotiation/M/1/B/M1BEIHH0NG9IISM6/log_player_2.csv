"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider my options carefully here. 

Alice is offering the product at $150, which is exactly my maximum valuation and also the same price John is selling it for. This means I won't save any money by accepting Alice's current offer, and I have nothing to lose by making a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

If I make a counteroffer and Alice rejects it, I can still buy from John for $150 later, so I'm not risking anything by trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice first.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has now offered $140, which is $10 less than both her initial offer and John's price. This is a better deal, but I can still try to negotiate further down. Since I have nothing to lose by continuing to negotiate (I can always go back to John's $150 offer), I'll make another counteroffer to see if I can get an even better price.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has now offered $130, which is $20 less than her initial offer and John's price. This is an even better deal, but I still have room to negotiate. Since I can always fall back to John's $150 offer, I'll make one more counteroffer to try to get an even better price.
