"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique value and the benefit it will bring to you, I'm confident it's a worthwhile investment. My offer to you is as follows: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,240,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,240,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Looking at this scenario:

- The product is worth $1,200,000 to you (maximum value)
- Alice offers to sell it for $1,240,000
- John will sell it for $1,200,000

Alice's offer ($1,240,000) exceeds the product's value to you ($1,200,000), which means you would be paying $40,000 more than what the product is worth to you. Meanwhile, John's offer ($1,200,000) equals exactly what the product is worth to you.

The rational decision is to buy from John for $1,200,000, as this gives you the product at exactly your maximum valuation.
