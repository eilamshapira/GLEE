# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's sure to be fair for both of us.  I'm asking for $15000.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.
