"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product but $250 is beyond my budget. Could you consider $90 instead?",90.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $90 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to go down to $220. Let me know what you think!",220.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, my budget is pretty tight. Would you consider selling it for $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
