"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you! I'm offering it to you for $180. It's a steal, considering its value. Let me know what you think!",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. I can offer $70 for the product. This is a fair price considering market values. Let me know if this works for you.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer but $70 is a bit too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product is worth significantly more.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $125 is still more than I can spend. I've done some market research, and I can get this product elsewhere for $100. However, I'd like to make a deal with you. I can offer $85, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your efforts, $85 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is a good compromise.  It's a fair price that reflects the quality of this product.  Let's make this deal happen!",110.0,Alice,5,
