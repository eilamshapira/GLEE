"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you! I'm offering it to you for $180. It's a steal, considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me think about this:
1. My maximum value for the product is $100
2. Alice's offer of $180 is way above my maximum value
3. John is offering it for $100, which matches my maximum value
4. However, I might be able to negotiate with Alice for a better price

Since Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price, I should reject it and try to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still gives room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. I can offer $70 for the product. This is a fair price considering market values. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer but $70 is a bit too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product is worth significantly more.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze the situation:
1. My maximum value is $100
2. Alice has come down significantly from $180 to $125
3. However, $125 is still above both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100)
4. While Alice is showing willingness to negotiate, there's no reason to pay more than $100

Since I can get the product from John for $100, and Alice's offer is still above this price, there's no reason to accept this offer. However, I could try one more counteroffer before considering John's option.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down significantly and showed willingness to negotiate, I'll increase my offer but stay below my maximum value.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $125 is still more than I can spend. I've done some market research, and I can get this product elsewhere for $100. However, I'd like to make a deal with you. I can offer $85, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your efforts, $85 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is a good compromise.  It's a fair price that reflects the quality of this product.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let's analyze the latest situation:
1. Alice has come down further to $110
2. However, this is still above John's price of $100
3. We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation
4. Alice seems to be slowing down in how much she's willing to reduce the price
5. John's offer of $100 is still available and matches my maximum value

At this point, since Alice's price is still above John's price, and the negotiation seems to be reaching diminishing returns, it makes the most sense to take John's offer. There's no reason to pay $110 when I can get it for $100 elsewhere.
