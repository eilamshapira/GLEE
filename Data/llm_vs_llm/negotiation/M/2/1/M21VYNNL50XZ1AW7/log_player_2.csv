"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I can sell it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to analyze Alice's offer:

Alice is offering the product for $150, which is exactly the same price that John is willing to sell it for. The product is worth no more than $150 to me.

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($150), and this price is at my maximum valuation of the product, I don't gain any advantage by choosing one seller over the other.
