"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and Alice's initial offer is $100, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer.

Additionally, since I have the option to buy the product from John for $80, which is within my budget, I could consider that option as well. However, I'd like to try to negotiate with Alice first to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

So, my decision for Round 1 is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $100, and I'm looking to spend no more than $80, I'll start by making a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still reasonable.

My counteroffer is: {""product_price"": $60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $90 is still above my budget of $80. While it's a step in the right direction, I'm not willing to pay that much for the product.

Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $80, which is still within my budget, I'm inclined to reject Alice's offer again. However, I'd like to continue negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

My decision for Round 3 is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $90, and I previously offered $60, I'll try to meet Alice halfway and make a more reasonable counteroffer.

My counteroffer is: {""product_price"": $70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $85 is getting closer to my budget of $80, but it's still slightly above what I'm willing to pay.

At this point, I have to consider the option of buying the product from John for $80, which is a better deal than Alice's current offer. Since I'm running out of rounds, I need to weigh the potential benefits of continuing to negotiate with Alice against the certainty of getting the product from John at a lower price.

My decision for Round 5 is: {""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

I've decided to buy the product from John for $80, as it's the best option for me at this point."
