"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","The offer from Alice is $2,000,000, which is significantly higher than the maximum value of the product to me ($1,200,000) and also higher than John's price of $1,200,000.

Since I don't want to pay more than what the product is worth to me, and John is offering exactly at my maximum valuation, I should buy from John.
