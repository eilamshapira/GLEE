Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'd like to start with an offer of $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $100 is lower than I'm willing to accept. My next offer will be $130. This is still below the value Bob has placed on the product ($150), but closer to my initial offer. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $140 might be a bit high, but I can do $130. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you.""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $115?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as $115 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. Since Bob suggested meeting in the middle, I'll try to find a compromise that's closer to my target price. My next offer will be $125. This is slightly lower than my previous offer, but still reflects the product's value to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Meeting in the middle is a good idea, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. This way, we both get a bit closer to our target prices. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 125}"
