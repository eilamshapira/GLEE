"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $800,000 is lower than the product's worth to me and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

My counteroffer to Bob is: $1,800,000

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new offer is $1,800,000."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is still lower than what I can get from John, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

My counteroffer to Bob is: $1,500,000

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new offer is $1,500,000."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to what I can get from John, and I've already made several concessions, I think it's time to consider selling to John if I can't get a better price from Bob.

However, I'll try one more time to get a better price from Bob. If I can get him to meet me at $1,000,000, that would be ideal.

My counteroffer to Bob is: $1,000,000

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new offer is $1,000,000. If Bob rejects this, I'll likely sell to John."
