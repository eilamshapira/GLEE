Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll provide an offer to Bob for the product.

Given the situation, I should consider that:
1. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob
2. I value the product at no less than $1,000,000
3. If Bob rejects my offer, I'm guaranteed $1,000,000 from John
4. Bob will only accept if he feels he's getting a fair deal

Since both Bob and I value the product at $1,000,000, and I have a guaranteed backup offer for the same amount, I should offer Bob a price that's fair but still maximizes my return.
