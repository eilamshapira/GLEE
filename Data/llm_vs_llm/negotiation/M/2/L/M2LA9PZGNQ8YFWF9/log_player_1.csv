Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price to offer Bob.

Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob and $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I should set a price that maximizes my profit while still giving Bob enough incentive to accept.

If I set the price too close to $1,000,000, Bob might reject it since he wouldn't make any profit. If I set it too low, I'm leaving money on the table.

I'll offer a price of $920,000, which:
1. Gives me a significant premium over my $800,000 alternative
2. Leaves Bob with $80,000 in value, which should be enough incentive to accept
3. Captures most of the available surplus while still being reasonable
