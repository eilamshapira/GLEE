"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this exclusive product for $100. Let me know if you're interestedâ€”if not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $80. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer of $100 is below my maximum budget of $120, and it's also a better deal than buying from John for $120, I will choose to accept Alice's offer.
