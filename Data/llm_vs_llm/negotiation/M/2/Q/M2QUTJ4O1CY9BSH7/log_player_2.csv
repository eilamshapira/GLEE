"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $1,700,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000. I would lose money by accepting this offer. Since I have the option to buy from John for $800,000 at any time, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to Alice in the next round, trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 600000}

I'll start with a low counteroffer of $600,000. This is below my maximum value of $800,000 and gives room for negotiation. Since Alice values the product at $1,500,000, she will likely reject this offer, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation. If we can't reach an agreement that's below $800,000, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,600,000 is still way above my maximum value of $800,000. While she has reduced the price by $100,000, it's still double what I'm willing to pay. Since I have John's offer of $800,000 as a guaranteed backup, I can afford to continue negotiating. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, perhaps increasing my previous offer to show good faith in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'm increasing my offer to $700,000, which shows willingness to negotiate while still staying safely below my maximum value of $800,000. This is a $100,000 increase from my previous offer, matching Alice's $100,000 reduction in her last offer. If Alice doesn't come down to a price below $800,000 soon, I'll need to consider taking John's offer, as we have limited rounds remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll decide to buy from John now. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer of $1,550,000 is still nearly double my maximum value ($800,000)
2. The pace of Alice's price reductions is too slow (from $1,700,000 to $1,600,000 to $1,550,000)
3. Given that Alice values the product at $1,500,000, it's unlikely she'll go below that price
4. We've already used half of our negotiation rounds
5. John's offer of $800,000 is at my maximum acceptable price

It's clear that Alice and I have too large a gap to bridge, so it's best to take the guaranteed option with John rather than risk more rounds of negotiation that are unlikely to reach my target price."
