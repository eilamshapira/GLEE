"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to make a decision about Alice's offer of $1,200,000.

Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Jhon is willing to sell it for exactly $1,000,000, Alice's offer of $1,200,000 doesn't make economic sense for me to accept. It's $200,000 more than the product's maximum value to me.

I should either buy from Jhon immediately or try to negotiate with Alice for a better price. Since I have the option to buy from Jhon at any time, I can first try to negotiate with Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice that's reasonable but still beneficial for me.

{""product_price"": $850,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has lowered her price to $1,100,000, which is still above the $1,000,000 that Jhon is offering. Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and I can buy it from Jhon for exactly that amount, Alice's current offer doesn't make financial sense for me.

I'll reject Alice's offer and try one more counteroffer. If we can't reach a price below $1,000,000, I'll buy from Jhon.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $900,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has lowered her price to $1,050,000, which is still $50,000 more than Jhon's offer of $1,000,000. Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, it doesn't make financial sense to pay more than that.

At this point, I can see Alice is moving down in her price, but she's still above what I can get from Jhon. The most economical decision is to buy from Jhon.
