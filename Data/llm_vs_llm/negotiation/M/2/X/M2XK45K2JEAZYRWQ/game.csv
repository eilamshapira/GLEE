"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $150 is a bit high for me. Would you consider selling it for $100? This would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is below my minimum price. I can go as low as $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to meet a certain price point. How about we settle at $130? This is the lowest I can go while still making it work for me.",130.0,Alice,3,
