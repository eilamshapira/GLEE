You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Let's see if Alice can lower her price. The most I'm willing to pay is $1,000,000, so buying from John is still an option if Alice doesn't lower her price.)

Counteroffer: $800,000"
