"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $7000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a price that's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can make this work!",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I can appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  I could go up to $8500.  That's pushing my budget, but I'm willing to stretch a bit if we can close the deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $8500 is still far too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a chance to walk away with a good deal. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,
