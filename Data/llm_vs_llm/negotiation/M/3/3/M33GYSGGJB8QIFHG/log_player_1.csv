"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm starting with a price that I think reflects the product's value."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get a better deal. Selling to John for $12,000 is an option, but I'd like to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer a slight discount, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $11500? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. While $11,500 is closer to my target, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. Since Bob is willing to negotiate and has increased his offer, I believe there's still room to find a mutually beneficial price. Selling to John for $12,000 is still an option, but I'd like to try to get a better deal with Bob. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to my limit, but I can try to meet you in the middle again. How about $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to my limit, but I can try to meet you in the middle again. How about $13,000? I'm trying to be flexible, but I also need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we both want to make this work.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $12250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $12,250 is higher than my minimum acceptable price and also higher than what John is willing to pay ($12,000). Since we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, I think it's a good idea to accept this offer and close the deal. It's a fair price, and I'm earning more than my minimum requirement."
