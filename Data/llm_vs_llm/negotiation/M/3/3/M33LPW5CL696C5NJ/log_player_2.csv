"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Based on the information provided, I should make a decision that maximizes my economic benefit.

The product is worth no more than $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $200, which exceeds its value to me by a significant amount.

John is offering the same product for $80, which matches the maximum value I place on the product.

Therefore, I should reject Alice's offer and buy from John instead.
