Send your offer to Bob.,"After considering my situation, I need to set a price that balances my chance of selling to Bob while ensuring I get more than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll offer a price that represents a reasonable markup from my minimum value, but not so high that it would immediately deter most buyers.
