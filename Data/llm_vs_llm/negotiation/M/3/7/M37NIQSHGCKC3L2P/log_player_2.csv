"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be perfect for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth, and I believe it would be a valuable investment for you. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since Alice's offer is $12,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay, there's no benefit to accepting it. I can buy the product from John for the same price.  Rejecting Alice's offer doesn't change the final price."
