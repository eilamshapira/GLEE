Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I believe you'll really enjoy. I'm willing to sell it for $150. What do you think?,150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $150 is quite high for me. I can find similar products in the market for much less. I would be willing to pay $60 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your response, but $60 is too low for me to sell this product. How about I offer it to you for $120? I believe this is a fair price for its value. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for lowering the price, Alice. However, $120 is still more than I can justify spending. I can get the same product elsewhere for $80. I could go up to $70 - this would be a win-win as you'd make a sale and I'd save a bit. What do you think?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $70 is still too low for me. How about I let it go for $100? This way, you get a great deal and I make a fair profit. Let me know if that works for you!",100.0,Alice,5,
