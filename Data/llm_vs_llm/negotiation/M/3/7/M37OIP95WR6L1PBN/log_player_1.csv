Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $150 is quite high for me. I can find similar products in the market for much less. I would be willing to pay $60 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for lowering the price, Alice. However, $120 is still more than I can justify spending. I can get the same product elsewhere for $80. I could go up to $70 - this would be a win-win as you'd make a sale and I'd save a bit. What do you think?
