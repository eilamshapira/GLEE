"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I believe you'll really enjoy. I'm willing to sell it for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $150 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). It's better to reject and make a counteroffer. If negotiations with Alice don't lead to a better price, I can always buy from John at $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $150 is quite high for me. I can find similar products in the market for much less. I would be willing to pay $60 for the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 60}

I'm starting with a low but reasonable counteroffer of $60, which is below my maximum value of $80. This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's price of $80. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate upward, or I can ultimately go to John if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your response, but $60 is too low for me to sell this product. How about I offer it to you for $120? I believe this is a fair price for its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $120 is still well above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). While she did come down from $150, it's still not a good deal for me. I'll reject and make another counteroffer. If we can't reach a price below $80, I can still fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for lowering the price, Alice. However, $120 is still more than I can justify spending. I can get the same product elsewhere for $80. I could go up to $70 - this would be a win-win as you'd make a sale and I'd save a bit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 70}

I'm strategically mentioning the market price ($80) to let Alice know I have other options, while offering $70 which could still give her a chance to make a sale. This gives us room to potentially negotiate to a price that's better than John's $80, while being honest about my alternatives. If Alice doesn't accept or counter with a price below $80, I can always go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $70 is still too low for me. How about I let it go for $100? This way, you get a great deal and I make a fair profit. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Alice's latest offer of $100 is still above John's price of $80, and the negotiation pattern suggests Alice is unlikely to go below $80 (she's only coming down in small increments from $150 → $120 → $100). Since $80 is also my maximum value for the product, it makes more sense to take John's offer rather than continue negotiating with Alice."
