"Alice,  $2100000 is far above my budget for this product. I'm very interested in purchasing it, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I must decline your offer of $800000. This product represents significant value, and I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay $1500000. However, I'd like to give you the opportunity to purchase it since you've expressed interest. My minimum acceptable price is $1500000, which matches my alternative offer. I cannot go below this amount as it represents the product's minimum value to me.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
