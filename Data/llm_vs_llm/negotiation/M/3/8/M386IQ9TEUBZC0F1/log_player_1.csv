Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2100000 is far above my budget for this product. I'm very interested in purchasing it, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I must decline your offer of $800,000. This product represents significant value, and I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay $1,500,000. However, I'd like to give you the opportunity to purchase it since you've expressed interest. My minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000, which matches my alternative offer.
