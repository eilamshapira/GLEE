Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I must decline your offer of $800000. This product represents significant value, and I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay $1500000. However, I'd like to give you the opportunity to purchase it since you've expressed interest. My minimum acceptable price is $1500000, which matches my alternative offer. I cannot go below this amount as it represents the product's minimum value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
