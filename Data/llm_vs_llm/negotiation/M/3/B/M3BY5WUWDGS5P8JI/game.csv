"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm offering to you first before considering other buyers. This product is valued at $18000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $16500. This is an excellent opportunity as the product offers substantial value. Are you interested in this offer?",16500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, the product's value is not quite aligning with my budget. I'm prepared to offer $14000 for the product.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $14000. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, my initial price already represented a significant discount from the product's true market value. I can come down to $15500, which still provides you with excellent value while allowing me to cover my costs. This is a fair compromise that works for both of us. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks again, Alice. I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, my absolute maximum is $15000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",15000.0,Bob,4,
