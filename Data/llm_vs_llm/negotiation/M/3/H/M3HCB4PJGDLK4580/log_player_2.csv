"Alice's offer: The product price will be $149. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $149
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $100 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $149
3. John is willing to sell it for $100

Since Alice's offer ($149) is:
- Higher than what the product is worth to me ($100)
- Higher than John's price ($100)

It wouldn't make economic sense to accept Alice's offer. Since John is offering the product at exactly what it's worth to me ($100), and it's significantly cheaper than Alice's offer, the best decision would be to buy from John.
