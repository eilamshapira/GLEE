Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob for the product.

Looking at the situation, I have a product worth at least $80 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at exactly $80. This gives me a safety net of $80. When offering to Bob, I need to balance between making more profit than my guaranteed $80 and keeping the price attractive enough that Bob might accept.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll price it higher than my minimum acceptable value but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected.
