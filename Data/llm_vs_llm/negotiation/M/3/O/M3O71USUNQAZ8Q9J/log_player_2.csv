"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer ($120) is higher than both my maximum valuation ($100) and John's price ($100), it wouldn't be rational to accept Alice's offer. John's price is equal to my maximum valuation, and it's a guaranteed option.
