Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about a strategic price for this situation.

Given that:
1. My minimum acceptable price is $150 (as I can sell to John for this amount)
2. I don't know Bob's maximum willingness to pay
3. I only have one chance to make an offer to Bob

I'll set a price significantly above my minimum to maximize my potential profit, while keeping it in a reasonable range that could still be acceptable to a buyer.
