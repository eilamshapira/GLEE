,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for me, especially since I know I can get this product elsewhere for $100. I value our potential deal, but I would need a more competitive price. Would you consider selling it for $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $80 is below my minimum selling price. I'm willing to lower my price to $120, which is a significant discount from my original offer. Let me know if this works for you.",120.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the discount I'm offering. Let me know if this works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
