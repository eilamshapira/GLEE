"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know if you'd like to take it at this price!"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for me, especially since I know I can get this product elsewhere for $100. I value our potential deal, but I would need a more competitive price. Would you consider selling it for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $80 is below my minimum selling price. I'm willing to lower my price to $120, which is a significant discount from my original offer. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110?
