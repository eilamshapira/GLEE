"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. Given its high quality and value, I'm pricing it at $95. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll agree.",95.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I think $95 is a bit steep. Given the market value and similar products I've seen, I'd be comfortable paying $85 for it. This would still give you a fair profit while being a more reasonable price for me. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $92. This price still gives you a great deal while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. I'm still finding $92 a bit high for my budget though. How about we meet in the middle at $88? That gives you a good profit margin while helping me stay within my budget constraints. I'm ready to make the purchase immediately at this price.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your willingness to meet in the middle. I appreciate your eagerness to make the purchase. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I was thinking of $90 as the lowest I can go. This price still gives you a great deal, and I'm confident we can finalize the sale at this point.",90.0,Alice,5,
