Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I think $95 is a bit steep. Given the market value and similar products I've seen, I'd be comfortable paying $85 for it. This would still give you a fair profit while being a more reasonable price for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. I'm still finding $92 a bit high for my budget though. How about we meet in the middle at $88? That gives you a good profit margin while helping me stay within my budget constraints. I'm ready to make the purchase immediately at this price.
