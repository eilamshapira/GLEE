"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. Given its high quality and value, I'm pricing it at $95. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll agree. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice is offering the product for $95, which is below the maximum value of $100 for me. However, I know the product is only worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. John's fixed price of $100 is my fallback option, but it's higher than Alice's current offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better price.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I think $95 is a bit steep. Given the market value and similar products I've seen, I'd be comfortable paying $85 for it. This would still give you a fair profit while being a more reasonable price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $92. This price still gives you a great deal while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has countered with $92, which is lower than her initial offer of $95 and still below my maximum value of $100. This is also better than John's price of $100. However, since I know the product is worth $80 to Alice, there might still be room to negotiate a slightly better price.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. I'm still finding $92 a bit high for my budget though. How about we meet in the middle at $88? That gives you a good profit margin while helping me stay within my budget constraints. I'm ready to make the purchase immediately at this price."", ""product_price"": 88}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your willingness to meet in the middle. I appreciate your eagerness to make the purchase. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I was thinking of $90 as the lowest I can go. This price still gives you a great deal, and I'm confident we can finalize the sale at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has now offered $90, which is lower than her previous offers of $95 and $92. This is a $10 reduction from her initial price and is well below John's fixed price of $100. 

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has already come down significantly from her initial offer, and she's indicating this is close to her bottom line. The product is worth $80 to her, so at $90 she's making a reasonable profit while I'm getting a price that's still $10 below my maximum value.

I think this is a fair compromise, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.
