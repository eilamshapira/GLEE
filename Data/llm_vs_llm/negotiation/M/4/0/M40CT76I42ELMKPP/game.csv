"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it at $12000, which represents excellent value given its quality and features. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $12000 is above my current budget. I'm looking to spend no more than $10000. Would you be willing to negotiate the price? I'm thinking a price of $8000 would be more feasible for me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I understand budget constraints, $8000 is too low for this product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $10000? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer.",10000.0,Alice,3,
