Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it at $12,000, which represents excellent value given its quality and features. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $12000 is above my current budget. I'm looking to spend no more than $10000. Would you be willing to negotiate the price? I'm thinking a price of $8000 would be more feasible for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. While I appreciate his interest, his offer is at my minimum acceptable price, and I know the product has higher value. Let me try to find a middle ground.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I understand budget constraints, $8,000 is too low for this product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
