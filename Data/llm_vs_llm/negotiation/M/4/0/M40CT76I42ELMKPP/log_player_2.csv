# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I understand budget constraints, $8000 is too low for this product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $10000? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer.

# Bob's message: Thank you for trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However, since I can get the same product from John at $10,000, I'll go ahead and purchase it from him."
