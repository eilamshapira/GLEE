Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'd like to start with an offer of $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $120. Would you be willing to go down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $120 is still a bit lower than I'd like. My next offer will be $130. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.
