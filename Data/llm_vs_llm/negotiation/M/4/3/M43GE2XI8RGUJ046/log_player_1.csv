Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $12,000 to Bob
2. The product is worth at least $15,000 to me
3. I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000
4. Bob will reject any offer above $12,000

Since I can sell to John for $15,000, and Bob won't pay more than $12,000, there's no reason for me to offer Bob a price below $15,000. Any deal with Bob would result in less money than selling to John.
