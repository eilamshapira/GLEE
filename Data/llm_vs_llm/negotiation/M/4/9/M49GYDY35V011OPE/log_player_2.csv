"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my premium product for $12000. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward or if you have a different figure in mind. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is too high. It's significantly more than John's price. We should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. That's a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We want to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards.  A significantly lower counteroffer might incentivize Alice to meet us closer to our desired price range. 
* **Polite and Open:** We maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable.  We don't want to offend Alice and risk her walking away from the deal altogether. 

Let's see how Alice responds to this counteroffer."
