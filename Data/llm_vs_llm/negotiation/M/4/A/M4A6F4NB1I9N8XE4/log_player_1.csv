Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider the optimal price to offer Bob. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll still get $150 from John, so I shouldn't go below that value. However, since I don't know Bob's maximum willingness to pay, I should aim higher while keeping the offer reasonable enough that Bob might accept.
