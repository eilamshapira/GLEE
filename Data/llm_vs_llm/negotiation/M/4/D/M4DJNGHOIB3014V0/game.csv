"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to consider that?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer! I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $180 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $140, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to consider that?",140.0,Bob,4,
