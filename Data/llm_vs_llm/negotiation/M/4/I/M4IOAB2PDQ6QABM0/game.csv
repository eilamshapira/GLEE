"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12000 is significantly above my budget. Given market conditions and my research, I can only offer $7500 for the product. This is a fair price that would still provide you with value while meeting my budget constraints.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your response. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be clear that this product is worth no less than $10000 to me. After considering your position, I can come down to $10500, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects the true value of the product while still providing you with a quality investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,
