{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its features and value, I'm offering it at $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's capabilities and market value."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12000 is significantly above my budget. Given market conditions and my research, I can only offer $7500 for the product. This is a fair price that would still provide you with value while meeting my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
