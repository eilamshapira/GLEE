"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its features and value, I'm offering it at $12000. This is a competitive price considering the product's capabilities and market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: The current offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative offer ($8,000). It would not be rational to accept this offer as it would result in a loss for me. Since Alice's cost is $10,000, there might be room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If we can't reach an agreement, I always have the option to buy from John at $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12,000 is significantly above my budget. Given market conditions and my research, I can only offer $7,500 for the product. This is a fair price that would still provide you with value while meeting my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 7500}

Reasoning: I'm starting with an offer of $7,500 which is:
1. Below my maximum value ($8,000)
2. Below John's price ($8,000)
3. Lower than Alice's cost ($10,000), giving room for negotiation

While this offer is below Alice's cost, it's a strategic starting point for negotiation. I expect Alice to counter with a higher price, and we can potentially meet somewhere in the middle. If the negotiation doesn't progress favorably, I still have the option to buy from John at $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your response. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be clear that this product is worth no less than $10000 to me. After considering your position, I can come down to $10500, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects the true value of the product while still providing you with a quality investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Reasoning: At this point, it's clear that continuing negotiations with Alice may not be productive because:
1. Alice has stated the product is worth no less than $10,000 to her
2. This is above my maximum value of $8,000
3. She's only willing to come down to $10,500, which is still well above both my maximum value and John's price
4. Given that her cost is $10,000, she's unlikely to go below that price

Since John is offering the product at $8,000, which is exactly my maximum value, it makes the most sense to take this guaranteed option rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to result in a better deal. John's offer is the most economically rational choice in this situation."
