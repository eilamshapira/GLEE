"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to consider what's best for me here. Alice is offering the product for $100, and she claims it's worth more to her. John is also willing to sell me the same product for $100.

Since both offers are for the exact same price ($100), and this price is exactly at my maximum value threshold, I don't save any money by choosing one seller over the other. I might as well accept Alice's offer since she's already presented it to me.
