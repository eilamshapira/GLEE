"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget considerations. However, given the quality and value of this product, I cannot go as low as $9000. I can offer it to you for $10500, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a fair price that reflects the product's true value. Would you be willing to meet me at this price point?",10500.0,Alice,3,
