Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let me make a counteroffer to Bob between $9,000 and $12,000 to try to reach a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget considerations. However, given the quality and value of this product, I cannot go as low as $9,000. I can offer it to you for $10,500, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a fair price that reflects the product's true value. Would you be willing to meet me at this price point?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
