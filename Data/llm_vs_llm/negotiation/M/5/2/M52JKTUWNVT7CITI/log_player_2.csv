"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,200,000 (which is also John's price). It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer when I can either negotiate for a better price or ultimately buy from John for $1,200,000. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 900000}

I'll make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000, which gives me room for negotiation. If Alice counters with a price between $900,000 and $1,200,000, I might still get a better deal than buying from John. If Alice rejects and comes back with a price still above $1,200,000, I can always go to John as my backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,350,000 is still higher than John's price of $1,200,000. While Alice has reduced the price from her initial offer, it still doesn't make financial sense to accept this price when I can either:
1. Continue negotiating for a better price, or
2. Buy from John for $1,200,000

I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round. Since Alice has shown willingness to reduce the price, there might be room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'll increase my previous offer to $1,000,000. This shows some movement from my previous offer of $900,000, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate, while still keeping the price well below John's price of $1,200,000. This gives Alice room to counter while potentially allowing me to secure a better deal than John's price. If Alice still insists on a price above $1,200,000, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still $50,000 higher than John's price of $1,200,000. While Alice has significantly reduced her price from the initial $1,500,000, it's still not a better deal than what John is offering. Since Alice has shown consistent willingness to lower the price, I'll reject and make one more counteroffer. If we can't reach a price below $1,200,000 in the next round or two, I'll switch to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'll increase my offer to $1,100,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer of $1,000,000, showing that I'm seriously trying to meet Alice partway. It's still $100,000 below John's price, which would represent meaningful savings if Alice accepts. Alice has shown willingness to reduce her price throughout the negotiation, moving from $1,500,000 to $1,250,000. If Alice doesn't accept this or counter with a price below $1,200,000, I may need to consider taking John's offer in the next rounds to ensure I secure the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $1,200,000. This price is exactly the same as John's offer, and Alice has finally come down to a price that matches my maximum value. While we could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice would go lower, and we risk her potentially increasing the price again. Given that we've reached a price equal to my alternative option (John's price), and considering we've already spent several rounds negotiating, it's reasonable to accept this offer and conclude the deal."
