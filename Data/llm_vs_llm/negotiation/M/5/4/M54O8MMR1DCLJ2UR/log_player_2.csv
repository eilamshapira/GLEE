"Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","The product is worth no more than $80 to me, but Alice is offering it for $170, which exceeds my value for the product. Since John is willing to sell the product for exactly $80 (which matches my maximum valuation), it makes financial sense to buy from John instead.
