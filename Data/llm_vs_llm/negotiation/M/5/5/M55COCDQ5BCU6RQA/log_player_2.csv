"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that has immense value. I am offering it to you for $1200000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Looking at the offer:

Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000.
The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me.
John is willing to sell the same product for $800,000.

Since Alice's price ($1,200,000) exceeds both the product's value to me ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000), the best decision is to buy from John.
