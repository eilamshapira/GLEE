"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're offering, I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. Your price of $1150000 is quite close to the $1200000 I could pay elsewhere. Considering that the product costs you $1000000, I'd like to propose a price of $1075000, which gives you a healthy profit while allowing me to save more compared to my alternative option. This creates a win-win situation for both of us. What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $1075000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price of $1000000. I need to ensure I'm making a reasonable profit on this transaction. I can come down to $1125000, which still gives you a $75000 discount from the product's value to you while providing me with a fair return. This is a win-win that more equitably splits the potential value between us.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
