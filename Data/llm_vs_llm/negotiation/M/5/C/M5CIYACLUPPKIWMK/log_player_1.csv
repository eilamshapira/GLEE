Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're offering, I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. Your price of $1150000 is quite close to the $1200000 I could pay elsewhere. Considering that the product costs you $1000000, I'd like to propose a price of $1075000, which gives you a healthy profit while allowing me to save more compared to my alternative option. This creates a win-win situation for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $1,075,000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I need to ensure I'm making a reasonable profit on this transaction. I can come down to $1,125,000, which still gives you a $75,000 discount from the product's value to you while providing me with a fair return. This is a win-win that more equitably splits the potential value between us."", ""product_price"": 1125000}"
