"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for a price of $150. Let me know if you're interested!",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is quite a bit higher than what I'm looking to spend for this product. I've actually found the same product from another seller for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. I'm willing to offer $65 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $65 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet somewhere in the middle here to make it work for both of us. How about we settle at $130? I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, $130 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I can purchase this same product from another seller for $80, but I'd rather buy from you if possible. To make it worth your while, I can offer $70. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to the other seller. How does that sound?",70.0,Bob,4,
