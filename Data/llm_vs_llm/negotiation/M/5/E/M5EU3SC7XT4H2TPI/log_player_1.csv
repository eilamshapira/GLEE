Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is quite a bit higher than what I'm looking to spend for this product. I've actually found the same product from another seller for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. I'm willing to offer $65 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, $130 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I can purchase this same product from another seller for $80, but I'd rather buy from you if possible. To make it worth your while, I can offer $70. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to the other seller. How does that sound?
