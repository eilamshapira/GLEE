"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for a price of $150. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to consider my options carefully here. Alice is offering me a product for $150, but it's only worth up to $80 to me. I also know I can buy the same product from John for $80 at any time.

Since the current offer of $150 is well above my maximum value for the product, and also above my alternative option, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is quite a bit higher than what I'm looking to spend for this product. I've actually found the same product from another seller for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. I'm willing to offer $65 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 65}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $65 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet somewhere in the middle here to make it work for both of us. How about we settle at $130? I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has come down from $150 to $130, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but this price is still significantly above both my maximum value for the product ($80) and my alternative option of buying from John for $80.

Since I can get the exact same product from John for $80, there's no reason for me to pay Alice $130. I should reject this offer and continue negotiating.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, $130 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I can purchase this same product from another seller for $80, but I'd rather buy from you if possible. To make it worth your while, I can offer $70. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to the other seller. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 70}"
