Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider the price I'm offering to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I have John as a guaranteed buyer at that price, I should set my offer to Bob above this minimum value.

Bob's willingness to pay is unknown to me. If I set the price too high, Bob might reject it, and I'll end up selling to John for $1,000,000. If I set it just right, I could make more than my minimum acceptable amount.

Given that I have a guaranteed fallback option, I can afford to be somewhat aggressive in my pricing to Bob, aiming to capture additional value if Bob's willingness to pay is higher than my minimum.
