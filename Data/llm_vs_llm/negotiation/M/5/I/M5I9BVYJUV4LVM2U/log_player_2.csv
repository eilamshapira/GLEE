"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to offer you my product for $120. It's a great value and I think you'll be very happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $120 is a decent price, there's a chance I could get it for even less. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It looks like a nice product, but I was hoping to spend a bit less. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer ($90) gives me room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below John's $150 price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that you're looking for a better deal. I can come down to $100. This is a great value for the product. How does that sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is negotiating, which is good. There's still room between $100 and my budget. I'll try to meet her halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you being flexible, Alice.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $95? That would work well for me."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**  A counter-offer of $95 is a fair compromise and keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a lower price."
