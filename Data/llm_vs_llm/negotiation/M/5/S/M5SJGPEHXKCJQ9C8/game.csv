"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit high for me. Given the market value, I'd be comfortable paying $95 for it. This gives you a good profit margin while allowing me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest, but I canâ€™t go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. I can go up from my initial offer - how about $100? That's a $20 profit for you, which is a solid 25% return on your cost. This feels like a fair middle ground between our positions.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I believe the product is worth a bit more. How about $105? That way, we both benefit from the deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
