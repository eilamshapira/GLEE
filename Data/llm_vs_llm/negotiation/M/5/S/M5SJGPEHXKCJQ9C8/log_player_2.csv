"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this product for $120. I believe it will be a great value for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll analyze this situation:

- The product is worth at most $150 to me
- Alice is offering it for $120
- I can buy from John for $150
- The product is worth $80 to Alice, so she has room to go lower

Alice's offer of $120 is below my maximum value, but I think I can negotiate a better price since it's only the first round and the item costs Alice just $80.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit high for me. Given the market value, I'd be comfortable paying $95 for it. This gives you a good profit margin while allowing me to stay within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest, but I canâ€™t go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll analyze Alice's counteroffer:

- Alice has come down from $120 to $110
- This is still well below my maximum value of $150
- Alice's cost is $80, so she's making a $30 profit at $110
- We still have 7 more potential rounds to negotiate
- John's price of $150 remains an option but is significantly higher

Alice has moved toward my price, which is good, but I think there's still room to negotiate further since we're only in round 3.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. I can go up from my initial offer - how about $100? That's a $20 profit for you, which is a solid 25% return on your cost. This feels like a fair middle ground between our positions."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I believe the product is worth a bit more. How about $105? That way, we both benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll analyze this latest offer:

- Alice has come down from $110 to $105
- We're getting closer to meeting in the middle
- At $105, Alice still makes a $25 profit (31% over her cost)
- We're now at round 5 of 10, so we're halfway through our negotiation window
- $105 is significantly better than John's $150 offer

Alice has shown flexibility by coming down in price twice now. The current offer of $105 is reasonable and significantly below my maximum value. Since we're halfway through our rounds and the price difference is now only $5 from my last offer, I'll accept.
