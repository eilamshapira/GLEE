"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Based on the offer from Alice, I should evaluate whether it makes sense for me.

Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is $200,000 less than what John is selling it for ($1,200,000) and also below my maximum valuation ($1,200,000).

This is actually a good offer since:
1. It's below my maximum value for the product
2. It's significantly better than the alternative of buying from John
3. There's no guarantee I could negotiate a better price with a counteroffer
