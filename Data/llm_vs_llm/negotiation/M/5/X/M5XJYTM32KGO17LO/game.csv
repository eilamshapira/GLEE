"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $12000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider selling it for $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but $10000 is a bit lower than what I can accept given the product's value. I can come down to $11200, which I believe is a fair compromise. This product is worth the investment, and I'm already offering you a significant discount from my initial price.",11200.0,Alice,3,
