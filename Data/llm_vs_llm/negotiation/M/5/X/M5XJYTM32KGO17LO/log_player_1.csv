(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

I understand you're looking for a better price, but $10,000 is a bit lower than what I can accept given the product's value. I can come down to $11,200, which I believe is a fair compromise. This product is worth the investment, and I'm already offering you a significant discount from my initial price."", ""product_price"": 11200}"
