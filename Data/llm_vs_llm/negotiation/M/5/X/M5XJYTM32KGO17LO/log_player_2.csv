Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but $10000 is a bit lower than what I can accept given the product's value. I can come down to $11200, which I believe is a fair compromise. This product is worth the investment, and I'm already offering you a significant discount from my initial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200.
