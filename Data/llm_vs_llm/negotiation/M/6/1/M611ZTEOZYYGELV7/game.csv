"Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well. I'm offering you a unique product that I believe would be of value to you. While I have another interested buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1200000, I wanted to give you the first opportunity to acquire it. My asking price is $1100000. This represents a $100000 savings compared to what I could sell it for elsewhere, offering you a chance to secure this product at a favorable price.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for considering my counteroffer, Alice. Based on my budget and the value this product brings to me, I'm willing to purchase it for $600000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your counteroffer. However, I need to be transparent that $600000 is significantly below what I can accept. The product is worth no less than $1200000 to me, which is why John is willing to pay that amount. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. My counteroffer is $950000, which represents a substantial $250000 discount from what I could otherwise receive. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire the product at a considerable savings.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for considering my previous offer. I understand that we're still a bit apart on the price, so I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I hope it shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your willingness to work toward an agreement. While $700000 shows progress, it still falls significantly below what makes economic sense for me, considering I have a guaranteed $1200000 from John. However, I value the opportunity to work with you and am willing to meet you part way. My counteroffer is $875000. This represents a substantial $325000 discount from my alternative option, which is a significant value opportunity for you. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,5,
