# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my counteroffer, Alice. Based on my budget and the value this product brings to me, I'm willing to purchase it for $600000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

However, I need to be transparent that $600,000 is significantly below what I can accept. The product is worth no less than $1,200,000 to me, which is why John is willing to pay that amount. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. My counteroffer is $950,000, which represents a substantial $250,000 discount from what I could otherwise receive.
