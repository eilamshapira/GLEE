"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well. I'm offering you a unique product that I believe would be of value to you. While I have another interested buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1200000, I wanted to give you the first opportunity to acquire it. My asking price is $1100000. This represents a $100000 savings compared to what I could sell it for elsewhere, offering you a chance to secure this product at a favorable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but I'm looking for a better deal. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. Would you consider this counteroffer?"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your counteroffer. However, I need to be transparent that $600000 is significantly below what I can accept. The product is worth no less than $1200000 to me, which is why John is willing to pay that amount. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. My counteroffer is $950000, which represents a substantial $250000 discount from what I could otherwise receive. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire the product at a considerable savings.

# Bob's message:
Thanks for getting back to me, Alice. I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. Hope we can find some middle ground."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your willingness to work toward an agreement. While $700000 shows progress, it still falls significantly below what makes economic sense for me, considering I have a guaranteed $1200000 from John. However, I value the opportunity to work with you and am willing to meet you part way. My counteroffer is $875000. This represents a substantial $325000 discount from my alternative option, which is a significant value opportunity for you. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.

Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but I've decided to proceed with purchasing the product from John for $800,000. Thank you for your time and consideration."
