You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer matches my maximum budget, there's no reason to settle immediately.  There's a chance I could get a better price by negotiating. I'll try a counteroffer significantly lower than $12,000 to gauge Alice's potential flexibility."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice lowering her price to $10,000 suggests she's willing to negotiate.  I'm aiming to be closer to $8,000, so I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer."
