Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob, designed to start high but with room for negotiation, considering my bottom line of $80:

```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer of $50 is way too low. I would lose money. And I know I can sell to John for $80, so I won't accept a price below that.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, I rejected Bob's lowball offer. Now I need to counter with something reasonable that still gets me a good profit, but also shows I'm willing to negotiate. Let's try this:

```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, Bob is still significantly below my minimum. Selling to John for $80 is starting to look more appealing. However, let's try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, time to try to meet him in the middle, but stay above my minimum.

```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob is getting closer, but still below my minimum. However, the gap is closing. I need to decide if the potential of a slightly higher offer from Bob is worth more than the guaranteed $80 from John, considering the risk of Bob walking away. At this point, I will go with John.
