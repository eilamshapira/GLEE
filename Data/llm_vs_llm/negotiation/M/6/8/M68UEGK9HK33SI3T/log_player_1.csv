Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer is equal to my minimum acceptable price (and the same as John's offer), there's no advantage in accepting it immediately. I'll reject and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.
