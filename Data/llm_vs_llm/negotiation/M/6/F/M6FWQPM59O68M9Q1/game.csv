"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I can't go as high as $15000. I've actually received an offer from another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $12000. I value this product at $12000, so I'd need a better price to consider purchasing from you. Would you be willing to go down to $11000? This would give me an incentive to buy from you rather than from John.",11000.0,Bob,2,
