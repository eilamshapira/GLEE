"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I can't go as high as $15000. I've actually received an offer from another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $12000. I value this product at $12000, so I'd need a better price to consider purchasing from you. Would you be willing to go down to $11000? This would give me an incentive to buy from you rather than from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
