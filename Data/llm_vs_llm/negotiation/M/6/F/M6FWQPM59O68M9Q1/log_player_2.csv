"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you our incredible product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $15,000, I need to evaluate if this is a good deal.

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and I know I can buy it from John for exactly $12,000. Alice's current price of $15,000 is $3,000 higher than my maximum value and higher than my alternative option.

Since Alice's offer exceeds both my maximum valuation and my alternative option, I should reject this offer and either make a counteroffer or buy from John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I can't go as high as $15,000. I've actually received an offer from another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $12,000. I value this product at $12,000, so I'd need a better price to consider purchasing from you. Would you be willing to go down to $11,000? This would give me an incentive to buy from you rather than from John."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
