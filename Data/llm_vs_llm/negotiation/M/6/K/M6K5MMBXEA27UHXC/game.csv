"Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1400000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential value.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1400000 is a bit too high for me.  Given my budget, I can only offer $1000000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product's market value and quality justify a higher price. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1300000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000 for the product.  This represents a significant increase from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price given its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
