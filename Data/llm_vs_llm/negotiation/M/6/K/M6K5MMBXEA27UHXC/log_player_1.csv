"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential value."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1400000 is a bit too high for me.  Given my budget, I can only offer $1000000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is too low as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Since we still have several rounds to negotiate and I always have the option to sell to John at $1,200,000, I'll try to negotiate with Bob for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product's market value and quality justify a higher price. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000 for the product.  This represents a significant increase from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $1,200,000. Bob's highest offer of $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, it's unlikely he'll increase his offer above $1,200,000. Therefore, it's best to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John rather than continue negotiations with Bob."
