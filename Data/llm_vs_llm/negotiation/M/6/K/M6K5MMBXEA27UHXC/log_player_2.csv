Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product's market value and quality justify a higher price. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1300000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product.  This represents a significant increase from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price given its value to me."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
