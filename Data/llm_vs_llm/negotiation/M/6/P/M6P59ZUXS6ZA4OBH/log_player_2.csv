"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Looking at the options:

1. Alice's offer is $2,500,000, which exceeds the $1,200,000 that the product is worth to me.
2. If I reject Alice's offer, I can still consider other options.
3. John (not Jhon as mentioned in the options) is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is exactly my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's offer exceeds what the product is worth to me, and John's offer is at my maximum acceptable price, the logical choice is to buy from John.
