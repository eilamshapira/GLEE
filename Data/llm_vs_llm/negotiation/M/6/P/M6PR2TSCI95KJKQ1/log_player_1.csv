Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Considering my options: I need to make a decision.

I can either accept Bob's offer for $90, or reject it and risk a lower (or no) sale later. Selling to John guarantees $80. Since $90 is more than $80 and higher than my minimum value, I'll take the offer.
