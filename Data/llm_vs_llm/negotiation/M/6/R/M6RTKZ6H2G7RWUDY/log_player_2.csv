"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. If you're interested, I'd like to sell it to you for $15000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, considering its value to you, I was thinking of selling it for a bit higher. Would you be willing to pay $20000 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
