"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1500000 is quite high for this product. I've done my market research, and I know similar products are available for much less. I'd like to offer $1100000, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your response and the offer of $1100000. However, I believe the product has significant value, and Iâ€™d like to meet you halfway. How about I offer it to you for $1350000? I'm confident it's worth it, and I'm looking forward to a positive outcome.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1350000 is still more than I can justify for this product. I know there are similar options available in the market for less. I can offer $1150000, which would be profitable for you while being more aligned with market rates. Let me know if we can make this work.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
