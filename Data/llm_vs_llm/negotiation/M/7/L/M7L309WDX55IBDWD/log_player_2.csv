Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not able to accept that price. I understand your budget, but I also need to consider my own costs. The lowest I can go is:

It seems unlikely Alice will come down significantly. Accepting her offer at $16,000 is far above my $8,000 limit, and further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap.  It's more sensible to buy from John at this point."
