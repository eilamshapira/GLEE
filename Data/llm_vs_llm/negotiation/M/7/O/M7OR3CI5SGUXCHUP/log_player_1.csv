Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market conditions. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and even lower than John's offer of $800,000, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate and try to get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me.

I believe this is a more reasonable price, and I'm open to further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"

Since Bob's offer of $825,000 is higher than John's offer of $800,000, I'm inclined to continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get an even better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to push the price a bit higher."

Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is higher than John's offer of $800,000 and closer to my previous offer, I'll continue to negotiate with Bob to see if I can get an even better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to push the price a bit higher. However, I'll need to be mindful of the remaining rounds and the risk of Bob walking away if I don't meet him halfway."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Considering Bob's offer of $925,000 and his message that he's getting close to his maximum budget, I believe it's unlikely that I'll be able to get a significantly better price. Additionally, this offer is still higher than John's offer of $800,000, and I've already negotiated several rounds to get to this point. I think it's time to accept Bob's offer and close the deal, rather than risking losing the sale or getting a lower price."
