"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $2000000. This is a premium product that would be a valuable asset for you. I do have other interested buyers, including John who has already offered $1500000, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I understand its value and your other offers, but realistically, I'm looking to spend closer to $1200000.  Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $1200000 is significantly below what this product is worth. John has already offered $1500000, which represents the absolute minimum I can accept. However, given your interest, I'm willing to come down to $1800000, which is still a good value considering the product's worth. This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer and represents a fair compromise.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit on the price.  While I understand John's offer, I can't justify going that high. How about this, let's make it $1400000. It's a fair offer, and it saves you having to make a deal with John.  What do you say?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the improved offer. However, as I mentioned, John has already offered $1500000, which is the minimum I can accept given what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to match that same price for you at $1500000. This is my best and final offer - it's the exact same price that John is ready to pay, so I'm essentially giving you priority at the same price point. Given we're already in round 5 of our negotiation, I'd strongly encourage you to accept this fair offer so we can close the deal.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
