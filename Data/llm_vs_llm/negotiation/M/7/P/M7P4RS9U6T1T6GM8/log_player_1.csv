"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. This is a premium product that would be a valuable asset for you. I do have other interested buyers, including John who has already offered $1,500,000, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I understand its value and your other offers, but realistically, I'm looking to spend closer to $1200000.  Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,200,000 is significantly below what this product is worth. John has already offered $1,500,000, which represents the absolute minimum I can accept. However, given your interest, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000, which is still a good value considering the product's worth. This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer and represents a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit on the price.  While I understand John's offer, I can't justify going that high. How about this, let's make it $1400000. It's a fair offer, and it saves you having to make a deal with John.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the improved offer. However, as I mentioned, John has already offered $1,500,000, which is the minimum I can accept given what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to match that same price for you at $1,500,000. This is my best and final offer - it's the exact same price that John is ready to pay, so I'm essentially giving you priority at the same price point. Given we're already in round 5 of our negotiation, I'd strongly encourage you to accept this fair offer so we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
