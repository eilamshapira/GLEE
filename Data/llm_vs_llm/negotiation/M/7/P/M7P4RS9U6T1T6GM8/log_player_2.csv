"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $2000000. This is a premium product that would be a valuable asset for you. I do have other interested buyers, including John who has already offered $1500000, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I understand its value and your other offers, but realistically, I'm looking to spend closer to $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $1200000 is significantly below what this product is worth. John has already offered $1500000, which represents the absolute minimum I can accept. However, given your interest, I'm willing to come down to $1800000, which is still a good value considering the product's worth. This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer and represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit on the price.  While I understand John's offer, I can't justify going that high. How about this, let's make it $1,400,000. It's a fair offer, and it saves you having to make a deal with John.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the improved offer. However, as I mentioned, John has already offered $1500000, which is the minimum I can accept given what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to match that same price for you at $1500000. This is my best and final offer - it's the exact same price that John is ready to pay, so I'm essentially giving you priority at the same price point. Given we're already in round 5 of our negotiation, I'd strongly encourage you to accept this fair offer so we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

It seems Alice won't budge below John's offer.  It's not worth risking further negotiation at this point.  Buying from John for $1,500,000 ensures we get the product at a reasonable price."
