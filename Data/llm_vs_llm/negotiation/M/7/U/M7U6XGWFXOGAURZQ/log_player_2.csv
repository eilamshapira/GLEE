"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than my maximum budget of $1,500,000, and it's also less than what I would pay if I were to buy from John, it seems like a reasonable deal. Additionally, accepting this offer saves me $300,000 compared to buying from John.
