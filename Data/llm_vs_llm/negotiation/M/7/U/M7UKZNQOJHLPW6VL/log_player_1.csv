Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering its value to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle at $90. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.

While continued negotiation might eventually get Bob closer to a more acceptable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
