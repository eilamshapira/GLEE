"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Based on the information provided, both Alice and John are offering to sell the product for $150, which is exactly the maximum amount the product is worth to me.

Since both offers are identical at $150, there's no monetary advantage in choosing one over the other. Since Alice made the offer first and the outcome would be the same either way (paying $150), I might as well accept Alice's offer.
