Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price for Bob:

- The product is worth $100 to Bob
- I can guarantee $80 from John if Bob rejects
- Bob will accept if the price is less than or equal to $100
- I want to maximize my profit

I'll offer a price close to Bob's maximum value while giving him a small incentive to accept:

{""product_price"": 95}

This price gives Bob a $5 surplus while giving me $15 more than my fallback option with John."
