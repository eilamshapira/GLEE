,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to split the difference, and I appreciate that. However, I was thinking more along the lines of meeting in the middle between my last offer and your target price of $100, which I assume is still the maximum you're willing to pay. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial price. ",107.5,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet at $100, and I'm glad we're close. However, I was thinking that since you're getting a great product, I could use a tiny bit more to make this deal perfect for me. Would you be willing to go just a bit higher? ",102.5,Alice,7,
