Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target price. $80 is too low for me, and I think I can get a better deal."

Round 3

Round 4

$95 is still a bit lower than I'd like, and I think I can get closer to my target price. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I see you're trying to split the difference, and I appreciate that. However, I was thinking more along the lines of meeting in the middle between my last offer and your target price of $100, which I assume is still the maximum you're willing to pay. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial price. "", ""product_price"": 107.5}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're tough! I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle this right now at $100 even?  It's a win-win! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

$100 is very close to what I'm looking for, but I still have a few rounds left to try and get the best possible price. Since Bob is already at his maximum willingness to pay ($100), I'll try to squeeze out a bit more. If not, I can always sell to John for $120."
