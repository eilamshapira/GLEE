Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's not so high that it's likely to be rejected outright. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see where he stands on the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's well below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get more than $15,000 for the product, Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I consider fair.  I'm confident I can get a better price with another buyer, so I'll go ahead and sell to John."
