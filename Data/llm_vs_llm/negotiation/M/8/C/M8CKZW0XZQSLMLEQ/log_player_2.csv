"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's initial offer of $100 is below my maximum budget of $120, I'm inclined to try and negotiate a better price. The difference between Alice's offer and my maximum budget is $20, which suggests there might be room for negotiation.

Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of getting a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I don't know the value of the product to Alice, I'll aim for a price that is significantly lower than my maximum budget, while also being mindful that it needs to be a plausible offer for Alice to consider.

My counteroffer will be $80. This price is $20 lower than Alice's initial offer, which shows that I'm interested in the product but also looking for a better deal.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
