"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the offer from Alice is $1,000,000 and the product is only worth $1,000,000 to me, I should not accept it. Buying from Alice at this price leaves me with no profit. Also, buying from John would give me the same outcome. However, I can reject the offer from Alice to see if I can get a better deal in the next round.
So, the best course of action is to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer.

Therefore, the answer is {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 900000}"
