"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me at this price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I cannot accept $80 as it's below my cost. Given the product's quality and value, I can offer it to you for $150. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair offer.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price, but $150 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to offer $115 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",115.0,Bob,4,
