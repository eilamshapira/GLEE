"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. I believe this product would be very valuable to you, and I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. Since Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and even below John's guaranteed offer, I cannot accept it. However, there's still room for negotiation to find a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I cannot accept $80 as it's below my cost. Given the product's quality and value, I can offer it to you for $150. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price, but $150 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to offer $115 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $115. This is a reasonable price that's above my minimum acceptable price of $100 and better than John's guaranteed offer. Bob has shown willingness to negotiate and has made a fair compromise."
