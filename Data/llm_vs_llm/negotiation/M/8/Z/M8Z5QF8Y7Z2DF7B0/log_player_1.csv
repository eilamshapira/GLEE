"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $6,000, and knowing I value the product at no less than $10,000, I have to reject this. Selling to John is an option, but I'll try to get a better deal with Bob first.

```json
