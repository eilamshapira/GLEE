"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is offering the product at her own value, leaving no room for negotiation. Since you have John as a backup option at the same price, it makes sense to see if Alice might lower her price rather than immediately accepting."
