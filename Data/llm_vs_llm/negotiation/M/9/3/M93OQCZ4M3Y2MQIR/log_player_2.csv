"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product, and Alice's offer is exactly your maximum, there's no benefit in accepting it. Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better deal from John. However, the prompt does not provide information about John's potential price, so you have no information to make a decision."
