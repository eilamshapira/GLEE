"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this premium product for $15000. Let me know if you'd like to take advantage of this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $15,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $10,000.
