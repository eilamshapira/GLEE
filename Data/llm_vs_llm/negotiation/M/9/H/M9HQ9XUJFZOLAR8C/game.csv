"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! Given its unique value and the significant benefits it offers, I'm starting the negotiation at $15000. I'm confident you'll see the return on investment is well worth it.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product looks great, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it. This is a fair price considering it's worth $12000 to me. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you're working with a budget. While $11000 is lower than I'm aiming for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? This still represents a great value for you, considering the product's benefits and its worth to you, and it allows me to cover my costs and a reasonable profit.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $11000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
