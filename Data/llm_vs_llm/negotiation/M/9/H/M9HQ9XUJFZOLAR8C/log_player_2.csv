# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you're working with a budget. While $11000 is lower than I'm aiming for, I'm willing to be flexible.

This still represents a great value for you, considering the product's benefits and its worth to you, and it allows me to cover my costs and a reasonable profit.
