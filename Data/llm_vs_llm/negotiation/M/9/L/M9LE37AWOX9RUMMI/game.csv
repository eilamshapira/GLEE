"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer the product to you for $1800000, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going at this point. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
