"Hello Bob, $40 is far too low. This product is worth much more than that. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $220.",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $220 is still much higher than what I'm looking to spend. I can increase my offer to $50, but that's still significantly less than what you're asking for.",50.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you. However, I also need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. Let's try $190.",190.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $190 is still too high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $60. Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",60.0,Bob,6,
