Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is lower than my minimum price of $10,000 and also lower than what I know he's willing to pay ($12,000), I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be $11,500, which is closer to what I believe the product is worth to him but still leaves room for negotiation.

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and proceed with a counteroffer of $11,500.

Since we are only in Round 4 and I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, I'll reject his offer again and try to get closer to a price that I'm comfortable with.

My next counteroffer will be $11,000, which is slightly lower than my previous offer but still reflects the value I believe the product holds for Bob.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $9,250 is getting closer to my minimum price of $10,000, but it's still lower. Considering we are halfway through the negotiation rounds, I'll think about the potential outcomes.

Since Bob's offer is still below what I'm willing to accept, and I know he's willing to pay up to $12,000, I'll reject his offer again. However, I'll also consider that I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, which is becoming a more attractive option as the negotiation continues without reaching my desired price.

My next counteroffer will be $10,500, aiming to meet Bob halfway between his last offer and what I believe he's willing to pay.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $9,750 is closer to my minimum price of $10,000, but it's still slightly lower. Given that we're in Round 8 and I have only 2 more rounds to negotiate, I need to weigh my options carefully.

Accepting Bob's offer would mean selling the product for less than I ideally want, but it's very close to my minimum. Rejecting his offer and making another counteroffer risks him not increasing his bid enough or at all, which could lead to me having to sell to John for $10,000 anyway.

Considering these factors, I'm inclined to reject Bob's offer one more time, hoping he'll meet me at or above $10,000 in the next round. My next counteroffer will be $10,250, which is a slight reduction from my previous offer, indicating my willingness to compromise but still aiming to get as close as possible to what I believe the product is worth to him.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","We've reached the final round. Bob's offer of $10,125 is higher than my minimum price of $10,000 and very close to what I was hoping to achieve. Given that this is the last round and I won't have another chance to negotiate, I need to make a decision based on the options available.

Rejecting Bob's offer would mean I'd have to sell to John for $10,000, which is less than Bob's current offer. Accepting Bob's offer of $10,125 would give me a slightly better deal than selling to John.

Considering these factors, I decide to accept Bob's offer of $10,125, as it's the best option available to me at this point.
