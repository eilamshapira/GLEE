Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my offer to Bob carefully:

1. Bob values the product at $150
2. I value the product at $100 (my minimum acceptable price)
3. If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for exactly $100
4. Bob will accept any price up to $150

My best strategy is to offer a price that's less than Bob's maximum value but significantly more than my fallback option with John. I want to ensure Bob accepts while maximizing my profit.
