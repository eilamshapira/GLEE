"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll analyze this situation:

- Alice's offer: $1,400,000
- The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice
- My maximum valuation: $1,500,000
- John's fixed price: $1,500,000
- I have 10 rounds to negotiate

Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000 gives me some room to negotiate down, as it's $100,000 less than John's price. Since we have multiple rounds available and this is just the first offer, I should try to negotiate a better price with Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives me a good price while still being above Alice's cost:

{""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I see Alice has come down from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000, which is progress. However, we still have several rounds left to negotiate, and there's likely more room to negotiate given that the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice. Her current offer would give her a $150,000 profit, while I can still save $150,000 compared to John's price.

I should continue negotiating to try to reach a better price.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her price again from $1,350,000 to $1,320,000, showing that she's willing to continue negotiating. We're making progress, as each offer brings the price lower. We still have several rounds left, and there's a $120,000 gap between her offer and her cost ($1,200,000).

I'll continue negotiating to try to reach a better price.
