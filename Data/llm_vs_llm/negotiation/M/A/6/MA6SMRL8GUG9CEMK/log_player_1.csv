Send your offer to Bob.,"I understand the situation. As Alice, I need to sell my product which is worth at least $1,500,000 to me. I know Bob values it at $1,500,000, and I have John as a backup buyer at exactly $1,500,000.

Since the product is worth exactly $1,500,000 to Bob, I'll start with a price slightly above that, leaving some room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.
