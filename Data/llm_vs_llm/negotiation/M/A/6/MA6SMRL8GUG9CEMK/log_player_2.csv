"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to me and Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is higher than that, it doesn't make sense to accept the offer. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,500,000, which is within my budget. However, I'd like to try to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to me, I'll offer a price that is slightly lower than that.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,550,000 is still higher than the product's worth to me, which is $1,500,000. However, it's closer to my target price than her initial offer. I'm not willing to pay more than the product's worth to me, so I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate further.

Before making another counteroffer, I'll consider the option to buy from John for $1,500,000, which is still available. But I'll try to negotiate with Alice a bit more to see if we can reach a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $1,550,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between her offer and the product's worth to me, which is $1,500,000. I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one, but still lower than Alice's last offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,525,000 is getting closer to the product's worth to me, which is $1,500,000. However, I'm still not willing to pay more than the product's worth to me. Since I have the option to buy from John for $1,500,000, which is a better price, I think it's time to stop negotiating with Alice.
