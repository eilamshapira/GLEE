"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my research and budget, I'd be comfortable paying $80 for it. This would be a fair price that works for me. Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer Bob. While I appreciate your interest, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but I have another seller offering the same product for $100. I'd like to buy from you if possible, so I can offer $90, which saves me some money while still giving you a sale. Would that work for you?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have another offer. Since you prefer to buy from me, how about we meet at $105? It's just a bit more than the other offer, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",105.0,Alice,5,

"Thanks for working with me, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still can't justify paying more than what John is offering. Since I'd prefer to buy from you, I can offer $95, which is very close to the other offer. This is the highest I can go while still making financial sense for me. Can we make a deal at this price?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm going to be straight with you. I'd prefer to sell the product to you. If I accept your offer of $95, I would be losing money on the deal. Considering your preference to buy from me, I'll split the difference between your offer of $95 and the minimum I'd accept. How about $100? This gives us both what we want, and is just a little bit more than the other offer.",100.0,Alice,7,
