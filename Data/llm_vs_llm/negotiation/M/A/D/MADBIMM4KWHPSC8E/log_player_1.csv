"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm offering it to you for $150."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my research and budget, I'd be comfortable paying $80 for it. This would be a fair price that works for me. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Given Bob's counteroffer of $80, which is below my minimum acceptable price of $100, I will reject it and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer Bob. While I appreciate your interest, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $115?"", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but I have another seller offering the same product for $100. I'd like to buy from you if possible, so I can offer $90, which saves me some money while still giving you a sale. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is still below my minimum of $100. Given that he has another offer for $100, I need to consider my options carefully. I could potentially get a better price with Bob, but I also risk losing him to the other seller. 

Considering that I have other buyers available, I will reject Bob's offer and will make a counter offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob, trying to close the deal:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have another offer. Since you prefer to buy from me, how about we meet at $105? It's just a bit more than the other offer, and I think you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for working with me, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still can't justify paying more than what John is offering. Since I'd prefer to buy from you, I can offer $95, which is very close to the other offer. This is the highest I can go while still making financial sense for me. Can we make a deal at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer of $95 is still below my ideal price, but at this point, I have to consider the risk of losing the sale entirely. He's clearly getting close to his limit, and the other offer is $100. 

I could try to push for a slightly higher price, but I risk losing him. Since I'm at risk of going over the rounds and Bob's offer is the closest I have got, I will reject his offer one last time and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, this is the critical round. Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm going to be straight with you. I'd prefer to sell the product to you. If I accept your offer of $95, I would be losing money on the deal. Considering your preference to buy from me, I'll split the difference between your offer of $95 and the minimum I'd accept. How about $100? This gives us both what we want, and is just a little bit more than the other offer."", ""product_price"": 100}"
