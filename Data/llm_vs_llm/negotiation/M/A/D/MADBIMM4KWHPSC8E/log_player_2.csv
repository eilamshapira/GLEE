"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm offering it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Based on the information provided, Alice's initial offer is $150, which is more than what I'm willing to pay given that the product is worth no more than $100 to me. Additionally, I already have an option to buy the same product from John for $100.

Since Alice's offer exceeds the maximum value I place on the product and is higher than my alternative option, I should reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my research and budget, I'd be comfortable paying $80 for it. This would be a fair price that works for me. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer Bob. While I appreciate your interest, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $115 is still higher than the alternative option to buy from John for $100. Since I can get the exact same product from John for less money, I should reject Alice's current offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but I have another seller offering the same product for $100. I'd like to buy from you if possible, so I can offer $90, which saves me some money while still giving you a sale. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have another offer. Since you prefer to buy from me, how about we meet at $105? It's just a bit more than the other offer, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's offer of $105 is still higher than John's price of $100. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible while buying the product, and there's no indication that Alice's product is any different or better than John's, I should reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for working with me, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still can't justify paying more than what John is offering. Since I'd prefer to buy from you, I can offer $95, which is very close to the other offer. This is the highest I can go while still making financial sense for me. Can we make a deal at this price?"", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm going to be straight with you. I'd prefer to sell the product to you. If I accept your offer of $95, I would be losing money on the deal. Considering your preference to buy from me, I'll split the difference between your offer of $95 and the minimum I'd accept. How about $100? This gives us both what we want, and is just a little bit more than the other offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Now Alice's offer is $100, which is exactly the same as John's price. Since there's no price advantage to buying from either seller at this point, and Alice has been negotiating with me in good faith, I might as well accept her offer.
