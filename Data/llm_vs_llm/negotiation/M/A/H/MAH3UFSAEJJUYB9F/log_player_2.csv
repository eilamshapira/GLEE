"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","In this situation, Alice's offer is $150, which is equal to John's price of $150. Since both prices are the same and equal to my maximum value for the product, I am indifferent between accepting Alice's offer or buying from John.

Given that the prices are identical, I might as well accept Alice's offer since she made the effort to present it.
