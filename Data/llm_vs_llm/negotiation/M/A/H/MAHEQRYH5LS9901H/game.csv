"Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product sounds interesting, that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $800000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer of $800000, but I'm afraid I cannot accept it as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I have another buyer willing to pay $1000000 for this product. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Given the product's quality and value, I can offer it to you for $1400000, which is significantly lower than my initial offer. I hope we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price, but $1400000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000.  However, I need to be realistic - if we can't agree on a price closer to this number, I may need to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be transparent that I have a standing offer of $1000000 from another buyer. While I'd prefer to work with you, I cannot accept less than what I'm already guaranteed elsewhere. My best offer is $1150000, which still represents a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a premium product with substantial value, and I believe this price reflects a fair compromise. I hope we can reach an agreement, but I'll need to move forward with my other buyer if we cannot find common ground near this price point.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
