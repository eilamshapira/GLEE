Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product sounds interesting, that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $800000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll now send a counteroffer to Bob since his offer is below what I can get from John and below my valuation of the product."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer of $800,000, but I'm afraid I cannot accept it as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I have another buyer willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Given the product's quality and value, I can offer it to you for $1,400,000, which is significantly lower than my initial offer. I hope we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price, but $1400000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000.  However, I need to be realistic - if we can't agree on a price closer to this number, I may need to explore other options.

I'll continue negotiating with Bob but will make a counteroffer closer to John's guaranteed offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be transparent that I have a standing offer of $1,000,000 from another buyer. While I'd prefer to work with you, I cannot accept less than what I'm already guaranteed elsewhere. My best offer is $1,150,000, which still represents a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a premium product with substantial value, and I believe this price reflects a fair compromise. I hope we can reach an agreement, but I'll need to move forward with my other buyer if we cannot find common ground near this price point."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
