Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer of $800000, but I'm afraid I cannot accept it as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I have another buyer willing to pay $1000000 for this product. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Given the product's quality and value, I can offer it to you for $1400000, which is significantly lower than my initial offer. I hope we can find common ground.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be transparent that I have a standing offer of $1000000 from another buyer. While I'd prefer to work with you, I cannot accept less than what I'm already guaranteed elsewhere. My best offer is $1150000, which still represents a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a premium product with substantial value, and I believe this price reflects a fair compromise. I hope we can reach an agreement, but I'll need to move forward with my other buyer if we cannot find common ground near this price point.

Reasoning: 

Alice is firm on her price and has signaled she has another buyer at $1,000,000. It's unlikely we'll get a better deal from her at this point. John's offer is $150,000 cheaper, making it the most financially sound decision."
