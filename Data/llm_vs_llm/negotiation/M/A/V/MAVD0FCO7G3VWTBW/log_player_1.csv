"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 3500000}

I am negotiating with Bob and will continue to do so to get the best price for the product. I have not yet decided to sell to John, so I am still in negotiations with Bob. This is a strategic move to see if Bob will increase his offer, which will bring more profit than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
{""product_price"": 2500000}

Bob is increasing his offers, but they are still below the price that John is willing to pay. I will continue negotiating with Bob to see if he can match or exceed John's offer, while gradually lowering my asking price to see where Bob's limit lies. This strategy allows me to maximize my potential profit without selling to John prematurely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000}

I have lowered my asking price to see if Bob will increase his offer. If Bob accepts this offer, I will make a profit that is double what John is willing to pay. If Bob rejects this offer, I will use the remaining rounds to negotiate further or choose to sell to John if Bob's counteroffers are not competitive. This is a reasonable step to take in this negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 6
{""product_price"": 1500000}

Bob has matched John's offer, but I believe there is still room for negotiation. By lowering my asking price, I can see if Bob is willing to pay more than John. If Bob rejects this offer, I can always choose to sell to John in the next round. This strategy allows me to potentially make more money than John's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000}

I have lowered my asking price again to see if Bob will meet me in the middle. If Bob accepts this offer, I will make a profit that is $200,000 more than John's offer. If Bob rejects this offer, I will have to consider selling to John or accepting a lower offer from Bob, depending on Bob's next move. This is a strategic decision based on the remaining negotiation rounds."
