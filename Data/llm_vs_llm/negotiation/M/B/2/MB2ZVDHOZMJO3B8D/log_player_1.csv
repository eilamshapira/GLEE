Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're attributing to the product, my budget is quite constrained. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering alternatives available to me. Let me know if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer matches the minimum price I'm willing to accept, but I believe the product is worth more, I'll try to negotiate further to see if Bob is willing to increase his offer. 

Here's my counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that budget constraints are a consideration, but I truly believe this product has more value to offer. Considering this, I'm willing to make a concession from my initial price. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.
