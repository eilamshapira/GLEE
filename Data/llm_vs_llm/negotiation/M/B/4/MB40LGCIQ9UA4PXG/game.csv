"Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Based on market research and the product's features, I'm offering it to you for $18500. This is a competitive price for the value you'll receive. I look forward to your response.",18500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the information you provided, $18500 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $10000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my current budget constraints. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand budget constraints, but I'm afraid $10000 is below what I can accept for this product. The quality and features justify a higher price point. I can come down to $16000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  $16000 is still a little high for me. I can increase my offer to $12000. This is a considerable jump from my previous offer and reflects my serious interest in acquiring the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",12000.0,Bob,4,
