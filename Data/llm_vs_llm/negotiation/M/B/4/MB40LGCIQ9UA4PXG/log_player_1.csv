Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the information you provided, $18500 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $10000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my current budget constraints. Let me know what you think.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand budget constraints, but I'm afraid $10,000 is below what I can accept for this product. The quality and features justify a higher price point. I can come down to $16,000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}"

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  $16000 is still a little high for me. I can increase my offer to $12000. This is a considerable jump from my previous offer and reflects my serious interest in acquiring the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.
