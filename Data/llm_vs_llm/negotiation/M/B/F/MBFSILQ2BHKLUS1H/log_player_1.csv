"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, I'm ready. Considering the product's value and the limited rounds, I'll start with a high but hopefully reasonable offer.

{""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","This is a tough spot. Bob's offer is at my minimum value. I have to consider the risk of further negotiation.

I'll consider my options:

*   **Accept Bob's offer:** Guaranteeing $800,000 is safe, but I might be leaving money on the table.
*   **Reject Bob's offer and counter:** Riskier, but I could get more. I have 8 rounds left.
*   **Sell to John:** I can get $800,000 immediately.

Given that this is only round 2, I think I will take the risk of another round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, I'll try to push the price up a little, but I'll need to make a reasonable counteroffer, since I need to close the deal to make a profit.

{""product_price"": 875000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $840,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $840,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Okay, Bob is inching up. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm still above my minimum.

Here's my thought process:

*   **Accept:** Secure $840,000. It's a good profit, and I avoid the risk of the deal falling through.
*   **Reject and counter:** I could get more, but risk losing the deal.
*   **Sell to John:** Get a sure $800,000.

I'll take the risk of one more round.
