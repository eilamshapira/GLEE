"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $14000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your prompt response and for sharing your thoughts on the price. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13500, considering the product's value and its potential to benefit you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your proposal. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in discussing further.",13500.0,Alice,3,
