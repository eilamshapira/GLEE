# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will bring you significant value. After careful consideration, I'm willing to let it go for a price of $14000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
