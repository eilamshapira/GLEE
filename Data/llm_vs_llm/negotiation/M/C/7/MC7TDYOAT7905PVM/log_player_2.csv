"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you. While I've received an offer of $150 from another buyer, I wanted to give you the opportunity to purchase it first since we've done business before. Given the current market value and the existing offer I have, I'm selling this product for $150. Would you like to purchase it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
