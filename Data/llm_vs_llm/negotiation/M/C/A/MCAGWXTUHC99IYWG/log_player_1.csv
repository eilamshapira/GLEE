Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. I want to maximize my profit, and I know I have a guaranteed $120 from John if Bob rejects my offer. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, but it could potentially be higher, I should offer a price significantly above $120 to try to capture more value, while still keeping it reasonable enough that Bob might accept.
