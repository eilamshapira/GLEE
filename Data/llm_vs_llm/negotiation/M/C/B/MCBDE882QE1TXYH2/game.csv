"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you this incredible product. I know you've had your eye on it, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1450000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I agree this product would be valuable, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and the immense value it would bring you.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1300000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1100000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground.  However, the product's value to you is significant, even at $1200000. I'm willing to accept that price, but I can't go any lower. This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
