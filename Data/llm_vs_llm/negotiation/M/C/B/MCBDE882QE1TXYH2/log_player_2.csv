# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you this incredible product. I know you've had your eye on it, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to you.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and the immense value it would bring you.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground.  However, the product's value to you is significant, even at $1200000. I'm willing to accept that price, but I can't go any lower. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Reason: While the product is worth more to Alice, she's holding firm at her valuation. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap, and I have a guaranteed option with John at my maximum budget."
