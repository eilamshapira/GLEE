Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm glad you're interested in purchasing this valuable product. Given its rarity and high demand, I'm offering it to you for a price that reflects its true worth."", ""product_price"": 1,200,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1200000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, as his offer of $800,000 is lower than what I am willing to accept, and I believe I can negotiate a better price. Selling to John is an option, but I want to try to get a better deal with Bob first."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a price that's closer to the product's true value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly. However, my budget is limited. I can increase my offer to $850000. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make another counteroffer to Bob in the next round, as his offer of $850,000 is still lower than what I am willing to accept. I believe I can negotiate a better price, and I'm not ready to settle for an offer that's $150,000 below the product's value to me. Selling to John is still an option, but I want to try to get a better deal with Bob first."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer.
