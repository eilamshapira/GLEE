"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's quite a bit higher than I was expecting. I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to pay $400000 for the product. How about we discuss this further?",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $400000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. The value and potential of this product are significantly higher. How about we meet in the middle? I can come down to $2750000.",2750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2750000 is still way above what I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to raise my offer to $500000. Let's keep discussing and find some middle ground.",500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but we're still quite far apart. To be frank, at $500000, I'd rather sell the product to someone else. However, I'm willing to continue negotiating with you, since I believe you recognize the value in this product. My new offer is $2500000.",2500000.0,Alice,5,
