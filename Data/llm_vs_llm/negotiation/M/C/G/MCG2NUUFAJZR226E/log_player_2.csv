Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's quite a bit higher than I was expecting. I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to pay $400,000 for the product. How about we discuss this further?"

Alice, I'm afraid we're just too far apart on this. I can't justify spending that much on this product. I've decided to purchase from another seller. Thank you for your time."
