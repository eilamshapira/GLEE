"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $11,000 is quite reasonable - it's significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) and represents a good profit. While I could try to negotiate for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that prolonged negotiation might lead to a less favorable outcome or Bob walking away. The current offer provides a $1,000 premium over John's guaranteed offer.
