"Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer of $145 is close to John's price of $150, and I know the product is worth $120 to Alice, I should reject and try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $120 to Alice, I'll start with a relatively low offer but not too low to be unreasonable. I'll offer slightly above her cost to make it potentially attractive while leaving room for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has lowered her price from $145 to $140, showing willingness to negotiate. However, since she rejected my $125 offer but did come down in price, there's likely still room for negotiation. The $140 is still closer to John's price ($150) than I'd like, so I'll reject and try one more counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still try to get a good deal. Since Alice came down $5 from her initial offer, I'll go up by a similar amount from my initial offer to show good faith in negotiating.

{""product_price"": 130}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has now offered $135, which is a good price considering:
1. It's $15 less than John's price of $150
2. Alice has gradually lowered her price from $145 → $140 → $135
3. It's a fair middle ground between my last offer ($130) and her previous offer ($140)
4. We might risk losing progress if we continue negotiating
