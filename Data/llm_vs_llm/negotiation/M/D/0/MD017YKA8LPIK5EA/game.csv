"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $110. This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive from it.",110.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I believe the product is valuable, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'd be willing to pay that price for it.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $90, I need to consider my costs and the value this product provides. I can come down to $105, which is still a great deal considering the product's quality and utility. This represents a meaningful discount from my initial offer.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $105. However, I'm still a bit constrained by my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $95, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my needs. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your effort to reach a middle ground. I can see you're genuinely interested in the product. Let me meet you partway - I can offer it at $100. This is really the best I can do while still covering my costs and providing you with excellent value. At this price point, it's still a good investment considering what you'll get from it.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for coming down to $100. I'm getting closer to my target budget, but I still need to squeeze out a bit more value. Considering your costs and the product's worth, I'd like to propose $97.50. This is a very minor adjustment, and I believe it's a reasonable ask given our back-and-forth negotiations.",97.5,Bob,6,
