"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since the offered price of $2,000,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,200,000, it would be illogical to accept this offer. Additionally, buying from John for $1,200,000 is an option but negotiating with Alice might yield a better price. Therefore, the best course of action is to reject Alice's offer and proceed with making a counteroffer in hopes of getting a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that my maximum budget is $1,200,000 and Alice's initial offer was $2,000,000, a reasonable starting point for negotiations would be to offer a price that is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still within my budget. Offering a price too close to my maximum budget might not leave room for further negotiation. Therefore, I'll start by offering a price that is halfway between $0 and my maximum budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,500,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. Since buying from John for $1,200,000 is an option that fits within my budget, and Alice's offer does not, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer again. However, before giving up on the negotiation with Alice, I'd like to try and see if we can get closer to my budget or at least understand if there's any flexibility in Alice's pricing.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice's latest offer was $1,500,000 and my previous counteroffer was $600,000, and considering that my maximum budget is $1,200,000, I should make a counteroffer that is closer to my budget but still leaves some room for negotiation. Offering a price too close to my maximum might not be strategic, as it leaves little room for further negotiation. Therefore, I'll increase my offer from $600,000 to a midpoint between $600,000 and $1,200,000, which is $900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,200,000 exactly matches my maximum budget and is the same price that John is offering. At this point, since Alice has met my budget limit and there's no financial advantage to continuing negotiations or buying from John (as the prices are the same), the decision becomes one of convenience, trust, or any other non-price factors that might influence the purchase decision.

However, since the task is focused solely on the financial aspect and saving as much money as possible, and given that Alice's offer now matches the maximum I'm willing to pay, it's reasonable to accept this offer as it meets my budget constraint exactly.
