"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $12000. If you're interested in making the purchase now, please let me know. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","After analyzing the offers and my constraints, I can see that:

1. Alice is offering the product for $12,000
2. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
3. John is offering the same product for $8,000

Since Alice's price of $12,000 exceeds the maximum value of $8,000 that the product is worth to me, and John is offering the same product at exactly $8,000, the rational choice is to buy from John.
