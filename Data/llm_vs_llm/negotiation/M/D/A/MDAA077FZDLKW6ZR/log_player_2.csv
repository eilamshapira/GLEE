"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is above my maximum budget of $800,000, it doesn't make sense to accept it. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $800,000, which is within my budget. However, I want to try to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. I'll offer $600,000, which is below my maximum budget of $800,000. This gives us room for negotiation and allows Alice to consider my offer.
