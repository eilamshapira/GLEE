"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point considering the potential value of the product to Bob. I'll be prepared to negotiate, but I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and what his initial reaction will be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value, and while I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to accept a price that undervalues my product. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is still a good profit for me and closer to his offer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still protecting my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not ready to sell for that price. I believe we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,250,000.  This is a small compromise, but it demonstrates my commitment to negotiating and getting a deal done. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm seriously considering selling to John."
