"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering my product for sale at $8000. It’s a quality item and priced fairly based on its value. Please let me know if you’d like to move forward with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's initial offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($8,000), and I know I can get the same product from John for the same price, I don't see a need to accept the offer immediately without trying to negotiate a better price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in hopes of getting a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable, to see if we can negotiate a better price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"
