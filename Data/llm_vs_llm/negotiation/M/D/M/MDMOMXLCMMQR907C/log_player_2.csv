"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a great deal!  Alice's offer of $12,000 is well below your $15,000 maximum and there's no guarantee you'll get a better price through further negotiation."
