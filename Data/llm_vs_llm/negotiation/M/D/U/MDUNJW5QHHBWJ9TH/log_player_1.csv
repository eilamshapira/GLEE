Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make an offer to Bob for the product. I should try to maximize my earnings, but I also need to be mindful that if Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell to John for $150.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll offer a price that's reasonably above my minimum acceptable value, but not so high that Bob would certainly reject it.
