"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. After careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $95. This price represents good value considering the product's quality and utility.",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Alice. While the product does look interesting, $95 seems a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $60 is significantly below what I can accept for this item. The product is worth at least $80 to me, and I know its value to you is higher. I can come down to $90, which I believe is a fair price that gives you good value while allowing me a reasonable return.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice.  I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is pushing my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your attempt to meet in the middle. However, I have a firm minimum of $80 for this product based on its value. I know you'll get excellent utility from it at $85, which is still a good deal compared to its $100 value to you. This represents a fair compromise where we both benefit from the transaction.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm willing to go up to $80, but that's my absolute limit.  This would be a fair price considering your stated minimum.",80.0,Bob,6,
