"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer is $15,000, which is the same price as John's offer, there's no advantage in accepting Alice's offer over buying from John. However, by rejecting Alice's offer, I can make a counteroffer that might get me a better price. Therefore, I should reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low but reasonable counteroffer. Since the product is worth up to $15,000 to me, and I want to save money, I'll start with an offer significantly below that to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 10000}

This offer is substantially lower than both Alice's offer and John's price, giving room for negotiation while still being a serious offer. If Alice rejects this, we can still work our way up to a mutually agreeable price, and I always have the option to go to John if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has significantly lowered her price from $15,000 to $12,000, which is a $3,000 savings compared to John's price. This is a substantial improvement and represents a good deal since it's well below my maximum value of $15,000. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might increase her price in future rounds, and I'd lose this good offer. The $12,000 price represents a significant savings, so I should take it.
