"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob and I can always sell it to John for $12,000, I'll start with a high offer to test Bob's willingness to negotiate.

{""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $9,000 since it's below both my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and even below Bob's own valuation ($10,000). Since I can sell to John for $12,000 at any time, there's no reason to accept less than that.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price slightly from my initial offer, but still keep it well above my minimum threshold of $12,000 to leave room for negotiation while signaling that I have a high reservation price.

{""product_price"": 12800}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $9,500 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Since I can sell to John for $12,000, and Bob's offers are still far below that, it's time to end the negotiation and take John's guaranteed offer.
