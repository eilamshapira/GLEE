"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's $13,500, but not so low as to be insulting. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice and no more than $10,000 to me, I'll start with a low offer to leave room for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer of $12,800 is still significantly higher than John's price of $10,000, and higher than my maximum value of $10,000, there's no reason to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has come down from $13,500 to $12,800, I'll increase my previous offer somewhat to show willingness to negotiate, but still keep it below my maximum value of $10,000.
