"Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $60 is much too low for this product's value. While I can be flexible on the price, I cannot go below $150 as this product has exceptional quality and features. Would you consider this more reasonable offer?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $150 is still significantly higher than what I had in mind.  Perhaps we can find a compromise. Would you consider $80 for the product?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your attempt to find a middle ground, but I need to be transparent - I cannot go below $135 for this product. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects the true value of what you're getting. Would you be able to meet me at this price?",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still beyond my budget.  To be completely honest, $80 is the absolute highest I can go. I understand if that doesn't work for you, and I'll have to consider other options.",80.0,Bob,6,
