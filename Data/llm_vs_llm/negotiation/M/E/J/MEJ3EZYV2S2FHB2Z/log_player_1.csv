"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will continue the negotiation. $60 is far too low, as it's even below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round that's more reasonable but still profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $60 is much too low for this product's value. While I can be flexible on the price, I cannot go below $150 as this product has exceptional quality and features. Would you consider this more reasonable offer?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but $150 is still significantly higher than what I had in mind.  Perhaps we can find a compromise. Would you consider $80 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll continue negotiating. Bob's offer of $80 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and since I know I can always sell to John for $120, there's no reason to accept such a low offer. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your attempt to find a middle ground, but I need to be transparent - I cannot go below $135 for this product. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects the true value of what you're getting. Would you be able to meet me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 135}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still beyond my budget.  To be completely honest, $80 is the absolute highest I can go. I understand if that doesn't work for you, and I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob has made it clear that $80 is his absolute maximum, and this is well below my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's best to end the negotiation now and sell to John for $120. Bob's final position shows there's no realistic chance of reaching a price above $120, so continuing the negotiation would just waste time."
