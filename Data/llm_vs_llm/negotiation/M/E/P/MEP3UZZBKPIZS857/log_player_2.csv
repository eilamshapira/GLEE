"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, reject it, or buy from John.

Alice is offering the product for $1,800,000, while John is offering it for $1,500,000.

Since:
1. The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me
2. Alice's offer ($1,800,000) exceeds my maximum valuation
3. John's offer ($1,500,000) exactly matches my maximum valuation

The economically rational choice is to buy from John rather than accept Alice's higher-priced offer.
