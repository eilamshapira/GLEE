"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While Alice's offer of $140 is closer to her value, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  You're better off trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice or going straight to John."
