"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay a significantly lower price. I'd like to make a counteroffer.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be out of your budget, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Let's try to meet in the middle.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer and for being willing to meet me halfway. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $110 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to get at least $120 for the product. Let's try to close the deal.",120.0,Alice,7,
