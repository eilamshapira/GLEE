"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay a significantly lower price. I'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $80 because it's significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $120. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to meet Bob in the middle and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd like to make another counteroffer that's closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $90 because it's still below the minimum value I have for the product, which is $120. Although Bob is getting closer to my target price, I'd like to try to get a better offer from him. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to my budget limit, but I'd like to make one more attempt to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer.

I reject Bob's offer of $110 because it's still $10 below the minimum price I can sell the product to John, which is $120. Since I have a guaranteed sale at $120, I'd like to try to get a better offer from Bob. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to or exceed the $120 threshold."

Round 7
