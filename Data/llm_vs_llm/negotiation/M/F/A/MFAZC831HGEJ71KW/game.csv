"Thanks for considering my counteroffer, Alice. Based on my budget and the product's market value, I think $800000 is a fair price. I understand that you value the product greatly, but I believe this offer is more aligned with what I'm looking for.,",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you have a budget in mind, but I still believe the product is worth more than $800000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I'm making a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my initial price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that we both have different perspectives on the product's value, but I believe that $900000 is a fair and reasonable offer. I'm looking for a good deal, and I think this price point reflects that. I hope we can find a compromise that works for both of us,",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid to $900000. However, I'm still looking for a price that's closer to the product's true value. Considering your initial interest and the product's worth to you, I'm making a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one, but still reflects the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I want to close the deal, Alice. I believe $950000 is a realistic price and it is still a profitable deal for you. This is my final offer.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not convinced that $950000 is the best price for this product. Since you've stated that this is your final offer, I'm going to make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one, but still higher than your final offer. If you're not willing to budge, I do have another buyer interested in the product at a price of $1000000, and I need to consider their offer as well.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
