Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for considering my counteroffer, Alice. Based on my budget and the product's market value, I think $800000 is a fair price. I understand that you value the product greatly, but I believe this offer is more aligned with what I'm looking for., 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $800,000 because it's significantly lower than the product's value to me and to Bob himself, which is $1,200,000. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to proceed to the next round to try and reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is an option, but I'd like to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob first."

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we both have different perspectives on the product's value, but I believe that $900000 is a fair and reasonable offer. I'm looking for a good deal, and I think this price point reflects that. I hope we can find a compromise that works for both of us, 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $900,000. Although it's higher than his previous offer, it's still lower than the product's value to me, and I believe I can get a better price. Since Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is still an option, but I'd like to try and get a higher price from Bob first. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid to $900,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $950,000. Although it's his final offer and closer to my target, I still believe I can get a better price. Since Bob has stated that this is his final offer, I don't expect him to increase his bid further. Given that I have the option to sell the product to John for $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's final offer, I'm inclined to explore this alternative. However, I'll make one last attempt to negotiate with Bob before making a final decision. I'll proceed to the next round, but if Bob doesn't revise his offer, I'll likely sell to John."

However, I'm still not convinced that $950,000 is the best price for this product. Since you've stated that this is your final offer, I'm going to make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one, but still higher than your final offer. If you're not willing to budge, I do have another buyer interested in the product at a price of $1,000,000, and I need to consider their offer as well."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
