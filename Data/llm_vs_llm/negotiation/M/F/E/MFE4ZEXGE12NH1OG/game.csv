"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is too high for me. I've seen similar products selling for much less. I can offer you $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is too low for me. The product is worth much more. Let's split the difference. How about $85? This is a fair price, considering the quality of the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. However, I know I can get this product elsewhere for $80. I can offer you $75 - this would still give you a sale today, and I'd rather buy from you if we can agree on a fair price.",75.0,Bob,4,
