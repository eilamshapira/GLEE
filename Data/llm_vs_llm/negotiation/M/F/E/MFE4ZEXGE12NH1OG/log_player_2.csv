"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale! I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a real bargain, considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering the product for $100
2. The product is worth no more than $80 to me
3. I know I can buy it from John for $80
4. Alice's initial offer is clearly too high
5. It makes sense to reject and make a counteroffer to see if I can get it for less than $80

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer significantly lower than both Alice's price and John's price to leave room for negotiation:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is too high for me. I've seen similar products selling for much less. I can offer you $60 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is too low for me. The product is worth much more. Let's split the difference. How about $85? This is a fair price, considering the quality of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice has come down from $100 to $85
2. However, $85 is still above John's price of $80
3. Since I can definitely get it for $80 from John, there's no reason to accept $85
4. I should either try one more counteroffer to see if I can get it even cheaper from Alice, or just go with John's offer
5. Since we still have several rounds left, I'll try one more counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly below John's price, showing I have alternatives but still giving Alice a chance to make the sale:

{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. However, I know I can get this product elsewhere for $80. I can offer you $75 - this would still give you a sale today, and I'd rather buy from you if we can agree on a fair price."", ""product_price"": 75}"
