"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $14,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John at $15,000

Since:
- The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
- Alice's offer ($14,000) is less than John's price ($15,000)
- Alice's offer would save me $1,000 compared to buying from John

The logical choice is to accept Alice's offer, as it provides the best value while being below my maximum price threshold.
