"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested in buying it, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a lower price.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, I need to get at least $100 for this item as that's my bottom line. However, I can come down from my initial offer to $120, which I believe is fair considering the value of the product. Would this work for you?",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that $100 is your bottom line, but I'm still not comfortable paying $120. I'd like to meet you in the middle and propose a price of $110. This way, we can both get a fair deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
