"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $500000, considering the product's value to me.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $500000 is significantly below the product's true value, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1750000. This reflects a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Please let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and lower the price to $1750000. However, this is still above my desired budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to propose a price of $1125000. This reflects a serious commitment to purchasing the product, and I believe it's a fair price considering the negotiations so far.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to find a price that works for both of us. While $1125000 is closer to my desired price point, it's still too far below the product's real value. I'm willing to compromise further and offer a final price of $1400000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my genuine desire to close this deal with you. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
