"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product and willing to make a serious offer. I'd like to propose a price of $8000, which I believe is reasonable considering my needs and budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and offer.  While I appreciate your perspective, $8000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $10000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",10000.0,Alice,3,
