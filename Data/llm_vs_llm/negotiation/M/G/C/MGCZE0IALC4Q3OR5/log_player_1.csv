Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to choose a price that maximizes my expected return. The product is worth at least $100 to me, and I have a guaranteed fallback of $100 from John if Bob rejects my offer.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I need to balance between setting a high price (to maximize my profit if Bob accepts) and the risk of Bob rejecting my offer (in which case I get $100 from John).

A reasonable approach is to set a price significantly higher than my $100 floor, but not so high that Bob would likely reject it.
