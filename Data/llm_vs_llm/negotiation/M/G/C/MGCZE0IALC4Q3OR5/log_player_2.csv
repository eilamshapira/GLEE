"Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer ($175) is significantly higher than John's price ($100) and exceeds my maximum value for the product ($100), the rational decision would be to buy from John.
