"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell this product to me. However, I believe your asking price of $14500 is quite high considering the market value. I'm prepared to offer $12500 for the product, which I think is fair and would still provide you with a reasonable profit. I'm looking forward to doing business with you.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a price that's closer to the original offer I made. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer.",13750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. That shows me you're serious about making a deal. However, I still feel we can find a price that works better for both of us. I understand you need to make a profit, and I respect that. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, which gives you a $1000 profit on your investment while still being a fair price for me. What do you say to that?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come up to $13000. However, I'm still a bit short of where I'd like to be. Considering we're getting close, I'm willing to make a small concession to try and finalize the deal. I can offer you the product for $13500, which I believe is a fair compromise between our positions.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, we're definitely getting closer. I appreciate you coming down to $13500. I can see we're both making concessions to reach a fair agreement. To meet you partway, I'm willing to raise my offer to $13200. This gives you a solid $1200 profit while still being a good deal for me. I think this is a reasonable compromise that works for both of us. What do you think?",13200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $13200. I appreciate the effort you're putting into finding a mutually beneficial price. We're indeed very close, and I'm willing to make one more small concession to try and seal the deal. I can offer you the product for $13400, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price considering our negotiations so far.",13400.0,Alice,7,
