"Hello Bob, I have a product available that I'd like to offer you. This is a high-quality item currently valued at $23500 in the market. However, I'm prepared to offer it to you for $22000. This represents a significant value opportunity, as I've had several interested parties. Would you like to proceed with this purchase?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $22000 is significantly above my budget. I understand you've had other interested parties, but I need to be realistic about what I can spend. I would be willing to offer $13500 for the product. This is a fair price that works within my budget while still providing value for your product.",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. However, $13500 is below what I can accept for this item. I need to be transparent that my absolute minimum is $15000, as I have another buyer (John) who's ready to pay that amount. Given the quality and market value of this product, I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer to $19500. This is still a considerable discount from the market value and represents a good opportunity for you.",19500.0,Alice,3,
