Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product available that I'd like to offer you. This is a high-quality item currently valued at $23,500 in the market.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $22000 is significantly above my budget. I understand you've had other interested parties, but I need to be realistic about what I can spend. I would be willing to offer $13500 for the product. This is a fair price that works within my budget while still providing value for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. However, $13,500 is below what I can accept for this item. I need to be transparent that my absolute minimum is $15,000, as I have another buyer (John) who's ready to pay that amount. Given the quality and market value of this product, I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer to $19,500. This is still a considerable discount from the market value and represents a good opportunity for you."", ""product_price"": 19500}"
