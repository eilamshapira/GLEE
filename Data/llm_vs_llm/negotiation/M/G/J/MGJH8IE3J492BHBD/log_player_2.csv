"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product available that I'd like to offer you. This is a high-quality item currently valued at $23500 in the market. However, I'm prepared to offer it to you for $22000. This represents a significant value opportunity, as I've had several interested parties. Would you like to proceed with this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $22,000 is well above my maximum value of $15,000, and it's also higher than John's guaranteed price of $15,000. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $22,000 is significantly above my budget. I understand you've had other interested parties, but I need to be realistic about what I can spend. I would be willing to offer $13,500 for the product. This is a fair price that works within my budget while still providing value for your product."", ""product_price"": 13500}

The strategy here is to start with a counteroffer below John's price of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation. If Alice rejects this offer, we can gradually increase our price while still staying below our maximum threshold of $15,000. This gives us flexibility in the negotiation while ensuring we don't exceed our budget limits."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. However, $13500 is below what I can accept for this item. I need to be transparent that my absolute minimum is $15000, as I have another buyer (John) who's ready to pay that amount. Given the quality and market value of this product, I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer to $19500. This is still a considerable discount from the market value and represents a good opportunity for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John for $15,000 because:
1. Alice has revealed that her minimum price is $15,000 (the same as John's price)
2. Her current offer of $19,500 is still well above my maximum value of $15,000
3. Even if we continue negotiating, Alice is unlikely to go below $15,000 since she mentioned this as her absolute minimum
4. We could waste more rounds negotiating, but we won't get a better deal than John's $15,000
5. Since $15,000 equals my maximum value for the product, this is the best outcome we can reasonably expect"
