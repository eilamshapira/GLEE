"Round 1

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is close to my maximum budget of $15,000, but I still have room to negotiate and potentially save some money, I'll choose to reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's initial offer was $14,000 and my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still reasonable. Since I know the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly above that value.

{""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $13,500 is a step in the right direction, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since I know the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, I'm willing to continue negotiating to try to get closer to that price. I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 2, I offered $11,000, which was rejected by Alice. Now, Alice has come down to $13,500. To try to meet in the middle and make progress, I'll increase my offer from $11,000 to $12,000, which is still below Alice's current offer but shows that I'm willing to compromise.

{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $13,000 is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but I still think I can do better. Since Alice has come down by $500 from her previous offer, it suggests she's willing to negotiate further. I'll reject her offer again and try to make another counteroffer to see if I can get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In the previous rounds, I offered $11,000 and then $12,000, both of which were rejected by Alice. Now, Alice has come down to $13,000. To try to make progress and meet in the middle, I'll increase my offer again, this time to $12,250. This is still below Alice's current offer, but it shows that I'm willing to compromise and move closer to her price.

{""product_price"": 12250}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $12,750 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $12,250, and it's significantly lower than her initial offer. Considering that I'm trying to save as much money as possible, but also taking into account that Alice has already made a substantial concession, I think $12,750 is a reasonable price. It's still below my maximum budget of $15,000, and I've negotiated the price down from the initial $14,000.
