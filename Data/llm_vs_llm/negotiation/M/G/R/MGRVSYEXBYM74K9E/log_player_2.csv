"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you the product for $11000. I believe it can bring you great value! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $11,000, I need to consider my options carefully.

The product is worth at most $8,000 to me, so paying $11,000 would mean I'm losing $3,000 in value. 

I have the option to buy from John for exactly $8,000, which matches my maximum valuation. While I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, there's no guarantee she'll accept a price below $8,000 since the product is worth $12,000 to her.

Given that I can get the product at exactly my maximum valuation right now from John, that's the most rational decision.
