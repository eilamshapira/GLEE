Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $15,000 to Bob
2. Bob will only accept if he gets some value from the deal
3. If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed $12,000 from John
4. I should leave some room for Bob to profit while maximizing my earnings

I'll offer a price that gives Bob some value while being significantly better than my fallback option of $12,000.

{""product_price"": 14000}

This price gives Bob $1,000 in value ($15,000 - $14,000) while giving me $2,000 more than my fallback option with John."
