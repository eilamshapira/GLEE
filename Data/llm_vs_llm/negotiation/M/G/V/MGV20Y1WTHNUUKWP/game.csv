"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $120 is beyond my budget for this item. The market rate for similar products is actually closer to $70-80. I'd like to counteroffer $60 for the product, which I believe is fair given current market conditions. I'm looking forward to reaching an agreement that works for both of us.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, I must consider the product's value and the other offers I have on the table. Given the market rate you mentioned, I'm willing to make a concession, but I still believe the product is worth more than $60. I'd like to counteroffer $100, which I think is a fair compromise between our initial offers.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down in price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $100 is still outside my budget for this item. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $80. I'd really prefer to do business with you, so I'm willing to offer $70, which would save me a bit while giving you a better deal than what I'd pay elsewhere. Does that work for you?",70.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your honesty about the other offer you have on the table. I appreciate your preference to do business with me, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your budget constraints and the competing offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and John's price. I'd like to counteroffer $90, which I believe is a fair compromise and still reflects the product's value.",90.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down further in price. You're getting closer to a range that would work for me. However, I need to be practical about this purchase. John's offer of $80 is the absolute maximum I can justify spending on this product based on my budget and the product's value to me. To make it worth choosing you over John, I'd need a slightly better deal. My final offer is $75 - this gives you a sale and gives me a small savings compared to my alternative. I hope we can close the deal at this price.",75.0,Bob,6,
