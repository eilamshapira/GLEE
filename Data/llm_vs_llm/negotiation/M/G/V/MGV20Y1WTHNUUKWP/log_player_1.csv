"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its exceptional quality and value, I'm starting with a competitive price. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $120 is beyond my budget for this item. The market rate for similar products is actually closer to $70-80. I'd like to counteroffer $60 for the product, which I believe is fair given current market conditions. I'm looking forward to reaching an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $60 is below the minimum value of the product to me ($80) and also lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, I must consider the product's value and the other offers I have on the table. Given the market rate you mentioned, I'm willing to make a concession, but I still believe the product is worth more than $60. I'd like to counteroffer $100, which I think is a fair compromise between our initial offers."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down in price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $100 is still outside my budget for this item. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $80. I'd really prefer to do business with you, so I'm willing to offer $70, which would save me a bit while giving you a better deal than what I'd pay elsewhere. Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $70 is still below the minimum value of the product to me ($80) and also lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I'll try to get closer to the price I'm willing to accept while still being competitive with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your honesty about the other offer you have on the table. I appreciate your preference to do business with me, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your budget constraints and the competing offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and John's price. I'd like to counteroffer $90, which I believe is a fair compromise and still reflects the product's value."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down further in price. You're getting closer to a range that would work for me. However, I need to be practical about this purchase. John's offer of $80 is the absolute maximum I can justify spending on this product based on my budget and the product's value to me. To make it worth choosing you over John, I'd need a slightly better deal. My final offer is $75 - this gives you a sale and gives me a small savings compared to my alternative. I hope we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $75 is still below the minimum value of the product to me ($80) and John is willing to pay $80, I will choose to sell the product to John. This option guarantees me the minimum value I'm willing to accept, and further negotiations with Bob may not yield a better result."
