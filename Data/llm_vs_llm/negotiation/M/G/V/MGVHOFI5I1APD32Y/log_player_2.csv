"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given that Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is $200,000 less than John's price of $1,200,000, and also less than my maximum valuation of $1,200,000, this is a good offer. I should accept Alice's offer to maximize my savings.
