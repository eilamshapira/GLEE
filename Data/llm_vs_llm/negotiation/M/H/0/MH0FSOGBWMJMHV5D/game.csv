"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know if you'd like to take it at this price!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. The product sounds interesting, but $150 is above what I'm willing to pay. Based on my research and budget, I can offer $50 for it. This is a fair starting point considering similar products in the market. Let me know if this works for you.",50.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $50 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $125? Let me know if this works for you.",125.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that we're still a bit apart on the price. I'm willing to lower it further to $115. This is a good deal considering the value of the product. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $115 is still more than I can spend on this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $80, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $65 for the product. This is a better price for me while still giving you a fair deal. What do you think?",65.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and your preference to do business with me. However, $65 is still below my minimum price. I can go down to $110, which is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",110.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower the price to $105, but this is as low as I can go while still making it worthwhile for me. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down to $105, Alice. I can see you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, I need to be transparent - I have a firm budget constraint and another seller is offering the same product for $80. I'd still prefer to buy from you if possible, so my best offer is $75. This is the absolute most I can spend while still making this purchase worthwhile for me. Can we make this work?",75.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your transparency and your desire to work with me. However, $75 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to go down to $102, which is my final offer before I have to consider selling to another buyer. Let me know if this works for you.",102.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to stick to a price that works for me as well. My final offer is $101. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. Let me know what you decide.",101.0,Alice,7,
