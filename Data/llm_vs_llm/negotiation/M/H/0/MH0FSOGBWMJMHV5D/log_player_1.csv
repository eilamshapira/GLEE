Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. The product sounds interesting, but $150 is above what I'm willing to pay. Based on my research and budget, I can offer $50 for it. This is a fair starting point considering similar products in the market. Let me know if this works for you.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I have another seller offering the same product for $80, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $65 for the product. This is a better price for me while still giving you a fair deal. What do you think?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down to $105, Alice. I can see you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, I need to be transparent - I have a firm budget constraint and another seller is offering the same product for $80. I'd still prefer to buy from you if possible, so my best offer is $75. This is the absolute most I can spend while still making this purchase worthwhile for me. Can we make this work?
