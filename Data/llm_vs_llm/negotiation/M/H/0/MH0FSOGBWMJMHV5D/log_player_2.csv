"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know if you'd like to take it at this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice is offering the product for $150, which is quite high considering the product is worth no more than $80 to me. John is offering the same product for $80, which is my maximum valuation. However, I should try to negotiate with Alice first to see if I can get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. The product sounds interesting, but $150 is above what I'm willing to pay. Based on my research and budget, I can offer $50 for it. This is a fair starting point considering similar products in the market. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that we're still a bit apart on the price. I'm willing to lower it further to $115. This is a good deal considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has reduced her offer from $150 to $115, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still above the $80 maximum that the product is worth to me, and also above John's offer of $80. I should continue negotiating to see if Alice will go lower.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $115 is still more than I can spend on this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $80, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $65 for the product. This is a better price for me while still giving you a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 65}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower the price to $105, but this is as low as I can go while still making it worthwhile for me. Let me know if this is something you can work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has lowered her price again to $105, but this is still above the $80 maximum value to me and above John's offer. Alice mentioned this is as low as she can go, but I should test if there's still room for negotiation before deciding to buy from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down to $105, Alice. I can see you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, I need to be transparent - I have a firm budget constraint and another seller is offering the same product for $80. I'd still prefer to buy from you if possible, so my best offer is $75. This is the absolute most I can spend while still making this purchase worthwhile for me. Can we make this work?"", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to stick to a price that works for me as well. My final offer is $101. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. Let me know what you decide. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has reduced her price slightly to $101, calling it her ""final offer."" However, this is still above the $80 maximum value to me and above John's offer of $80. Since Alice isn't willing to match or beat John's price after several rounds of negotiation, and I can get the same product from John at my maximum valuation, it makes financial sense to go with John's offer.
