Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $250. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's quite steep for me. How about I offer you $60 instead? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counter-offer since $60 is significantly below my minimum value of $150, and I can always sell to John for $150. Let me try to negotiate with Bob for a better price.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $60 is too low for this product. I can offer it to you for $200. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and the product's quality justifies this value."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $60 is too low for this product. I can offer it to you for $200. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and the product's quality justifies this value."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice, but $200 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle - how about $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $80 is still well below my minimum value of $150, and his second offer only increased by $20, it seems unlikely we'll reach a price above $150. Therefore, I'll take the guaranteed $150 from John rather than continue negotiations that appear unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price."
