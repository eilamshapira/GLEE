"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $5000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5000 is significantly below its true value.  This product offers substantial benefits that I believe you'll find worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $15000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you believe the product is worth more, but $15000 is still a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about we settle at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
