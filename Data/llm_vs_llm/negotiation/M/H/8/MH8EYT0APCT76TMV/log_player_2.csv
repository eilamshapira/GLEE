"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great opportunity for you to acquire our exclusive product. I believe it could add significant value to your ventures. I'm offering it to you for the competitive price of $2000000. This offer combines the premium nature of the product with the substantial benefits it could bring. Let me know if you'd like to proceed or discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given that:
- The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to you
- Alice is offering to sell it for $2,000,000
- John is willing to sell it for $1,200,000

Alice's price is significantly higher than both the product's worth to you and John's alternative offer. It would be rational to go with the lower price option.
