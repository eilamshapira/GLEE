Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to start the negotiation with Bob with a reasonable offer. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob and $12,000 to me, I have a negotiation zone of $3,000. I should start on the higher side to leave room for possible concessions while still maximizing my profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I notice that Bob's offer of $11,000 is actually below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. Since I have the option to sell to John for $12,000, I need to make it clear to Bob that I need a better price while still leaving room for negotiation.

Since Bob and John are offering the same amount, and there's potential to negotiate further with Bob to get a better price, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob moved up from $11,000 to $12,000, he's showing willingness to negotiate. I'll lower my asking price a bit to show good faith, but still aim for a price that gives me a better profit than selling to John.
