"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $5000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",5000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,19000.0
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5000 is far too low. Considering the product's quality and value, I'm willing to come down to $19000. This is a fantastic deal.",19000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down from $20000, but $19000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $7000 for the product. It's a reasonable price, and I'm hoping we can work something out.",7000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,18000.0
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I can't go that low. My absolute lowest price is $18000. This is the best I can do. Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I might have to explore other options.",18000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7500, which is the highest I'm comfortable with. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",7500.0,Bob,6,,
