"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $60. I understand that you're interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a higher price. I'm willing to consider a discount, but I need to get at least closer to my target price. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to consider a discount. However, $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new offer. How about we do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to my limit, but I'm willing to make one more adjustment. Considering your previous offers and my target price, I'm willing to meet you at $95. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. If we can't agree on this, I do have another buyer interested in the product for $100, so I need to consider that option as well.",95.0,Alice,5,
