Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to meet him at a price that's closer to my target of at least $100. Since Bob is interested in the product and has made an offer of $60, I'll try to find a middle ground that's still favorable to me. My next offer will be $90."

I understand that you're interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a higher price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to consider a discount. However, $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new offer. How about we do $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since he's willing to meet me halfway between his previous offer of $60 and my offer of $90, and has now offered $75, I'll try to find a price that's closer to my target of at least $100. My next offer will be $95, but considering Bob's willingness to negotiate, I might be able to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I also have the option to sell to John for $100, so I need to keep that in mind.

Considering your previous offers and my target price, I'm willing to meet you at $95. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. If we can't agree on this, I do have another buyer interested in the product for $100, so I need to consider that option as well."", ""product_price"": 95}"
