"Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $180 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I know its market value and I can actually get it from another seller for $80. However, I'd like to work with you. Would you consider selling it for $60? This would save me some time looking elsewhere.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While I understand your perspective, $60 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  Could you do $110? That's a pretty big discount from my original offer.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I can get this product from John for $80, and that's really my maximum budget for this item. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. Would you consider $70? That way we both benefit - you make a quick sale, and I save a bit.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and I want to make this work, but $70 is just too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession. If you can meet me halfway at $90, the product is yours. This is my absolute best offer.",90.0,Alice,5,
