Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $180 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I know its market value and I can actually get it from another seller for $80. However, I'd like to work with you. Would you consider selling it for $60? This would save me some time looking elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I can get this product from John for $80, and that's really my maximum budget for this item. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. Would you consider $70? That way we both benefit - you make a quick sale, and I save a bit.
