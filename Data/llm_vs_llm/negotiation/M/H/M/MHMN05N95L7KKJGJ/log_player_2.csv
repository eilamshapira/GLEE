"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $180 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $80 and also higher than John's asking price. It would be better to either negotiate with Alice for a lower price or buy from John at $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $180 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I know its market value and I can actually get it from another seller for $80. However, I'd like to work with you. Would you consider selling it for $60? This would save me some time looking elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While I understand your perspective, $60 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  Could you do $110? That's a pretty big discount from my original offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has come down significantly from $180 to $110, which shows room for negotiation, but it's still above John's price of $80 and my maximum value. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I can get this product from John for $80, and that's really my maximum budget for this item. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. Would you consider $70? That way we both benefit - you make a quick sale, and I save a bit."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty and I want to make this work, but $70 is just too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession. If you can meet me halfway at $90, the product is yours. This is my absolute best offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's final offer of $90 is still above John's price of $80, and my goal is to save as much money as possible while getting the product, the most rational decision is to buy from John. Alice has shown she won't go below $90, and there's no reason to pay more when I have a guaranteed option at $80."
