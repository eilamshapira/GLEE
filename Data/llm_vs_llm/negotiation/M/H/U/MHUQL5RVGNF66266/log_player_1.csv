Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm offering it to you for $250."", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. How about I offer you $100 instead? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
