"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: Pay $1,000,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: Pay $1,000,000

Since Alice's offer ($1,000,000) is exactly the same as John's price ($1,000,000), and the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, there's no monetary advantage in choosing one option over another. All options will cost the same amount.

In this case, since there's no price difference, I might as well accept Alice's current offer rather than going through the hassle of rejecting and buying from John.
