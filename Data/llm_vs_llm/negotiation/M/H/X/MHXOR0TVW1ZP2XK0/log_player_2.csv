"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $80 to Alice
2. The product is worth up to $120 to me
3. I have John's offer of $120 as a backup
4. Alice's current offer of $100 is $20 less than John's price
5. However, since the product is worth $80 to Alice, there might be room for negotiation to get an even better price

Given these factors, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. Even if negotiations don't work out, I can always fall back to John's offer of $120.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than Alice's cost ($80) but lower than her current offer ($100). I'll try $85, which would give Alice a small profit while saving me more money.

{""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $100 to $95, showing willingness to negotiate
2. My counteroffer of $85 was rejected, suggesting Alice wants more than that
3. $95 is still $25 less than John's price of $120
4. We could continue negotiating, but there's a risk Alice might not go much lower
5. $95 is a reasonable price, giving me a good savings compared to John's price

Given this, I think it's wise to accept this offer. Further negotiation might not yield much better results, and we risk losing this deal.
