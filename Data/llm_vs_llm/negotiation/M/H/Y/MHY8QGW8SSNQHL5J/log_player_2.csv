"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’ve got a great offer for you on a top-quality product. I’m offering it for $150—a price that reflects its premium value. Let me know if you’d like to move forward with this purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $150
2. John is also selling it for $150
3. The product is worth no more than $150 to me
4. Both offers are at the maximum price I'm willing to pay

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($150), and I know that:
- The product is worth $100 to Alice
- Alice might be willing to negotiate to a lower price if I reject first offer
- John's price is fixed at $150

The best strategy would be to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: By rejecting Alice's initial offer, there's a possibility she might come back with a lower price, knowing the product costs her $100. If she doesn't, I can still buy from John at $150 later, so I'm not losing anything by rejecting first."
