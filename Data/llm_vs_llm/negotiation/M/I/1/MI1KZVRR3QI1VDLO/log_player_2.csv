"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's initial offer is already at the maximum price I'm willing to pay, and I have the option to buy the product from John for the same price, I don't see any benefit in accepting Alice's offer immediately. However, I also don't want to give up the potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I don't know the value of the product to Alice, I'll start with a price that is half of my maximum budget.

{""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer is $1,400,000, which is $100,000 less than her initial offer and $100,000 less than what I can buy it from John. This suggests that she is willing to negotiate, but still wants a high price for the product.

I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal. Since Alice has already come down by $100,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between her new offer and my previous counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To calculate my next counteroffer, I'll find the midpoint between Alice's new offer ($1,400,000) and my previous counteroffer ($750,000).

Midpoint = ($1,400,000 + $750,000) / 2 = $1,075,000

I'll use this midpoint as my new counteroffer.

{""product_price"": 1075000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has come down another $100,000 from her previous offer of $1,400,000. This suggests that she is still willing to negotiate, but the price is getting closer to my maximum budget.

I'll consider my options:

* Accepting the offer of $1,300,000 would save me $200,000 compared to buying from John.
* Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer could potentially save me even more, but it also risks Alice not being willing to negotiate further.
* Buying from John would give me no potential for further savings.

Since I still have 5 rounds left to negotiate, I'll try to make another counteroffer to see if I can get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round. 

In the next round, I will offer $1,200,000, which is $100,000 less than Alice's current offer, but still higher than my previous counteroffer of $1,075,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","As previously decided, my counteroffer is:
