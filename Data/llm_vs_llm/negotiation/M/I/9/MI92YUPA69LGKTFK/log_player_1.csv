Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that I know my product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at that price, I should offer the product to Bob at a significantly higher price. Since I don't know Bob's maximum valuation, I'll set a price that could capture substantial additional value while still being potentially reasonable for a valuable product.
