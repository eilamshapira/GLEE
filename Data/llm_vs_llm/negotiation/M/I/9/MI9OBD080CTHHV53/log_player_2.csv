"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that you value the product at no more than $8,000, and John is offering to sell it to you for exactly $8,000, Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than both your maximum valuation and your alternative option.

The rational choice would be to buy from John at $8,000 rather than accept Alice's much higher price of $15,000.
