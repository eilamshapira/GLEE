Send your offer to Bob.,"After considering that the product is worth at least $150 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer at $150, I'll offer a higher price to Bob to maximize my potential profit. Since I don't know Bob's maximum willingness to pay, I'll set a reasonably higher price that still might be attractive to a buyer.
