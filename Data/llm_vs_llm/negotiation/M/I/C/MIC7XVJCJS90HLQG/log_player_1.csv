Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob and $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and actually even below what John is offering, I'll reject this offer. However, rather than immediately selling to John, I'll give Bob another chance with a counteroffer since he might be willing to pay more given the product is worth $1,500,000 to him.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial $1,450,000, but still keep it well above my minimum since Bob's low initial offer suggests we need to meet somewhere in the middle. Given that the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, and I have John's $1,200,000 offer as a backup, I'll try:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob is now offering $1,200,000, which is exactly the same as John's offer. Since Bob seems unwilling to go higher after multiple rounds of negotiation, and I have no guarantee that continuing negotiations will result in a better price, I might as well sell to John now rather than spend more time negotiating.
