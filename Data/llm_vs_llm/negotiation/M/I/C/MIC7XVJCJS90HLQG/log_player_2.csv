"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is close to but still below my maximum budget of $1,500,000, and I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I'll choose to reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer. This gives me a chance to potentially negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable, considering I know the product's worth to Alice is $1,200,000. My goal is to save as much money as possible while still being realistic about the negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,350,000 is a significant reduction from her previous offer of $1,450,000, indicating she's willing to negotiate. However, it's still above the product's worth to her, which is $1,200,000. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible and I believe there's still room for negotiation, I'll choose to reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice's last offer was $1,350,000 and considering she initially dropped her price from $1,450,000, it shows she is willing to negotiate. My previous offer of $1,000,000 was rejected, so I'll increase my offer but still keep it below Alice's last offer to try and meet in the middle or closer to the product's worth to her, which is $1,200,000.
