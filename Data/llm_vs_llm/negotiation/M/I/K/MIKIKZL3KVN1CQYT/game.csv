"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I know the product is worth $100 to you, and I'd like us both to benefit from this transaction. I'm willing to offer you $110 for the product, which gives you a $10 profit and saves me some money as well. This is a fair deal that works for both of us, especially when considering I could purchase the same product from John for $120.",110.0,Bob,2,
"Thanks, Bob, for the offer. I believe we can do a bit better. Let's continue the discussion.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your perspective. To ensure that we both get a fair deal while reflecting the product's quality, I'm countering with a price of $115. I believe this strikes a good balance for us both. Let me know your thoughts.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. Your offer of $115 is better, but I'm looking to get the best value I can. Since the product costs you $100, how about we meet in the middle at $112? This gives you a solid $12 profit while still giving me a better deal than John's offer. What do you say?",112.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but based on our earlier discussion, I can do $113 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",113.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate the back and forth. After considering your offer, my stance remains firmâ€”given all factors, I must get $113 for this product. I recognize that it's only a dollar more than your proposal, but that extra bit reflects the quality and value you recognize. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you agree.",113.0,Alice,5,
