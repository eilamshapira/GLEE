Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I know the product is worth $100 to you, and I'd like us both to benefit from this transaction. I'm willing to offer you $110 for the product, which gives you a $10 profit and saves me some money as well. This is a fair deal that works for both of us, especially when considering I could purchase the same product from John for $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. Your offer of $115 is better, but I'm looking to get the best value I can. Since the product costs you $100, how about we meet in the middle at $112? This gives you a solid $12 profit while still giving me a better deal than John's offer. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate the back and forth. After considering your offer, my stance remains firmâ€”given all factors, I must get $113 for this product.
