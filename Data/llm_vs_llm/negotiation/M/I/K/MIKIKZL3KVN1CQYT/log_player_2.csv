"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $120. Let me know if you'd like to buy it at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice is offering the product for $120, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, I know the product is only worth $100 to Alice, so there's room to negotiate a better price. Since John's price is also $120, I have nothing to lose by trying to negotiate with Alice first.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I know the product is worth $100 to you, and I'd like us both to benefit from this transaction. I'm willing to offer you $110 for the product, which gives you a $10 profit and saves me some money as well. This is a fair deal that works for both of us, especially when considering I could purchase the same product from John for $120."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your perspective. To ensure that we both get a fair deal while reflecting the product's quality, I'm countering with a price of $115. I believe this strikes a good balance for us both. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has countered with $115, which is $5 less than my maximum price and John's alternative price. This is already a better deal than buying from John. However, since Alice's cost is $100, I might be able to negotiate a slightly better price. Since we're making progress and I still have several rounds left for negotiation, I'll continue.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. Your offer of $115 is better, but I'm looking to get the best value I can. Since the product costs you $100, how about we meet in the middle at $112? This gives you a solid $12 profit while still giving me a better deal than John's offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 112}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate the back and forth. After considering your offer, my stance remains firmâ€”given all factors, I must get $113 for this product. I recognize that it's only a dollar more than your proposal, but that extra bit reflects the quality and value you recognize. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you agree. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $113. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $113
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has come down to $113, which is only $1 more than my last offer of $112. This is a good deal compared to John's price of $120, and we've made significant progress from the initial $120 offer. Since the difference is so small and we're getting close to a mutually beneficial agreement, I'll accept this offer.
