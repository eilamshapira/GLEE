"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($1,000,000) and John's alternative offer ($1,000,000). It would not be rational to accept this offer when I have a better alternative. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, starting lower to leave room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

Rationale: I'll start with a counteroffer of $800,000, which is strategically low but not unreasonable. This gives me room to negotiate upward while staying below my maximum value of $1,000,000. If Alice rejects this, I can gradually increase my offer in subsequent rounds, but I always have the safety net of John's $1,000,000 offer. Given that the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, there might be room for a mutually beneficial deal between $800,000 and $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: Alice has only slightly reduced her price from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000, which is still significantly above both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's offer ($1,000,000). While Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate by lowering the price, the current offer is still not acceptable. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, aiming to find a middle ground. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement soon, I always have the option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 900000}

Rationale: I'm increasing my offer from $800,000 to $900,000 to show good faith in the negotiation and demonstrate willingness to move toward a middle ground. This price is:
1. Still below my maximum value ($1,000,000)
2. Still gives me a better deal than John's offer ($1,000,000)
3. Shows significant movement from my previous offer
4. While still leaving Alice room to make a profit (as the product is worth $1,200,000 to her)

If Alice rejects this offer, I can either make one more higher offer or consider taking John's offer, as we're now in round 4 and need to be mindful of the 10-round limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Rationale: While Alice has been gradually reducing her price (from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000 to $1,300,000), she's still significantly above my maximum value of $1,000,000. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and the gap between our positions remains too large. Alice's current offer of $1,300,000 is still $300,000 more than John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000. Given that:
1. Alice seems unwilling to come down to a price near my maximum value
2. We're halfway through our negotiation rounds
3. I have a guaranteed option at $1,000,000 from John
4. The price difference is still substantial

It's best to take John's offer now rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that may not lead to a better outcome."
