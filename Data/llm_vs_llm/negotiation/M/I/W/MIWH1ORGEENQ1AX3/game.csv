"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity. Considering the immense value this product will bring to you, I'm confident you'll see the merit in my initial offer. I'm willing to let it go for $950000.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be straightforward with you. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $800000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Could you consider a price of $700000? This would give me some savings compared to my alternative option while still providing you with a sale.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you being upfront. While I understand your position, the product holds significant value, and I'm hesitant to drop the price too drastically. Knowing you value it at $800000 and have another offer at that price, how about we meet in the middle? I'll offer it to you for $875000. This gives you a small premium for working with me while still reflecting the true worth of the product.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for working with me on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $875000 is still above what makes economic sense for me. As I mentioned, I have John's offer at $800000, which is already my maximum budget for this product. To make it worthwhile to choose you over my alternative, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $750000, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still providing you with a reasonable deal for a product that's worth $800000 to you.",750000.0,Bob,4,
