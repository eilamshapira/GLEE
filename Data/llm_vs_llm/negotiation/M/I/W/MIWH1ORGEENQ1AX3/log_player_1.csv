Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be straightforward with you. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $800000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Could you consider a price of $700000? This would give me some savings compared to my alternative option while still providing you with a sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being upfront. While I understand your position, the product holds significant value, and I'm hesitant to drop the price too drastically. Knowing you value it at $800,000 and have another offer at that price, how about we meet in the middle? I'll offer it to you for $875,000. This gives you a small premium for working with me while still reflecting the true worth of the product."", ""product_price"": 875000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for working with me on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $875000 is still above what makes economic sense for me. As I mentioned, I have John's offer at $800000, which is already my maximum budget for this product. To make it worthwhile to choose you over my alternative, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $750000, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still providing you with a reasonable deal for a product that's worth $800000 to you.
