"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity. Considering the immense value this product will bring to you, I'm confident you'll see the merit in my initial offer. I'm willing to let it go for $950000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","The offer from Alice is $950,000, which is higher than the product's worth to me ($800,000) and also higher than John's guaranteed price of $800,000. Since I want to save as much money as possible, and Alice's current offer would actually cost me more than my maximum valuation, I should not accept it.

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $800,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Could you consider a price of $700,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you being upfront. While I understand your position, the product holds significant value, and I'm hesitant to drop the price too drastically. Knowing you value it at $800000 and have another offer at that price, how about we meet in the middle? I'll offer it to you for $875000. This gives you a small premium for working with me while still reflecting the true worth of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for working with me on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $875,000 is still above what makes economic sense for me. As I mentioned, I have John's offer at $800,000, which is already my maximum budget for this product. To make it worthwhile to choose you over my alternative, I'd need a better price.
