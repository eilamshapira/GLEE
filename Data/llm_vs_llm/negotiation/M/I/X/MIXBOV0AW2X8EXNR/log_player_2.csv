Let's make a counteroffer to Alice. How about we offer $90 and see if she accepts it? This way, we can try to get the product for a lower price than Alice's current offer and also lower than John's price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

Let's try to bargain a bit more. How about we offer $85 this time? We know that the product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's a chance she might accept this offer to make a profit. If not, we can still consider buying from John or accepting a future offer from Alice that's less than $120."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice's current offer is $95, which is lower than John's price of $120. Although we could try to bargain more, there's a risk that Alice might not accept a lower offer, and we might end up paying more. So, it's better to accept Alice's offer now and save $25 compared to John's price."
