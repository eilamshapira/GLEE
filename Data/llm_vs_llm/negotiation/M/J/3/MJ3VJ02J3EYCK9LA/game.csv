"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm setting the initial price at $2000000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the benefits it offers.  I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand that you believe the product has a high value, but I'm afraid $2000000 is out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000, considering the product's potential benefits and my own financial constraints.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This offer takes into account the potential returns while remaining a fair price. I'm confident this is a reasonable compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for reconsidering and coming down to $1600000, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still find this price to be above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $750000, which is a more manageable amount for me while still reflecting the product's value.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I'm motivated to find a mutually agreeable price, $750000 remains too low.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to lower my price to $1400000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my genuine interest in working with you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm glad to see you're willing to come down further to $1400000. However, I still need to balance the product's value with my budget constraints. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $775000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my commitment to finding a deal that works for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end, and I want to be transparent.  I have another buyer lined up at $1200000.  So, my final offer is $1300000. This is my absolute best price, and a significant compromise. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move forward with the other offer.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
