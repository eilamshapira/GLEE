"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I'm looking to spend no more than $8000 for this product. I believe this price reflects its value more accurately, given my budget and the market conditions. Would you be willing to accept this price? I'm open to finding a middle ground if this doesn't work for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is significantly below its value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12500. This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer lined up at this price.",12500.0,Alice,3,
