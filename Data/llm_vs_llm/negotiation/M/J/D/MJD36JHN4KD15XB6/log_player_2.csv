"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I know you value this product at $10000, and I know it will be incredibly useful for you. I'm offering it to you for $12000. It's an investment that will pay off handsomely. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $12,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John at $10,000

Since:
- The product is worth $10,000 to me
- Alice is offering it for $12,000 (which is $2,000 more than its value to me)
- John is offering it for $10,000 (exactly what it's worth to me)
- My goal is to save as much money as possible

The logical choice is to buy from John for $10,000, as it would save me $2,000 compared to Alice's offer.
