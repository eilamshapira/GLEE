This product is of exceptional quality and value, and I believe it would be a significant asset for you.

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of your product, $1300000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. This price is fair considering my budget and the potential value the product will bring to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, I need to consider the true value of what I'm offering. The product is worth significantly more than $1100000 in the market. However, I'm willing to meet you partway. I can offer it to you for $1225000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's genuine value. This price point allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. I hope we can reach an agreement.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1225000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1162500. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",1162500.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I can see you're genuinely interested in acquiring this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I can offer you the product for $1200000. This is very close to our middle ground and represents my final price point. At this price, you'll still realize $300000 in value from the purchase, which is a significant return. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us and allows us to conclude our negotiation successfully. I look forward to your positive response.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
