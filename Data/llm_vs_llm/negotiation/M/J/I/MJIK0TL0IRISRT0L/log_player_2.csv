Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, I need to consider the true value of what I'm offering. The product is worth significantly more than $1100000 in the market. However, I'm willing to meet you partway. I can offer it to you for $1225000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's genuine value. This price point allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. I hope we can reach an agreement.

# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I can see you're genuinely interested in acquiring this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I can offer you the product for $1200000. This is very close to our middle ground and represents my final price point.
