"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Looking at the options:

Alice's offer is $9,500, which is less than John's price of $10,000.

Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and Alice's price is $500 less than what John would charge, accepting Alice's offer would save me money.
