Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me analyze this situation:

1. My minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000 (as I can sell to John for this amount)
2. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob
3. Since Bob knows the product's value to him, he won't accept any offer above $1,000,000

Given that Bob's maximum value ($1,000,000) is less than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), there is no price point where we can reach a deal. Any negotiation would be futile since I can always sell to John for a better price.

Therefore, I should just skip the negotiation process and sell to John directly.
