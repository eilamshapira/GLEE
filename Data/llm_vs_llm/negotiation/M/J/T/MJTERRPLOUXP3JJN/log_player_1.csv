Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I believe $11500 is a bit high. Given market conditions, I would be comfortable purchasing it for $10500. This represents a solid profit margin while still being a fair price for both of us. What are your thoughts on this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
