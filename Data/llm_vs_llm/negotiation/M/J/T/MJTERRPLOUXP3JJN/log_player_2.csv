"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11500. I believe it presents significant value at this price point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $12,000
2. Alice's offer is $11,500, which is below my maximum
3. John's fixed price is $12,000
4. Alice's cost is $10,000, so there's room for negotiation

The current offer ($11,500) is better than John's price ($12,000), but since I know Alice's cost is $10,000, there's potential to negotiate a better deal. A counteroffer could lead to a more favorable price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but leaves room for negotiation:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I believe $11,500 is a bit high. Given market conditions, I would be comfortable purchasing it for $10,500. This represents a solid profit margin while still being a fair price for both of us. What are your thoughts on this?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the current market.  While $10500 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $11000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

1. Alice has reduced the price from $11,500 to $11,000 (a $500 reduction)
2. This is $1,000 better than John's price of $12,000
3. The new price point represents:
   - A $1,000 savings from my maximum value ($12,000)
   - A $1,000 profit for Alice from her cost ($10,000)

This seems like a fair compromise as:
- Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by making a substantial reduction
- The price point is equidistant from both our positions
- Further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely
- The savings compared to John's price is significant
