"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth up to $150 for me
2. Alice's offer is $120
3. John's price is $150
4. Alice's offer saves me $30 compared to John's price

Since Alice's offer of $120 is:
- Below my maximum value ($150)
- Lower than the alternative option from John ($150)
- A reasonable price considering the product's worth to Alice ($80)

The logical choice would be to accept Alice's offer as it saves me $30 compared to buying from John.
