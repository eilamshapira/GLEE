"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product and I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a high offer. 

{""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,500,000, I will not accept Bob's offer.

However, I still want to explore the possibility of getting a better deal from Bob, so I won't sell to John just yet.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $500,000, which is very low, I'll make a counteroffer that is still high, but slightly lower than my initial offer, to show that I'm willing to negotiate.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $600,000 is still significantly lower than the minimum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me. While it's an increase from his previous offer, it's not enough to make it an attractive option.

I'll reject Bob's offer again and try to make another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer is still quite low, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous one, but still reflects the high value I place on the product.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $700,000 is still below the minimum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me. At this point, I'm starting to think that Bob may not be willing or able to meet my price expectations.

However, I'll give it a few more rounds to see if we can get closer to a deal. I'll reject Bob's offer again and try to make another counteroffer.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offers are slowly increasing, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous one, but still above the minimum value that I'm willing to accept.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $800,000 is still significantly lower than my counteroffer of $1,750,000 and the minimum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me. We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I don't think Bob is going to meet my price expectations.

At this point, I think it's more likely that I'll get a better deal from John, who is willing to pay $1,500,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and consider selling to John.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is the final round, and Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below the minimum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me. I've given Bob multiple opportunities to meet my price expectations, and he hasn't been able to do so.

At this point, I think it's clear that selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best option. It's a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum value, and it's better than accepting a lower offer from Bob.
