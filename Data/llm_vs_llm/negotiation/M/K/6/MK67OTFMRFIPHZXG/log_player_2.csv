"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product! I'm willing to let it go for $200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to analyze the options carefully.

Alice is offering the product for $200, which exceeds the maximum value of $100 that the product is worth to me.

John (not Jhon as misspelled in the options) is offering the same product for $100, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, the rational choice is to buy from John for $100 rather than accept Alice's offer of $200.
