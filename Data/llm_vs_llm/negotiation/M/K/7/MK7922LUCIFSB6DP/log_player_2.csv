"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product for $800000. This is a fair, one-time offer, and if you choose not to proceed, I'll be finalizing the sale with another buyer at the same price. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $800,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it at the same price, there is no benefit in accepting her offer. You can get the same product from John for the same price. Therefore, rejecting the offer is the best option."
