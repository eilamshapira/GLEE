"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer. She's offering the product for $14,000. I know the product is worth up to $15,000 to me.

My options:
- Accept Alice's offer: Pay $14,000
- Reject Alice's offer: This would mean I'd have to buy from John for $15,000
- Buy from John for $15,000: This would cost me $1,000 more than Alice's offer

Since Alice's offer ($14,000) is less than John's price ($15,000), and it's within my valuation of the product, I should accept Alice's offer to save $1,000.
