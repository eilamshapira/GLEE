Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000}

Rationale: Since I know that:
1. The product is worth $1,000,000 to me and I won't sell for less
2. Bob values it at $800,000
3. I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000

There's no reason for me to offer Bob a lower price. Bob won't accept any price above $800,000 anyway (as that would be a loss for him), and I won't sell for less than $1,000,000. Therefore, I might as well offer it at $1,000,000, knowing Bob will reject it and I'll sell to John for the same amount."
