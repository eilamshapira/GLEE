"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product here that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you first. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer is exactly at my maximum budget of $12,000 and I can get the same product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in accepting Alice's offer over buying from John. However, rejecting Alice's offer and then buying from John essentially puts me in the same financial position as accepting Alice's offer. Given that I want to save as much money as possible and there's no indication that Alice will lower her price, my best option is to reject Alice's offer and then buy from John, as this keeps my options open in case Alice decides to negotiate, but since the price is already at my limit and John's price is the same, the practical decision is to buy from John.
