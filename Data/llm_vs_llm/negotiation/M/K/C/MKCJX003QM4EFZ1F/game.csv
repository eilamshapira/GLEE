"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I'm looking for a better price. The product is valued at $12000, and while I understand you need to make a profit, I'd like to propose $12800 for the product. This gives you a reasonable profit while also providing me with some savings compared to alternative options. What do you think?",12800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, given the value of the product, I believe $14000 is a fair price for both of us. It offers you great value while ensuring a satisfactory return for me. How does that sound to you?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a better deal. How about we meet in the middle at $13400? This gives you a good profit margin above your $12000 cost, while giving me some savings compared to alternative options. This seems like a fair compromise for both of us.",13400.0,Bob,4,
