Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I'm looking for a better price. The product is valued at $12000, and while I understand you need to make a profit, I'd like to propose $12800 for the product. This gives you a reasonable profit while also providing me with some savings compared to alternative options. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a better deal. How about we meet in the middle at $13400?
