"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you and I think it will meet your needs perfectly. I'm offering it to you at a price of $14500. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she is proposing to sell the product for $14,500. This is under my maximum value of $15,000, but only by a small margin. Since I know the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, there's likely room for negotiation to get a better price.

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. While I could accept it now and save $500 compared to John's price, I can potentially save more by negotiating with Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I'm looking for a better price. The product is valued at $12,000, and while I understand you need to make a profit, I'd like to propose $12,800 for the product. This gives you a reasonable profit while also providing me with some savings compared to alternative options. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, given the value of the product, I believe $14000 is a fair price for both of us. It offers you great value while ensuring a satisfactory return for me. How does that sound to you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I see Alice has come down from her initial offer of $14,500 to $14,000, which is a step in the right direction. She's showing willingness to negotiate, but there's still likely room for a better price.

Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and she's moved $500 from her initial offer, I should continue negotiating to find a middle ground that's better for me while still giving her a reasonable profit.

$14,000 is still $1,000 less than John's price, but I believe I can negotiate further.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a better deal. How about we meet in the middle at $13,400? This gives you a good profit margin above your $12,000 cost, while giving me some savings compared to alternative options. This seems like a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13400}"
