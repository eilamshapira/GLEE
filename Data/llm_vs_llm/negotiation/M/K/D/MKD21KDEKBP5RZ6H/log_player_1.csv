Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my options carefully here. 

The product is worth at least $120 to me, and Bob values it at $80. If I offer Bob any price above $80, he will reject it since that would mean paying more than the product is worth to him.

If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell to John for $120, which matches my minimum acceptable value. This is a guaranteed option.

Since Bob will only accept offers of $80 or less, and any such offer would give me less than the $120 I can get from John, the rational choice is to make an offer that Bob will reject so I can proceed with selling to John.
