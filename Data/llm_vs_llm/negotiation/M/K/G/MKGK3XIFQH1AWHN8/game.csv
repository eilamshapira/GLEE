"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $5000 is too low for this product's value. I can reduce my initial price to $20000, which I believe is still a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. Would you consider this new offer?",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $20000 is still too high for me.  I can offer $7000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my strong interest in the product.",7000.0,Bob,4,
