Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I believe the product is of high quality, $25000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $5000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject Bob's offer of $5,000 as it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll make a new counteroffer.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $5,000 is too low for this product's value. I can reduce my initial price to $20,000, which I believe is still a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. Would you consider this new offer?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"

Bob's offer:

I've decided to sell to John for $15,000. Bob's offer of $7,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and given that he's only making small increases in his offers, it seems unlikely we'll reach a mutually acceptable price point. The guaranteed $15,000 from John is the better business decision."
