"Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, and I'm excited about the possibility of acquiring it.

"Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I still believe the price of $1375000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $1325000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'd still like to see if we can meet at a slightly lower price point. Considering our previous discussions, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1275000.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Okay Bob, let's try this. I can come down to $1300000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's a significant discount and I believe reflects a very fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your statement that $1300000 is the lowest you're willing to go, but I'd like to make one more attempt to see if we can meet at a slightly lower price point. Considering we're very close, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1287500, which is roughly the midpoint between my previous offer and your current offer.",1287500.0,Bob,8,
