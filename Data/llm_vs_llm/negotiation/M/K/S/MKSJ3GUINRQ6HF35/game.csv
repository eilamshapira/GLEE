"Bob, I'm offering you a truly unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Its value and potential impact are substantial. Given its unique qualities, I'm starting the negotiation at $1200000. I believe this investment will yield significant returns for you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, your starting price is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $600000. I believe this is a fair starting point for further negotiation.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's lower than I can accept at this stage. I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's meet in the middle a bit. How about $1100000? This reflects the product's exceptional value and potential for substantial returns.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $1100000 is still beyond my budget. I can stretch to $650000, which I believe is a reasonable increase and demonstrates my commitment to this deal. ",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this. I'm willing to move further, but $650000 is still quite a gap from my minimum acceptable price. How about we try to find some common ground at $1050000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to reach an agreement. I truly believe the product will bring you value that far exceeds this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It seems we're getting closer.  To be completely transparent, my absolute upper limit is $800000. I can't go any higher than that. If you're able to meet this price, I'm ready to close the deal today.  ",800000.0,Bob,6,
