Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 10000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Considering the options:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000:** This is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer:** This allows me to potentially get a better price.
*   **(3) Sell the product to John for $1,000,000:** This guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price.

I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 8000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Given the situation:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000:** This is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer:** This carries risk, as Bob might keep offering even lower prices, or simply reject me completely.
*   **(3) Sell the product to John for $1,000,000:** This guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price, and is significantly better than Bob's latest offer.

I will choose to sell the product to John.
