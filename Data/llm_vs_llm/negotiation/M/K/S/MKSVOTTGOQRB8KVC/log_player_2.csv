You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is way above your maximum price. It makes much more sense to negotiate or go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $500,000}

This is a starting point significantly below John's offer but still leaves room for negotiation if Alice is truly motivated to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice is coming down, $8,000,000 is still far too high. There's plenty of room to negotiate before getting even close to John's offer."

We are increasing our offer slightly to show willingness to move, but we're still far below Alice's current asking price. This should encourage her to make a more reasonable counter-offer if she is serious about selling to us."
