"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer is the same as John's price ($1,200,000), and this is the maximum I'm willing to pay, I should reject and make a counteroffer. There's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice, especially since the product is worth $1,000,000 to her. If the negotiation doesn't work out, I can always fall back on John's offer later.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a price that's somewhat higher than Alice's cost ($1,000,000) but significantly lower than my maximum budget, giving room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 1,050,000}

This offer gives Alice a $50,000 profit while still being significantly below my maximum budget of $1,200,000. If she rejects this, we can still negotiate upward, and I always have John's offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,170,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,170,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her price from $1,200,000 to $1,170,000, which is a $30,000 reduction. This shows she's willing to negotiate, but there might still be room for a better price. The current offer would save me $30,000 compared to John's price, but I think we can do better.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's continue negotiating as we still have John's offer as a backup, and Alice's cost ($1,000,000) suggests there's room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still try to secure a good deal. Since Alice came down to $1,170,000 from $1,200,000, I'll make a reasonable step up from my previous offer of $1,050,000.

{""product_price"": 1,100,000}

This offer gives Alice a $100,000 profit while still being significantly below both her last offer ($1,170,000) and my maximum budget ($1,200,000). It's a reasonable increase from my previous offer and shows I'm willing to negotiate while still trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has now reduced her price to $1,150,000, which is a good movement from her previous offers ($1,200,000 → $1,170,000 → $1,150,000). This would save me $50,000 compared to John's price. While we might be able to negotiate further, there's also a risk that Alice might become less flexible if we push too hard. The current offer gives her a reasonable profit ($150,000) while giving me a decent saving. I think this is a fair price point to accept.
