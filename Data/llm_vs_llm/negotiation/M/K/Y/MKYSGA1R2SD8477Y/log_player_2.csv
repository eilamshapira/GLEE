"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice's initial offer is $95, which is close to my maximum budget, I'll consider rejecting the offer to see if I can get a better deal. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, to see how much she is willing to negotiate. Since I don't know how low she is willing to go, I'll start with a relatively conservative offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I think the product is great, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, say at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $90 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but it's getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with. Since she rejected my previous offer of $80, I'll try to meet her in the middle, but not exactly at $90. I'll make another counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one, to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(I'll make a counteroffer in the next round)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous offer of $80, but still lower than Alice's current offer of $90. This will show that I'm willing to negotiate and meet her halfway.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 85}"
