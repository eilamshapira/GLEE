"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000, and I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I will also not sell to John immediately, as there's a possibility that Bob might increase his offer in subsequent rounds. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

My counteroffer to Bob is $1,800,000."

This way, I can conclude the negotiation with Bob without having to consider further rounds or switching to John.
