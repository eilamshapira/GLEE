Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, I'll start with a significantly higher offer to Bob to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I can still make a good profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer of $100,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Given that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, and Bob's initial offer is so low (just 10% of John's offer), it suggests Bob might not be a serious buyer or is trying to drastically undervalue the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a new counteroffer of $1,600,000. This is slightly lower than my initial offer but still maintains a strong negotiating position while showing some flexibility."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $250,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While he did increase his offer from $100,000 to $250,000, the increase is not substantial enough to make it worthwhile to continue negotiating, as it's still only 25% of what John is willing to pay. Bob's low offers and small increments suggest he's not likely to reach a price point that would be acceptable to me.

At this point, it's best to end the negotiation and take John's guaranteed offer.
