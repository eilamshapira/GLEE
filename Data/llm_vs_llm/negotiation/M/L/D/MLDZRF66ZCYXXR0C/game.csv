"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6000.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $6000 is too low for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $12500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6000 was too low, but $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500, which is a more reasonable price for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but $7500 is still too low for me. How about $9500?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. $9500 is getting closer to my budget, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000, and if we can't agree on that, I'll have to consider other options.",8000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob. While $8000 is a good step, I cannot go that low. How about we settle at $9000?",9000.0,Alice,7,
