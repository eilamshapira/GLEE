"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, after considering your previous offer, I'm willing to lower my price to $12000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I hope it shows my willingness to negotiate. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for reducing the price to $12000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. I'm still very interested in the product and would like to come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Alice, thank you for continuing to lower the price. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. Your latest offer of $10500 is getting closer to my target price, but I'm still hoping to pay a bit less. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9500. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to meet you at this price if you're willing to accept it.",9500.0,Bob,6,
