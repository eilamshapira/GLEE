I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$9,000 is way too low. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, so I'll try to negotiate with Bob a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway.  $12,000 is my absolute minimum, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product."
