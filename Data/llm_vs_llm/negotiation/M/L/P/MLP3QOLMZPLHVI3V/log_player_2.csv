"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer is $15,000, which is the same price as John's offer, and it's also the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. There's a possibility that Alice might accept a lower price, which would save me money. If negotiations fail, I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be unreasonable. Since $15,000 is the ceiling price, I'll start at 60% of that amount.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has significantly reduced the price from $15,000 to $12,000, which is a substantial $3,000 savings compared to John's price. This is a good offer as it's 20% less than my maximum budget. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might increase the price again or become unwilling to negotiate. Given the significant discount already offered, it's wise to accept this offer.
