Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while still potentially maximizing my profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $13,000 since it's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 (and below what John is offering). Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $15,000, there's no reason to accept anything lower than that.

I'll make a new counteroffer to Bob.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer ($14,500) is still below what John is willing to pay ($15,000), and I have no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further, the rational choice is to sell to John. There's no reason to accept less than what I can definitely get from John.
