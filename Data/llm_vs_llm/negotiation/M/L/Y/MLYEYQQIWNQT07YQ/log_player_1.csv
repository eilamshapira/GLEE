"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $40. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $40
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","$40 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $100. This offer is not even close to being reasonable, so I'll reject it and make a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was very low at $40, I'll lower my initial price somewhat but still maintain a strong position, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to go below my true value.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob has only increased his offer by $10 (from $40 to $50), which is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $100. At this point, Bob's negotiation strategy suggests he might not be willing to reach a fair price. Given that I can sell to John for $100, and Bob's offers are still far below this, I'll take the guaranteed sale to John.
