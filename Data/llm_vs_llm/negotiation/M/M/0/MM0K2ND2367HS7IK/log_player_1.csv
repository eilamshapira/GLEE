Send your offer to Bob.,"Considering the situation, I need to decide what price to offer Bob.

If I offer Bob the product for more than $8,000, he will reject it since the product is only worth $8,000 to him.

If I offer a price below $10,000, I would be making less than what I could get from John.

Since the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, and John is willing to pay that amount, there's no incentive for me to sell to Bob for less.

Therefore, I'll offer Bob the product at $10,000, knowing he'll likely reject it, but that's actually the optimal outcome for me in this scenario.
