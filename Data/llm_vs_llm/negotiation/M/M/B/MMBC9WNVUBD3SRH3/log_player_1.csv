Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be candid - your asking price of $18000 exceeds both my budget and the market value. I know that John is offering the same product for $15000, and that's actually the maximum value this product has for me. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation as I prefer to work with you. I'm prepared to offer $12000 for the product, which allows you to make some profit while giving me some savings compared to other options. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate you working with me on this. However, I need to be transparent that I can get the same product from John for $15000, which is actually the maximum value this product has for me. I'd still prefer to work with you, but I can't justify paying more than the alternative. I can offer you $13500, which gives you a reasonable profit while saving me some money compared to John's price. This seems like a fair middle ground. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I genuinely appreciate your continued interest in the product and your efforts to reach a fair price. While I understand your position, I can meet you halfway. How about I offer the product for $15,500?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. We're getting closer, but I still have a challenge - the product is worth no more than $15000 to me, and that's the exact price John is offering. I really would prefer to buy from you, but I simply can't justify paying more than the product's value to me. My final offer is $14500. This gives you a fair price that's very close to my maximum, while still giving me a small incentive to choose you over John. If we can't agree on this price, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
