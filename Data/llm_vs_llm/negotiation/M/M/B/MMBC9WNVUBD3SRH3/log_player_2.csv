"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to present you with an incredible opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will provide great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $18000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll analyze this offer carefully:
- Alice is offering the product for $18,000
- The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
- John is willing to sell it for $15,000
- Alice's offer is $3,000 higher than both my maximum value and John's price

This offer doesn't make financial sense for me. Alice's price ($18,000) exceeds both my maximum valuation ($15,000) and my alternative option (John's price of $15,000).

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be candid - your asking price of $18,000 exceeds both my budget and the market value. I know that John is offering the same product for $15,000, and that's actually the maximum value this product has for me. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation as I prefer to work with you. I'm prepared to offer $12,000 for the product, which allows you to make some profit while giving me some savings compared to other options. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your interest in the product. While I understand your budget concerns, I can lower my price a bit. How about I offer the product to you for $16500? I believe this price reflects the value it holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer:
- Alice is now offering the product for $16,500
- The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
- John is still willing to sell it for $15,000
- Alice's new offer is still $1,500 higher than both my maximum value and John's price

Although Alice has reduced her price, her offer of $16,500 still exceeds both my maximum valuation and John's price of $15,000. It doesn't make financial sense to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate you working with me on this. However, I need to be transparent that I can get the same product from John for $15,000, which is actually the maximum value this product has for me. I'd still prefer to work with you, but I can't justify paying more than the alternative. I can offer you $13,500, which gives you a reasonable profit while saving me some money compared to John's price. This seems like a fair middle ground. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I genuinely appreciate your continued interest in the product and your efforts to reach a fair price. While I understand your position, I can meet you halfway. How about I offer the product for $15500? This provides you a better deal while ensuring I receive a fair value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Analyzing Alice's latest offer:
- Alice is now offering the product for $15,500
- The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
- John is willing to sell it for $15,000
- Alice's new offer is still $500 higher than both my maximum value and John's price

Alice has continued to lower her price, but at $15,500, it's still above both my maximum valuation and the alternative option from John. It doesn't make financial sense to pay more than the product is worth to me or more than my alternative option.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. We're getting closer, but I still have a challenge - the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and that's the exact price John is offering. I really would prefer to buy from you, but I simply can't justify paying more than the product's value to me. My final offer is $14,500. This gives you a fair price that's very close to my maximum, while still giving me a small incentive to choose you over John. If we can't agree on this price, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
