"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than the product's worth to me (no more than $800,000) and also higher than John's fixed price of $800,000, it would not make sense to accept Alice's offer. John's price is at my maximum value threshold, so it's reasonable to either negotiate with Alice for a better price or accept John's offer.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has lowered her price from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this price is still higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000). Since John's price is still the better option compared to Alice's current offer, I'll reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

However, this price is still higher than John's offer of $800,000. Since John's offer is still better than Alice's current price, and the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, I'll reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating.
