"Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. Based on my market research and the product's inherent value, I'm offering it to you for $1400000. This product is currently worth $1000000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. However, I believe you'll be able to leverage it to generate significantly more value over time. If you're interested, I'd be happy to discuss the details further. If not, I understand - I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase it at $1000000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
