"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. Based on my market research and the product's inherent value, I'm offering it to you for $1400000. This product is currently worth $1000000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. However, I believe you'll be able to leverage it to generate significantly more value over time. If you're interested, I'd be happy to discuss the details further. If not, I understand - I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase it at $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","The product is worth $1,000,000 to me. Alice is offering it for $1,400,000. If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000. Since $1,000,000 is less than $1,400,000, I should reject Alice's offer and buy from John.
