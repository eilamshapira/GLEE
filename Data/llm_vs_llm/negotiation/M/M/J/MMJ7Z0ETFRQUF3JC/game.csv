"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting with a competitive price, considering the product's worth to me.",3000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a more reasonable price point.  Would you consider a significantly lower offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that my initial price may have been steep, but I believe the product's value lies somewhere in between our two proposals. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer, I'd like to make a counteroffer that brings us closer together.",2500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price.  However, $2500000 is still much higher than I'm willing to pay.  To be candid, I'm considering purchasing a similar product elsewhere for a much lower price. If you're serious about selling to me, you'll need to come down significantly.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your honesty about considering other options. I'm still interested in selling the product to you, as I believe it would be a good fit. However, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Considering your latest offer and the fact that I have other interested buyers, I'm willing to make a significant concession. I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and your latest proposal.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for meeting me halfway. I can tell you are serious about selling this product.  While your new offer is tempting, I'm still leaning towards my alternative option. I could be persuaded to close this deal today, but only if the price is right.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. I understand the importance of timing, and I'm willing to make a final concession to close the deal today. Considering your latest offer and the value I place on the product, I'll make a slight adjustment to my previous proposal. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, given the product's worth to me.",1475000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement. This is getting very close to a price I'd be willing to accept, but the gap is still too large. I'm willing to offer you a final price of $1200000.  This is my absolute limit, and I believe it's a fair offer considering my other option.  Take it or leave it.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
