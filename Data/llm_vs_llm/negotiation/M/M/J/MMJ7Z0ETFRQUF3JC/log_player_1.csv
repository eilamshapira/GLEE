"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting with a competitive price, considering the product's worth to me."", ""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a more reasonable price point.  Would you consider a significantly lower offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $800,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and the product's worth to me. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both Bob and me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that my initial price may have been steep, but I believe the product's value lies somewhere in between our two proposals. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer, I'd like to make a counteroffer that brings us closer together."", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price.  However, $2500000 is still much higher than I'm willing to pay.  To be candid, I'm considering purchasing a similar product elsewhere for a much lower price. If you're serious about selling to me, you'll need to come down significantly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Although Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is higher than his previous one, it's still lower than I'm comfortable with, given the product's worth to me. Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, I'll try to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can meet at a price that's at least closer to or exceeds that threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your honesty about considering other options. I'm still interested in selling the product to you, as I believe it would be a good fit. However, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Considering your latest offer and the fact that I have other interested buyers, I'm willing to make a significant concession. I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and your latest proposal."", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for meeting me halfway. I can tell you are serious about selling this product.  While your new offer is tempting, I'm still leaning towards my alternative option. I could be persuaded to close this deal today, but only if the price is right. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is getting closer to a price I'd be willing to accept, but it's still below the threshold of $1,500,000 that John is offering. Since Bob mentions he could be persuaded to close the deal today if the price is right, I'll make another counteroffer to try and meet at a mutually beneficial price, hoping to exceed John's offer or at least match it."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. I understand the importance of timing, and I'm willing to make a final concession to close the deal today. Considering your latest offer and the value I place on the product, I'll make a slight adjustment to my previous proposal. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, given the product's worth to me."", ""product_price"": 1475000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the movement. This is getting very close to a price I'd be willing to accept, but the gap is still too large. I'm willing to offer you a final price of $1200000.  This is my absolute limit, and I believe it's a fair offer considering my other option.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Given that Bob's final offer is $1,200,000, which is below the $1,500,000 that John is willing to pay, it makes more sense to sell the product to John. Bob's offer, although close, does not meet the minimum value I have for the product, especially when a better offer is available from John."
