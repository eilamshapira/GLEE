"Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $5000000. This is a one-time opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional. What do you say?",5000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $5000000 is out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only consider it at a much lower price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $900000 is below my minimum threshold for this product. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure the value reflects the product's worth. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. My counteroffer is $3000000.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $3000000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for what you're getting. What do you think?",3000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $3000000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer, but I need to stay within a reasonable range. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1050000.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, $1050000 is still below what I can accept for this product. Let's try to meet halfway. My counteroffer is $2000000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a common ground here. I'm willing to further lower my price to $2000000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us considering the unique value of the product. What are your thoughts on this?",2000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $2000000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1175000.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
"Thank you, Bob, for your counteroffer. I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle. I will accept your offer of $1175000 for the product. Let's proceed with the transaction.",,Alice,6,AcceptOffer
