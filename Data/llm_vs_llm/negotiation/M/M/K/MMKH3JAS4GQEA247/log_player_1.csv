Send your offer to Bob.,"Given the situation:
1. The product is worth $150 minimum to me
2. The product is worth $120 to Bob
3. I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150
4. Bob can only accept or reject

Since Bob values the product at $120, any offer above $120 will be rejected. Since I have a guaranteed sale to John at $150, there's no reason for me to offer the product below $150 to Bob.
