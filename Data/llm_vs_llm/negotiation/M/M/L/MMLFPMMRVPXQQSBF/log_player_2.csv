"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great opportunity for you to purchase this valuable product. I believe it aligns perfectly with your needs and interests. I'm offering it to you at a price of $10500, which I believe is a fair deal considering its worth and potential value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $10,500 exceeds that value, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $10,000, which is within my budget.
