"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. After careful consideration of market conditions and the product's inherent value, I'm offering it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and potential. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Looking at the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $1,200,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $800,000

Since Alice's offer ($1,200,000) is significantly higher than both the product's worth to me and John's price, the logical choice is to buy from John and save $400,000.
