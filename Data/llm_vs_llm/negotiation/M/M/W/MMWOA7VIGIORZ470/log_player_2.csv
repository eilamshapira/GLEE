"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer to determine if it's favorable for me as Bob. 

Alice's offer is $15,000, which is the maximum value the product has to Alice.
However, the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me.
John is offering to sell me the same product for $10,000.

If I accept Alice's offer, I would pay $15,000 for something worth at most $10,000 to me.
If I buy from John, I would pay $10,000, which matches the maximum value I place on the product.

The logical choice is to buy from John, as this allows me to get the product while saving $5,000 compared to Alice's offer.
