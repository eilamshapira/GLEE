Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price to offer Bob:

1. The product is worth at least $100 to me
2. I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100
3. Since Bob's valuation is unknown, I should offer a price significantly above $100
4. If Bob rejects, I lose nothing since I can still sell to John
5. A reasonable markup would be 50-60% above my minimum value
