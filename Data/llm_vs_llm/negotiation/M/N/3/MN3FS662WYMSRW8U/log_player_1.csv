"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting high, but not *too* high. I want to anchor the negotiation near Bob's maximum willingness to pay ($1,500,000), but I also want to make it seem like I'm willing to negotiate. Offering $1,500,000 outright might scare him off immediately. $1,400,000 leaves room for him to feel like he's ""winning"" if he negotiates it down a bit. I also need to consider the number of rounds, so starting at 1.4 million is a good place to test the waters without burning all my time in the first couple of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is too low. I value the product at $800,000. While it's a decent profit, I know Bob values it at $1,500,000, so there's still significant room to negotiate a better price. I'm not going to jump at the first counteroffer, especially with 9 rounds left. Selling to John at this point would be foolish."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm reducing my offer by $100,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and move toward a mutually agreeable price. Dropping it any more significantly at this stage might signal desperation, which I want to avoid. I still want to aim for a price closer to Bob's valuation, so a $100,000 reduction feels like a reasonable step. I'm betting that the fact that I came down from my original price will encourage Bob to raise his offer as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob increased his offer by $100,000, which is good! It means he's engaged in the negotiation and willing to move. However, $1,100,000 is still too low given that he values the product at $1,500,000. I still have a good amount of time left, and selling to John for $800,000 is not tempting when Bob is already offering $1,100,000. I am going to reject and continue to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

Okay, Bob's moving in the right direction. I'll come down again, but this time only by $50,000. This signals that I'm approaching my bottom line, even if I'm not *actually* there yet. The smaller increment should encourage Bob to increase his offer by a larger amount next time. I'm still aiming for a price well above my minimum of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

$1,200,000 is a good offer, but I'm still going to reject it. Bob increased his offer by $100,000, which is less than my previous reduction of $50,000. This suggests he might be trying to slow down the negotiation, but I have enough rounds to push a bit more. Selling to John is still not an option at this price. I am going to make one last try to squeeze out a bit more value. I have to be careful as it's round 6, but I feel like I can still push a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1230000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a very small reduction this time, only $20,000. This is a tactic to signal that I'm very close to my absolute lowest price. I want Bob to feel like he's getting a deal, but I also want to maximize my profit. This small reduction communicates that I'm nearly at my limit and that he should consider accepting a price very close to my offer. This is a bit of a gamble, but I think it's worth it to potentially squeeze out a bit more profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,210,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,210,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Okay, this is it. Bob only increased his offer by $10,000. We're clearly very close to the point where further negotiation will yield minimal gains, and I'm running out of rounds. While I'd ideally like a bit more, $1,210,000 is a very good price, well above my minimum. It's time to accept the offer and secure the profit rather than risk losing the deal entirely in the last two rounds. Selling to John is not an option at all."
