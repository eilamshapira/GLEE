"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you have a certain budget in mind, but I'm afraid $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your counteroffer. How about we settle at $80? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
