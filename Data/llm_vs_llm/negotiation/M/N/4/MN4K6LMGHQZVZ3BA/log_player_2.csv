"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. After careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $11000. This price represents a good opportunity for both of us - you'll receive a product worth $12000 to you, giving you $1000 in value, while I'll be able to earn more than my minimum acceptable amount. This creates a win-win situation where we both benefit from the transaction. Would you like to proceed with this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
