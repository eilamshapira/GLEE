"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1200000. It's a significant investment with a high potential return, and I believe it aligns well with your company's goals.  This price is below market value, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000
2. The product is worth $1,000,000 to me (my maximum value)
3. John is offering the same product for $1,000,000
4. My goal is to save money while getting the product

Since:
- Alice's offer ($1,200,000) is above my maximum value ($1,000,000)
- John's offer ($1,000,000) equals my maximum value
- John's offer is $200,000 less than Alice's offer

The logical choice is to buy from John.
