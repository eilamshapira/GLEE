Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $12,000 to Bob
2. My minimum acceptable price is $10,000
3. If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed $10,000 from John
4. Bob will only accept if the price is at or below $12,000
5. To maximize my profit, I should price it close to Bob's maximum value while ensuring it's still attractive enough for him to accept

I'll offer slightly below Bob's maximum value to make it appealing enough to accept while maximizing my profit:

{""product_price"": 11500}"
