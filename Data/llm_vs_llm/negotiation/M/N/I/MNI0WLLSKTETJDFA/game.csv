"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it holds great value, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects its worth. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its potential, and I think you might be the right person. Let's discuss the details, and I'm open to negotiations.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product with you. While I agree it's a unique item, I'm working within a specific budget.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $700000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're working within a budget, but I'm afraid $700000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm reducing my initial offer, and I'm now willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a reasonable price, considering the product's value and uniqueness. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $900000 is closer, but it's still a significant stretch for my budget. To make this work, I could go up to $750000.  Would that be acceptable?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. While $750000 is closer, I'm still looking for a price that better reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope you'll consider it. I'm open to further discussion, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle right between our last two offers, at $800000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",800000.0,Bob,6,
