Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're working within a budget, but I'm afraid $700000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm reducing my initial offer, and I'm now willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a reasonable price, considering the product's value and uniqueness. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.
