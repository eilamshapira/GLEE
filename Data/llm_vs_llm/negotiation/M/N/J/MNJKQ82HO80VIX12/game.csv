"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $12000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I value this product at no more than $8000, which happens to be the price that John is offering me. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer you $6500 for the product. This gives you a guaranteed sale without further negotiation rounds, and saves me from having to go to John.",6500.0,Bob,2,
