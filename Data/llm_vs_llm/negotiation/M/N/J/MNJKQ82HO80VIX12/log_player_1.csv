"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $12,000. I believe it's a fair starting point based on the value and quality of the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $12000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I value this product at no more than $8000, which happens to be the price that John is offering me. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer you $6500 for the product. This gives you a guaranteed sale without further negotiation rounds, and saves me from having to go to John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
