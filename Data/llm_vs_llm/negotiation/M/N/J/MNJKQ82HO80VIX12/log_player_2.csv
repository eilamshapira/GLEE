"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $12000. I believe it's a fair starting point based on the value and quality of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's starting offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000 and also higher than John's guaranteed price of $8,000. There's no reason to accept this offer.

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, as there's potential to negotiate a better price than John's $8,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $12,000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I value this product at no more than $8,000, which happens to be the price that John is offering me. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer you $6,500 for the product. This gives you a guaranteed sale without further negotiation rounds, and saves me from having to go to John."", ""product_price"": 6500}"
