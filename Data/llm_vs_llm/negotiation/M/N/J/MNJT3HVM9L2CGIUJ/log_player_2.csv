"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2500000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. It's highly unlikely the product is worth that much to you."
