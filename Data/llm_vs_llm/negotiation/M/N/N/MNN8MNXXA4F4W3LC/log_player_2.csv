"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","The product is worth no more than $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $150, which is more expensive than my maximum value. John is offering the same product for $120, which is exactly my maximum value.

Since Alice's offer is more expensive than my maximum value and also more expensive than John's alternative offer, I should not accept Alice's offer.
