"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $25000. What do you say?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $4000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering my needs.",4000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $4000 is significantly below my expectations for this product. I'm willing to lower my price to $20000, considering your budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",20000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $20000 might still be a stretch. How about we meet halfway? I'm willing to sell the product for $15000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $15000 is still above my budget. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $5500. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",5500.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. However, $5500 is still not within the range I'm willing to accept for this product. I'm willing to come down further to $12000, which is a substantial discount from my initial price. Let's see if we can close the deal at this amount.",12000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're still a bit apart on the price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $11000. This is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to lower the price. However, $11000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $6500. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, but I'm also considering other options that are closer to my budget. I hope we can meet at this price.",6500.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $6500 is still too low for me to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, which is just above my minimum acceptable price. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",10500.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting close but still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $10200, which is my absolute lowest price. This is a final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to consider other buyers. Let me know if this works for you.",10200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but $10200 is still a bit above what I'm willing to pay. Considering your statement that this is your absolute lowest price, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer $7500, which is the highest I'm comfortable going. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options that are within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,8,
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase the product for $10000. Given the circumstances, I will sell the product to John. Thank you for your interest.",,Alice,8,SellToJhon
