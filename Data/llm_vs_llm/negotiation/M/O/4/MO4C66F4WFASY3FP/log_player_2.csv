"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I know you're interested in the product. Its value to you is clear. I'm offering it to you for $17000. This reflects the significant value it holds for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $17,000 exceeds that value, it would not be in my best interest to accept her offer. Given that I have the option to buy the product from John for $15,000, which is within my budget and matches the maximum value I place on the product, I would choose to reject Alice's offer and instead buy from John.
