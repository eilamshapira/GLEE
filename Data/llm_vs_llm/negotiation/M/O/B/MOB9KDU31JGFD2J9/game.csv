"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value you're seeing, but given my budget constraints, I'm prepared to purchase the product at $1000000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value to both of us. Looking forward to your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the offer you've presented. While I acknowledge your budget limitations, $1000000 is significantly below the value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. This price still reflects the potential of this product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's continue this conversation.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
"Alice, I appreciate your revised offer. While I see the value you're pointing out, I'm still mindful of my budget constraints. I can stretch a bit, but $1300000 is still above what I can commit to. How about we settle at $1100000? I believe this is a fair compromise, and it fits within the range I'm comfortable with. Looking forward to your response.",1100000.0,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your perspective and understand the value you place on the product. I can see we're not too far apart – while your revised offer of $1300000 is above my comfort zone, I’m prepared to move slightly upward from my previous offer. My best offer now is $1150000. I believe this strikes a fair balance and reflects the mutual benefits of reaching an agreement. Looking forward to your thoughts.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, your offer of $1150000 is getting closer, but still a bit short of what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway,  and offer the product for $1250000. This price takes into account the value of the product and your budget constraints. Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
