"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me and Alice is offering it for $15,000, I should reject the offer and consider my alternatives. Buying from John for $8,000 is a guaranteed option, but I have 10 rounds to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's initial offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I want to get the best possible price, but I also need to consider Alice's perspective. Since the product is worth $15,000 to her, offering a ridiculously low price might end the negotiation quickly. I'll start with a significantly lower offer, but one that still gives Alice some potential profit.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has lowered her price, but it's still significantly above my maximum value. Buying from John is still the better option at $8,000. I will reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice came down a significant amount, which suggests she is willing to negotiate further. I don't want to scare her off by going too low again, but I need to keep the pressure on. I will raise my offer slightly, still aiming for a price well below John's offer.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice is continuing to come down in price, but $10,000 is still too high for me. John's offer of $8,000 remains the better option. I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice is getting closer to my target price, I'll make a more aggressive offer this round. I'll aim for something just under John's offer to signal I'm serious about closing the deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice is now only slightly above John's price. Given that I value the product at no more than $8,000, and John is offering it for that exact price, I'm now at the point where further negotiation might not be worth the risk of losing the deal. However, I will send a counteroffer one more time.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make one final attempt to get the price down to $8,000. If Alice rejects this, I'll just buy from John.
