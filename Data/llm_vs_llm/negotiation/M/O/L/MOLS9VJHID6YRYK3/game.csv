"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit higher than I was hoping for. How about I offer you $70 instead?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob, but $70 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can do $110, which is a great deal considering the product's value. Let me know if that works for you!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $110 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see we're getting closer, Bob! $85 is a good offer, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about we meet at $105? It's a great price for both of us, considering the product's value to you is higher than that. Let me know if that works!",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"We're definitely getting closer, Alice! I appreciate your effort to meet me in the middle. However, $105 is still a bit high. Would you consider selling the product for $90?",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close now, Bob! $90 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit short of where I'd like to be. How about we meet at $100? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think we can both walk away happy with that deal.",100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"We're almost there, Alice! I understand where you're coming from, but I think $100 is still a bit high. Would you be willing to sell the product for $95? I think that would be a fair compromise for both of us.",95.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we're extremely close now, Bob! $95 is a very good offer, but I'm still just a hair's breadth away from where I'd like to be. How about we meet at $97.50? I think that's a more than fair compromise, and I'm willing to make that final concession to close the deal.",97.5,Alice,9,
