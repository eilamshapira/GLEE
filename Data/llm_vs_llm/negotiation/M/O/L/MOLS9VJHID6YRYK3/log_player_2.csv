"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Let's see if Alice can lower her price. The product is worth no more than $100 to me, so I won't accept Alice's offer of $120. I also don't want to buy it from John for $100 yet, as I might be able to get a better deal from Alice.)

Counteroffer: $70
# Your message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit higher than I was hoping for. How about I offer you $70 instead?"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob, but $70 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can do $110, which is a great deal considering the product's value. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

(Alice's new offer of $110 is still higher than the $100 value I place on the product. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.)

Counteroffer: $85

# Your message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $110 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85?"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see we're getting closer, Bob! $85 is a good offer, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about we meet at $105? It's a great price for both of us, considering the product's value to you is higher than that. Let me know if that works! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

(Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still higher than what John is offering. I'll make another counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal.)

Counteroffer: $90

# Your message: We're definitely getting closer, Alice! I appreciate your effort to meet me in the middle. However, $105 is still a bit high. Would you consider selling the product for $90?"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're really close now, Bob! $90 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit short of where I'd like to be. How about we meet at $100? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think we can both walk away happy with that deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

(Alice's offer is now equal to John's, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll make another counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal.)

Counteroffer: $95

# Your message: We're almost there, Alice! I understand where you're coming from, but I think $100 is still a bit high. Would you be willing to sell the product for $95? I think that would be a fair compromise for both of us."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're extremely close now, Bob! $95 is a very good offer, but I'm still just a hair's breadth away from where I'd like to be. How about we meet at $97.50? I think that's a more than fair compromise, and I'm willing to make that final concession to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

(Alice's offer of $97.50 is lower than John's offer of $100 and lower than my maximum willingness to pay. I'll accept Alice's offer.)
