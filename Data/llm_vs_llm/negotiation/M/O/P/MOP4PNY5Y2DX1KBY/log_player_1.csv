"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting high. I know Bob values the product at $80, and it's worth at least $100 to me. I'm aiming to capture as much of the potential surplus as possible. By starting at $140, I'm testing the waters and seeing how willing Bob is to negotiate. I need to leave myself room to come down in price while still making a worthwhile profit. I can always fallback to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $70 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm not willing to take such a significant loss. Selling to John for $100 is tempting, but I still have 8 rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially extract a higher price. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and prepare a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob came in low at $70. I'm adjusting my strategy to signal I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a good profit. I'm reducing my asking price from $140 to $125. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $100 and above his valuation of $80. This leaves room for further negotiation if needed, while I am still getting a better price than selling to John now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is barely budging. His offer of $75 is still well below my $100 minimum. I'm now considering selling to John, but I will reject Bob's offer one more time and see if I can get him closer to my minimum acceptable price with a more enticing counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm dropping the price more significantly this time. I want to signal I'm serious about making a deal, but I still need to make it worth my while. $110 is only slightly above my break-even point ($100), but it's a move that should entice Bob to also move more substantially on his side. It is also high enough that he might find it a fair price. It also shows good faith in my willingness to negotiate and move towards a mutually beneficial outcome. If he rejects this, I'm selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached his maximum valuation of $80. It is clear that he will not offer more than that. Since my minimum acceptable price is $100, I would be taking a loss by accepting his offer. I still have the option to sell to John for $100, which is a better outcome for me. Therefore, I will choose to sell to John."
