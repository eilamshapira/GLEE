"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your assessment of the product's value, but $1700000 is significantly higher than what I can justify for my needs. I know the product is worth $1500000 to you, and I have an alternative option to purchase it from another seller for $1000000. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to offer $1100000, which gives you a $100000 profit above your valuation while still providing me with some value. This seems like a fair middle ground that benefits us both.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
