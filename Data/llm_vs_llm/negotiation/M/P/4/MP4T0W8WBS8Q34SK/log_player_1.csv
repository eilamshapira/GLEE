Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your assessment of the product's value, but $1700000 is significantly higher than what I can justify for my needs. I know the product is worth $1500000 to you, and I have an alternative option to purchase it from another seller for $1000000. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to offer $1100000, which gives you a $100000 profit above your valuation while still providing me with some value. This seems like a fair middle ground that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
