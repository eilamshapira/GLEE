"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, based on the value of the product and the market, I'm offering it to you for $1700000. I believe this price reflects the quality and potential of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $1,700,000, which is significantly above my maximum valuation of $1,000,000. Even though the product might have good quality, paying more than what it's worth to me wouldn't be a good financial decision.

John is offering the same product for $1,000,000, which matches exactly my maximum valuation. This means I would get no consumer surplus from that purchase.

Since Alice's initial offer is too high, and I can always fall back on John's offer, I should reject and make a counteroffer to Alice to see if we can reach a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your assessment of the product's value, but $1,700,000 is significantly higher than what I can justify for my needs. I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I have an alternative option to purchase it from another seller for $1,000,000. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000, which gives you a $100,000 profit above your valuation while still providing me with some value. This seems like a fair middle ground that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
