Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be very valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price, considering I can get a similar product from another seller for the same price you're offering. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer in the next round. While $900,000 is above my minimum threshold, there's still room for negotiation given the product's value and Bob's apparent interest."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest and counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your perspective, my product offers unique qualities that differentiate it from similar products in the market. Given these advantages, I'm willing to adjust my initial price to $1,050,000, which I believe represents a fair value for both parties."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous counteroffer and for your revised price. I appreciate the unique qualities of your product, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $975000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I accept Bob's offer of $975,000. This is a good price that represents a fair compromise between our positions, and it's significantly better than my fallback option with John. The negotiation has been productive, and this price provides a good profit margin above my minimum threshold."
