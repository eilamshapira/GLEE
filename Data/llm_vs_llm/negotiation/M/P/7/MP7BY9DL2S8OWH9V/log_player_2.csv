"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $20,000 is far too high, considering my maximum value for the product is $8,000 and I have the option to buy from John at that price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round that's more reasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 5000}

I'll make a counteroffer of $5,000. This is significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer and John's price, which gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's $8,000 price. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate up to a price closer to $8,000, which is my maximum value and my alternative option with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $18,000 is still much higher than my maximum value of $8,000 and John's price. While she did reduce the price from her initial offer, it's still not close to an acceptable range. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. There's no reason to accept a price that's more than twice what I can pay to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 6000}

I'll increase my offer to $6,000. This shows some movement from my previous offer of $5,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate, while still keeping well below John's price of $8,000. This gives me room to potentially negotiate further if needed, while trying to secure a better deal than my alternative option with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still far above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000). While Alice is slowly decreasing her price, the rate of decrease suggests we may not reach an acceptable price within the remaining rounds. However, I'll make one more attempt at negotiation before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 7000}

I'll increase my offer to $7,000. This is my best offer, just $1,000 below John's price, showing I'm serious about making a deal. If Alice doesn't accept this or come back with a counter close to $8,000, I'll likely need to go with John's offer. This price gives Alice one last chance to make a deal while still giving me some savings compared to my alternative option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's clear that Alice's negotiation strategy isn't aligning with my maximum value of $8,000. Even after several rounds of negotiation, her latest offer of $15,000 is still nearly double my maximum value, and she's only making small decrements in price. Given that:

1. We've already gone through 7 rounds
2. Alice's offers remain significantly above my maximum value
3. The rate of price decrease suggests we won't reach $8,000 in the remaining rounds
4. I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $8,000

It's most rational to end the negotiation with Alice and take John's offer at $8,000. This ensures I get the product at my maximum acceptable price without risking further rounds of unsuccessful negotiation."
