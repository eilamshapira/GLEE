"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $80? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit high, but I was thinking more along the lines of meeting in the middle. How about we split the difference between my initial offer and your counteroffer?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $85, let's try to find a middle ground here.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price. I'm also willing to be flexible, so I'll meet you halfway between my previous offer of $100 and your new offer of $85. Let's try $92.50.",92.5,Alice,5,
