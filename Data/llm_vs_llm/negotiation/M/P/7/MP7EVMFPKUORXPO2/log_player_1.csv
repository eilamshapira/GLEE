"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair price."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $80? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since the product is worth no less than $80 to me, and Bob's offer is exactly $80, I could consider accepting it. However, I also have the option to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob or sell it to John for the same price. Given that I have 9 more rounds to negotiate and the goal is to earn as much money as I can, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit high, but I was thinking more along the lines of meeting in the middle. How about we split the difference between my initial offer and your counteroffer?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $85, let's try to find a middle ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer of $85 is still lower than I had hoped, but it's getting closer to a price that I might be willing to accept. Since I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, I'll try to see if I can get Bob to meet me at a higher price. I'll reject his offer of $85 and make a new counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one, to show that I'm willing to compromise.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price.
