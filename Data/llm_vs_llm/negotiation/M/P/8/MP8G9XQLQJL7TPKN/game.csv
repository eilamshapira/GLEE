"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the $5 savings compared to John's price, I think we can find a price that works better for both of us. The product is worth $100 to me, but I'd like to pay $85 for it. This gives you a $5 profit over your cost and saves me $15 compared to buying from John. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's still a significant savings for you compared to John's price.",90.0,Alice,3,
