Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the $5 savings compared to John's price, I think we can find a price that works better for both of us. The product is worth $100 to me, but I'd like to pay $85 for it. This gives you a $5 profit over your cost and saves me $15 compared to buying from John. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's still a significant savings for you compared to John's price."", ""product_price"": 90}"
