"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'll analyze the situation:

- The product is worth up to $100 to me (Bob)
- Alice's product costs her $80
- Alice is offering the product for $95
- I can buy from John for $100 as a backup option

Alice's current offer of $95 is $5 less than John's price of $100, but there's room for negotiation since Alice's cost is $80. I should reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer to try to save more money.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the $5 savings compared to John's price, I think we can find a price that works better for both of us. The product is worth $100 to me, but I'd like to pay $85 for it. This gives you a $5 profit over your cost and saves me $15 compared to buying from John. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's still a significant savings for you compared to John's price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'll analyze Alice's new offer:

- Alice has lowered her price from $95 to $90
- This is $10 less than John's price of $100
- Alice's cost is $80, so she's making a $10 profit
- There might still be room to negotiate, but $90 is a reasonable price

Since Alice has already come down from her initial offer and is now offering a $10 savings compared to John's price, this is a good deal. While I could try to negotiate further, I risk Alice potentially raising her price or ending negotiations. The current offer of $90 represents a fair compromise.
