"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,499,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,499,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Alice's offer: $1,499,999
2. John's price: $1,200,000
3. My maximum value: $1,200,000

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to me ($1,200,000), so accepting her offer would result in a loss. 

John's price is exactly equal to my maximum value ($1,200,000), which means I would break even by buying from him.

The best decision is to reject Alice's expensive offer and buy from John instead.
