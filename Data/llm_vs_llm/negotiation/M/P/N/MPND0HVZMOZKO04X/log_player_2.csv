"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is offering the product for the same price as John. Since your goal is to save money and there's no difference in price, it makes sense to buy from John."
