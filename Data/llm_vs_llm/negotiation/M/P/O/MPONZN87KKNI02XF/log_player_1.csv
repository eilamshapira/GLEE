"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $150 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $50.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, as his offer of $50 is significantly lower than the product's value to me. I believe I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $50 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and lower the price from my initial offer. Let's meet somewhere in the middle."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice.  $120 is still higher than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, as his offer of $85 is still lower than what I'm willing to accept. Since John is willing to buy the product for $100, I'll try to get a better offer from Bob or at least match John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make another compromise and lower the price slightly. Let's see if we can meet closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to make a deal here, but I have a firm budget. I can go up to $70, but that's the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with another option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's maximum offer is $70, which is significantly lower than John's offer of $100, I will choose to sell the product to John. Further negotiations with Bob are unlikely to result in a better offer, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
