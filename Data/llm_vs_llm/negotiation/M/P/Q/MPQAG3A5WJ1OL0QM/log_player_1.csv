Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1500000 is well above my budget. I'm aware that I can get this product elsewhere for $1000000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable price. Would you consider accepting $800000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
