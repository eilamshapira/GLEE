"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe might interest you. Iâ€™m offering it for $1500000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,000,000 and also higher than John's price. Since I can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $1,500,000. I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price before potentially going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,500,000 is well above my budget. I'm aware that I can get this product elsewhere for $1,000,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable price. Would you consider accepting $800,000 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
