"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is quite high for this product. I know the market value well, and I can actually get it from another seller for $150. However, I'd like to work with you. Would you consider selling it for $130? This would give us both a fair deal.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I've considered your offer and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $170? This price reflects the product's value and our mutual interest in making a deal.",170.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I can get this product from another seller for $150. I'd like to give you the business, so I can go up to $140. This would be a win-win situation as you'd make a sale, and I'd save a bit compared to my other option.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I've considered your last offer and I'm willing to lower my price again. Let's settle for $155? This price is quite close to your other option, and it would allow us to close the deal promptly.",155.0,Alice,5,
