Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is quite high for this product. I know the market value well, and I can actually get it from another seller for $150. However, I'd like to work with you. Would you consider selling it for $130? This would give us both a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

# Message to Bob:
Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in working with me. However, $130 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to lower my price to $170. This is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I can get this product from another seller for $150. I'd like to give you the business, so I can go up to $140. This would be a win-win situation as you'd make a sale, and I'd save a bit compared to my other option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

# Message to Bob:
Hi Bob, I understand your perspective and I will come down from the last price. Let's meet in the middle at $155. This way, you're still saving a bit, and I'm making a reasonable profit. What do you say?"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I've considered your last offer and I'm willing to lower my price again. Let's settle for $155? This price is quite close to your other option, and it would allow us to close the deal promptly."", ""product_price"": 155}"
