"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $200. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering the product for $200
2. The product is worth no more than $150 to me
3. John is willing to sell it for $150
4. I can try to negotiate with Alice to get a better price
5. Since $200 is above my maximum value ($150), and it's higher than John's price, I should reject this offer and try to negotiate

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but leaves room for negotiation:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is quite high for this product. I know the market value well, and I can actually get it from another seller for $150. However, I'd like to work with you. Would you consider selling it for $130? This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I've considered your offer and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $170? This price reflects the product's value and our mutual interest in making a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice has reduced her price from $200 to $170
2. However, $170 is still above both:
   - My maximum value ($150)
   - John's offering price ($150)
3. There's no reason to accept $170 when I can get it for $150 from John
4. We still have several rounds left to negotiate
5. Since Alice has shown willingness to reduce the price, I should try one more counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $30 from her initial offer, I'll also adjust my offer upward to show good faith in negotiating:

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I can get this product from another seller for $150. I'd like to give you the business, so I can go up to $140. This would be a win-win situation as you'd make a sale, and I'd save a bit compared to my other option."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I've considered your last offer and I'm willing to lower my price again. Let's settle for $155? This price is quite close to your other option, and it would allow us to close the deal promptly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $200 to $155
2. However, this is still $5 more than John's price ($150)
3. More importantly, it's still above my maximum value ($150)
4. There's no logical reason to pay $155 when I can get it for $150 from John
5. Since Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate down close to $150, she might go lower, but we're also running out of rounds
6. At this point, it's safer to go with John's guaranteed $150 price rather than risk more rounds of negotiation
