Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make an initial offer that leaves room for negotiation while starting relatively high.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer is exactly the same as John's offer ($120), and this price is my minimum acceptable price, there's no advantage in continuing the negotiation or switching to John. I'll accept Bob's offer.
