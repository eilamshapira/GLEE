I'll try to negotiate with Alice first and see if I can get a better price.  It's worth trying to save some money."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  I'm willing to pay up to $100, but I'd like to see if I can get a better deal."
