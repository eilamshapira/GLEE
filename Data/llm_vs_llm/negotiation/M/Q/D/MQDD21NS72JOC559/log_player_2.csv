"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for $8000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she's selling the product for $8,000. Let me analyze this situation:

- The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
- Alice's offer is exactly $8,000
- John is also willing to sell the product for $8,000

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($8,000), and this price is at the maximum value the product is worth to me, I am indifferent between the two sellers from a purely financial perspective.

Given that Alice has made the effort to reach out with an offer that matches my maximum value, I might as well accept her offer.
