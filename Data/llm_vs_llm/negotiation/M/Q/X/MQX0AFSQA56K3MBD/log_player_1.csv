"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $1,500,000 to me and only $1,000,000 to Bob, I'll start with a high offer but leave some room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 1,800,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and even below the product's value to him ($1,000,000), I will reject this offer. However, since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, and Bob's initial offer is so low, it makes more sense to sell to John rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to reach my minimum price.
