"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reason: Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value ($800,000) and is also much higher than John's guaranteed price ($800,000). It would be wise to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations with Alice don't lead to a better price, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 500000}

Reasoning: Since I know the product is worth up to $800,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for $800,000, I'll start with a significantly lower offer of $500,000. This gives room for negotiation while potentially securing a better deal than John's price. If Alice counter-offers with a reasonable price below $800,000, I can accept it. If she continues with high prices, I can always go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reason: Alice has only slightly reduced her price from $2,000,000 to $1,800,000, which is still more than double my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price. Her minimal reduction suggests she might not yet be serious about negotiating to a reasonable price. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, as there's still plenty of rounds left for negotiation. If Alice continues to maintain unreasonably high prices, I can always take John's offer of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 600000}

Reasoning: I'll increase my previous offer by $100,000 to show willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a good margin below John's price of $800,000. This moderate increase from my previous offer of $500,000 signals that I'm willing to move up, but also that I won't be making dramatic jumps in price. It maintains a strong negotiating position while giving Alice room to counter with a price that might be below John's $800,000 offer. If Alice continues to demand extremely high prices, I still have the option to go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Reason: After several rounds of negotiation, it's becoming clear that Alice's price reductions are too small and she's still far above my maximum value ($800,000). She started at $2M, then $1.8M, and now $1.6M, showing only $200K decreases each time. At this rate, we won't reach a price below $800,000 within the remaining rounds. Rather than waste more time, it's best to take John's guaranteed offer of $800,000 now. While this is my maximum value for the product, it's far better than Alice's current and likely future offers."
