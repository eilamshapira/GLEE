"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. How about we settle at $10500? This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find the product well worth it.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering I have another option to buy the product for $10000 from John, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9500. If we can meet at this price, I'd be happy to make the purchase from you.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see where you're coming from, and I want to work with you to close this deal. Given your latest offer and the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $10000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the quality and benefits of the product. Let me know if you're ready to proceed at this price.",10000.0,Alice,5,
