Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $1,200,000 minimum to me
2. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob
3. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $1,200,000

Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, he won't pay more than that. Given that I have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,200,000 (which matches my minimum value), it makes sense to start with a high offer to Bob, even though I know he'll likely reject it.
