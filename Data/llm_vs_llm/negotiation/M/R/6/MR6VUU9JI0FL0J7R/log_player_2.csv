"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Here's my decision-making process:

*   **My Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to me.
*   **Alice's Offer:** $1,300,000. This is *more* than my maximum value.
*   **John's Offer:** $1,000,000. This is *exactly* my maximum value.

Since Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to me, I should reject it.
Since I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within my limit, I should not enter into another round of negotiation with Alice.

Therefore, my decision is:

```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```"
