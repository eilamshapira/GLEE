"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product and I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start by making a high offer. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially settle on a higher price than if I started with a lower offer.

{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is higher than the minimum value of $800,000 that I'm willing to accept, and it's a significant amount, I'm inclined to consider it seriously. However, I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate, and Bob has already shown willingness to pay a high price. 

Given that Bob's first counteroffer is already at $1,100,000, it suggests that he values the product highly. I might be able to get an even better offer from him by continuing the negotiation.

Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to see if I can get an even higher price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $1,100,000, and I'm looking to maximize my earnings, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than his previous offer, but not so high that it would be unreasonable or discourage him from continuing the negotiation.

My counteroffer will be $1,200,000. This amount is high enough to reflect the product's value and my desire to get the best possible price, but still within a range that could be considered reasonable for someone who has already offered $1,100,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's new offer of $1,050,000 is lower than his previous offer of $1,100,000. This could indicate that he's trying to negotiate a better price, but it might also suggest that he's starting to reach his budget limit or losing interest.

Given that $1,050,000 is still a significant amount and higher than the minimum value I'm willing to accept ($800,000), it's a decent offer. However, I've already invested time in the negotiation, and I believe the product is worth more to Bob, as evidenced by his initial higher offer.

I'll reject Bob's current offer and proceed to the next round, aiming to find a middle ground or encourage him to increase his offer again. My goal is to get closer to or exceed the $1,100,000 he previously offered.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's last offer was $1,050,000, and he had previously offered $1,100,000, I'll try to meet him halfway between my last offer ($1,200,000) and his last offer ($1,050,000). This approach shows that I'm willing to negotiate and compromise.

My counteroffer will be $1,075,000. This price is slightly above the midpoint between $1,050,000 and $1,100,000, indicating that I'm flexible but still aiming for a higher price.

{""product_price"": 1075000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's new offer of $1,000,000 is a significant decrease from his previous offers, indicating that he might be reaching his limit or losing interest in the product. This offer is still higher than the minimum value I'm willing to accept ($800,000), but it's lower than what I was hoping to achieve, especially considering his earlier offer of $1,100,000.

At this point, I have to weigh the potential of continuing the negotiation against the risk of Bob walking away or not being able to offer a better price. Since we are halfway through the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offers have been decreasing, I need to consider the possibility that his next offer might not be better, or that he might decide not to purchase the product at all.

Given these considerations, accepting $1,000,000 starts to look like a more secure option, especially since it's still a good price and better than selling to John for $800,000. However, I'm not ready to give up on the potential for a better offer just yet.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's last offer was $1,000,000, and I'm trying to maximize the price while considering his decreasing offers, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly above his last offer but not excessively high. This approach aims to encourage him to meet me at a higher price without discouraging him from continuing the negotiation.

My counteroffer will be $1,025,000. This price is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's decreased offer while still pushing for a better deal. It's also closer to his previous higher offers, suggesting that I'm willing to work with him to find a mutually beneficial price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's new offer of $950,000 is another decrease, indicating that he's continuing to push for a lower price. At this point, I have to consider whether continuing the negotiation is likely to yield a significantly better offer. With only two rounds left, the potential for a major increase in Bob's offer seems limited, given the trend of his decreasing bids.

Accepting $950,000 is still an option, as it's above the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($800,000). However, I need to weigh this against the possibility of getting a slightly better deal in the next round or the security of selling to John for $800,000, which is a guaranteed sale.

Given that Bob's offers have been consistently decreasing and we're nearing the end of the negotiation, I'm inclined to think that his next offer might not be substantially better, if he even makes one. Therefore, I'll consider accepting his current offer, as it represents a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price.
