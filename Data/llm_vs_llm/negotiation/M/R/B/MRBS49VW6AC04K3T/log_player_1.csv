Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider the situation carefully. 

Since the product is worth at least $150 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay exactly $150, there's no reason for me to sell to Bob for less than $150.

However, Bob values the product at only $100, which means he would reject any offer above $100. Since my guaranteed alternative (selling to John) gives me $150, it makes more sense to make an offer that Bob will reject so I can sell to John instead.
