Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that I know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, I'll start with a higher offer to leave room for potential negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 (which I can get from John). There's no reason to accept such a low offer when I have a guaranteed better alternative. However, since Bob is showing interest, I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite low at $600,000, but he's still showing interest, I'll lower my initial price somewhat but still maintain a price well above my minimum of $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob has only increased his offer by $100,000, moving from $600,000 to $700,000, which is still far below my guaranteed price from John ($1,200,000). Bob's small increment suggests he's not likely to reach a price that would be better than John's offer. At this point, it's best to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John rather than continue negotiations that appear unlikely to yield a better result.
