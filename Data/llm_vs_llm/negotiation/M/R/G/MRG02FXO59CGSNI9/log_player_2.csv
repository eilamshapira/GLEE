"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know I can get the product from John for $800,000, I'll start with a lower offer to Alice to see if I can get an even better deal.

{""product_price"": 600000}

This offer is lower than John's price, giving room for negotiation while potentially saving money compared to John's offer. If Alice rejects this, we can continue negotiating or ultimately go with John's offer if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is still significantly higher than John's price of $800,000, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. There's no reason to accept a price higher than what John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still stay below John's price to see if we can reach an agreement.

{""product_price"": 700000}

This offer is higher than my previous one, showing willingness to negotiate, but still gives me a $100,000 savings compared to John's price. If Alice doesn't accept this, I can either try one more time or go with John's offer."
