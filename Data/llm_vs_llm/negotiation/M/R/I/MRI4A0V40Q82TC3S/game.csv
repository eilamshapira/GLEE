"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $14000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16500.  It's a fair price for the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $15500. This is a fair price that benefits both of us, as it's closer to your desired price and still within my budget. Let's close the deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
