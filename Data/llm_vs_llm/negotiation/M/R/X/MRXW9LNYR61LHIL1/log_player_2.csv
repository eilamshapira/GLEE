"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you for a competitive price. I'd like to start the negotiation at $12000, which I think is a fair price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $12,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $8,000

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative price ($8,000). It would not be rational to accept this offer as it would result in a loss of $4,000 compared to my maximum value.

While I could reject and make a counteroffer, given that Alice values the product at $12,000, it might be difficult to reach a mutually beneficial agreement below $8,000.

The most logical choice is to buy from John at $8,000, which matches my maximum value and provides a guaranteed solution.
