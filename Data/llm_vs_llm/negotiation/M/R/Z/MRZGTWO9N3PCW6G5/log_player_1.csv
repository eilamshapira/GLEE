"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $120 to me and only $100 to Bob, I should make a reasonable first offer that leaves room for negotiation but also maintains my position. I know I can always sell to John for $120, so I won't go below that.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $80 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, there's no reason to accept this low offer. While I could continue negotiating, given that the product is only worth $100 to Bob, it's unlikely we'll reach a price above $120 that would be acceptable to both parties. The most rational decision is to sell to John.
