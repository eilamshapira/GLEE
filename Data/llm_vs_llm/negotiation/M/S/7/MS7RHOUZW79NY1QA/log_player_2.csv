"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Given Alice's offer of $150, and knowing that John is also selling the product for $150, there's no advantage in accepting Alice's offer immediately. Since the product is worth up to $150 to me, I should try to negotiate with Alice for a better price before considering other options.
