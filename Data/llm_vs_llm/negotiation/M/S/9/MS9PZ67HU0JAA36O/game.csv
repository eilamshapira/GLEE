"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being open to negotiations.  $20000 is a bit more than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $14000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $14000 is a serious offer, I was thinking more along the lines of $18000, considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $18000 is still a bit outside my range.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $16000. What do you say?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. $16000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'd be willing to compromise at $17000. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you.",17000.0,Alice,5,
