Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll offer the product at a price that's closer to Bob's valuation of $150, but leaving some room for negotiation if needed.

{""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $100 is substantially below both his valuation ($150) and my initial offer ($130), and it's still well above John's fixed offer ($80), I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. There's room for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still maintain a strong position since I know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
