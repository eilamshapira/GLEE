"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $25000 is way beyond my current budget. However, I'm interested in closing the deal if we can find some common ground. I am willing to purchase the product for $9000. Please let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but I can't accept $9000 as it's below my minimum threshold. The product's value is substantially higher than that. I can come down from my initial offer to $21500. This represents a significant discount from my original price while reflecting the true value of what you're getting. Let me know if this works better for your budget.",21500.0,Alice,3,
