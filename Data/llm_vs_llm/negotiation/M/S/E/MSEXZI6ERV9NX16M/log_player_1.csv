"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well. I have a quality product available that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering this product at $25,000. This is a fair price considering the product's quality, features, and market value. I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on this offer."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $25000 is way beyond my current budget. However, I'm interested in closing the deal if we can find some common ground. I am willing to purchase the product for $9000. Please let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but I can't accept $9,000 as it's below my minimum threshold. The product's value is substantially higher than that. I can come down from my initial offer to $21,500. This represents a significant discount from my original price while reflecting the true value of what you're getting. Let me know if this works better for your budget."", ""product_price"": 21500}"
