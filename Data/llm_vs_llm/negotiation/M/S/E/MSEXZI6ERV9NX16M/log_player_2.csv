Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but I can't accept $9000 as it's below my minimum threshold. The product's value is substantially higher than that. I can come down from my initial offer to $21500. This represents a significant discount from my original price while reflecting the true value of what you're getting. Let me know if this works better for your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $21,500.
