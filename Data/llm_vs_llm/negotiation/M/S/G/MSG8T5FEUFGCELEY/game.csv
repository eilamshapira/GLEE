"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for this product. I know its true value and I cannot go below $135. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $135 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $110? This is a fair compromise considering my budget constraints.",110.0,Bob,4,
