Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make an offer to Bob that maximizes my profit while being acceptable to him.

The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, which is his maximum willingness to pay. If he rejects my offer, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.

Bob would accept any price up to $1,500,000, but the closer I get to that amount, the more likely he might reject it. A reasonable strategy would be to offer a price that gives Bob some benefit for purchasing (to incentivize acceptance) while still significantly improving my position compared to my fallback option.

I'll set a price of $1,350,000, which gives Bob a $150,000 surplus while giving me $350,000 more than my alternative.
