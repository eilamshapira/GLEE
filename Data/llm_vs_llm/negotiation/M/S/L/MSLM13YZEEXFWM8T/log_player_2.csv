"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have an amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

- The product is worth no more than $120 to me.
- Alice is offering it for $150.
- John is willing to sell the same product for $120.

Since Alice's price is above my maximum value for the product ($120), and John is offering exactly at my maximum value, the logical choice is to buy from John instead of accepting Alice's higher-priced offer.
