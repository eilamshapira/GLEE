"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $10,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative price ($8,000). It would be rational to reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice than the $8,000 alternative from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 6500}

I'll offer $6,500, which is below both my maximum value and John's price of $8,000. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing both parties to benefit. Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, this offer might be too low, but it's a starting point for negotiation. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a mutually acceptable price, while I still have John's $8,000 offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has lowered her price from $10,000 to $9,000, showing willingness to negotiate, but it's still above both my maximum value and John's price ($8,000). Since we have more rounds available and Alice has shown flexibility, it's worth continuing the negotiation to try to get a better price. If we can't reach a better deal, I can still take John's offer of $8,000 later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 7000}

I'll increase my offer to $7,000, showing movement toward a middle ground. This is a significant increase from my previous offer of $6,500, demonstrating good faith in the negotiation. The price is still below both my maximum value and John's alternative ($8,000), giving Alice room to make a profit above her $8,000 cost while potentially giving me savings compared to John's price. If Alice rejects this, I still have several rounds to negotiate or can fall back on John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $8,000. Here's why:

1. Alice's latest offer ($8,500) is still above John's price ($8,000)
2. Alice seems unlikely to go below $8,000 since that's her cost price
3. While we could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will offer a better price than John's
4. John's price ($8,000) is already at my maximum value
5. Continuing the negotiation might just waste time without achieving a better outcome

It's most rational to take John's guaranteed offer of $8,000 rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might not yield a better result."
