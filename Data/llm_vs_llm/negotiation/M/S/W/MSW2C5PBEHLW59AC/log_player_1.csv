Send your offer to Bob.,"After careful consideration, I need to determine the best price to offer Bob for my product.

Given that:
- The product is worth at least $800,000 to me
- I have a guaranteed backup buyer (John) at $800,000
- I don't know Bob's valuation of the product

I should offer a price that gives me a good chance to earn more than my fallback option, but not so high that Bob will definitely reject it.

Since I have a guaranteed $800,000 from John, I'll price the product higher for Bob, at $1,200,000. This gives me a 50% premium over my guaranteed price. If Bob accepts, I'll earn significantly more than my minimum. If he rejects, I still have my guaranteed sale to John.
