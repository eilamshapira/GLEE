"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, reject it, or buy from John.

Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is $200,000 more than what John is charging ($1,000,000). 

Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $1,000,000, it makes financial sense to buy from John rather than accepting Alice's higher price.
