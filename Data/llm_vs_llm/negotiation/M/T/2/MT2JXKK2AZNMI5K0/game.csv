"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $2000000 is significantly above what I'm looking to spend. I have another seller offering the same product for $1500000, but I'm interested in working with you if we can find a more reasonable price. Would you consider $1200000 for the product?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1200000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm proposing a price of $1700000. This reflects the unique qualities of this product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
