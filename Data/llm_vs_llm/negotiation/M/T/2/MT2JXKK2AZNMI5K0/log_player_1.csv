Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $2000000 is significantly above what I'm looking to spend. I have another seller offering the same product for $1500000, but I'm interested in working with you if we can find a more reasonable price. Would you consider $1200000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
