"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's a rare opportunity and I believe it has significant value. My asking price is $2000000.  Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $2,000,000 is above my maximum value of $1,500,000. It would not be rational to accept a price that's higher than my maximum value. Since John is offering the product at $1,500,000 (which is equal to my maximum value), I have a good alternative. However, I'll first reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer to see if I can get an even better deal before potentially buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $2,000,000 is significantly above what I'm looking to spend. I have another seller offering the same product for $1,500,000, but I'm interested in working with you if we can find a more reasonable price. Would you consider $1,200,000 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1200000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm proposing a price of $1700000. This reflects the unique qualities of this product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's new offer of $1,700,000 is still above my maximum value of $1,500,000, and John is offering the product at exactly $1,500,000, it makes the most economic sense to buy from John. While Alice has shown some flexibility by reducing the price, continuing the negotiation might not lead to a price below John's offer, and there's an opportunity cost to prolonged negotiation. Therefore, I'll take the guaranteed option of buying from John at $1,500,000."
