Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. That price seems a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $500000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $500,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and I believe the product is worth more. My counteroffer would be $1,800,000. This price still reflects the product's value and gives Bob a chance to reconsider his offer. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand that my initial offer might have been a bit high, but I believe $500,000 is too low. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to counteroffer with a price of $1,800,000."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1800000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Since Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept from John ($1,200,000), it's a good deal for me. Accepting this offer ensures I get a better price than the alternative, and it concludes the negotiation successfully."
