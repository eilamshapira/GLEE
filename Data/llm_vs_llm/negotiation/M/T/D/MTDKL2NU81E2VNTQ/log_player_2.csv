"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer is $950,000
2. My maximum value for the product is $1,000,000
3. Alice's cost is $800,000, so there's room for negotiation
4. John's fixed price is $1,000,000 (my fallback option)

Since Alice's offer ($950,000) is less than John's price ($1,000,000), but still seems high given that her cost is $800,000, I should try to negotiate for a better price. There's a $150,000 gap between Alice's cost and her offer, suggesting room for a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Let me make a strategic counteroffer:

Since Alice's cost is $800,000 and her initial offer was $950,000, I'll offer a price that's more reasonable for both parties. I want to make an offer that's significantly lower than her initial price but still profitable for her, giving room for potential negotiation.

A fair counteroffer would be $850,000, which:
1. Gives Alice a $50,000 profit above her cost
2. Is $150,000 less than her initial offer
3. Is significantly better than John's price of $1,000,000
4. Leaves room for further negotiation if needed

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice has lowered her price from $950,000 to $925,000 (a $25,000 reduction)
2. This shows she's willing to negotiate, but is moving in small increments
3. Her cost is $800,000, so there's still significant room for negotiation
4. The current offer is still better than John's price of $1,000,000
5. Since she's showing flexibility, another counteroffer might yield a better price

Given that Alice has demonstrated willingness to reduce the price and there's still a large gap between her cost ($800,000) and current offer ($925,000), it's worth trying another counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Let me make a strategic counteroffer:

Since Alice moved down $25,000 from her initial offer, I should also show some flexibility from my initial counteroffer. I'll increase my previous offer of $850,000, but still aim for a good deal.

I'll offer $875,000, which:
1. Is $25,000 higher than my previous offer, showing willingness to compromise
2. Still gives Alice a good profit ($75,000 above her cost)
3. Is $50,000 less than her current offer
4. Maintains significant savings compared to John's price
5. Shows good faith in negotiation while keeping room for potential future adjustments

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

1. Alice's price movement:
   - Started at $950,000
   - Then $925,000 (-$25,000)
   - Now $900,000 (-$25,000 more)
2. My offers:
   - First offer: $850,000
   - Second offer: $875,000
3. Alice has consistently moved down in $25,000 increments
4. The current offer of $900,000 is:
   - $100,000 better than John's price
   - $100,000 above Alice's cost
   - A fair middle ground between our positions

Given that:
- We've both shown flexibility
- The price is now reasonable
- Further negotiation might risk Alice walking away
- The savings compared to John's price are significant

I think it's wise to accept this offer.
