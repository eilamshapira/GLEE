"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product. Considering its rarity and exceptional quality, I'm prepared to offer it to you at a price that reflects its true value. I'm starting with a price of: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value
3. I can buy the same product from John for $800,000

The optimal decision is to reject Alice's offer since it's way above my maximum value. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a more reasonable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still gives room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice and $800,000 to me, I'll start low to leave room for bargaining.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I must be honest - that price is well above my budget. Given market conditions and comparable products, I can offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that provides value for both of us. Please consider my offer."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I understand your position, I'm confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I can't go as low as your counteroffer. How about we meet in the middle? I propose a price of: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,600,000 is still significantly above my maximum value of $800,000. While she did reduce her price from the initial $1,800,000, it's still double what the product is worth to me. Given that:

1. The current offer ($1,600,000) is still way above my maximum value ($800,000)
2. John's offer ($800,000) is exactly at my maximum value
3. We've already gone through 3 rounds, and Alice's price reductions are not substantial enough
4. Alice's asking price is still well above her own value ($1,500,000)

At this point, it would be most rational to buy from John. There's little indication that Alice will reduce her price enough to match or beat John's offer, and we're using up valuable negotiation rounds.
