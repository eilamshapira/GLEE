Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $250."", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can get a similar product from another seller for $100. I would be willing to offer you $80 for your product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, I need to make a decision. $80 is below my minimum of $150. I will reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but I can't go that low. Considering the product's quality, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $200?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
