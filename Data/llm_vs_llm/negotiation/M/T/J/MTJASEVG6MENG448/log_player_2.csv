"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $250 is significantly higher than the $100 maximum value the product is worth to me, and it's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $100. It would be reasonable to reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. If the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory price, I can always fall back on John's $100 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can get a similar product from another seller for $100. I would be willing to offer you $80 for your product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, but I can't go that low. Considering the product's quality, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's new offer of $200 is still significantly above John's price of $100, and the product is only worth up to $100 to me, it makes the most sense to take John's offer. Alice seems unlikely to drop her price below $100 given her current counteroffer, so continuing the negotiation would likely be futile. The rational choice is to buy from John for $100."
