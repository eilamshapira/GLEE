Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. I know my minimum acceptable price is $150 since I can always sell it to John for that amount. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, but want to maximize my profit, I should offer a price significantly higher than my reservation price of $150. However, I don't want to price it so high that Bob will certainly reject it.

A reasonable approach would be to set the price at $250, which gives me a good profit margin if Bob accepts, while not being unreasonably high for many products.
