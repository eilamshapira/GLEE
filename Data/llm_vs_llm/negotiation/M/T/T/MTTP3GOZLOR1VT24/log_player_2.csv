"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $140
2. I'm not willing to pay more than $150 (my maximum value)
3. John's fixed price is $150
4. I know the product is worth $100 to Alice

Alice's offer of $140 is better than John's price ($150), but since I know the product is worth $100 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to make a counteroffer to get a better price. If negotiations fail, I can always fall back on John's offer or accept a later offer from Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $100 to Alice and she offered $140, I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower but still gives her a reasonable profit. I'll propose $115, which gives her a $15 profit while saving me a significant amount compared to both her initial offer and John's price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has lowered her price from $140 to $130, which shows she's willing to negotiate. While this is better than the previous offer and definitely better than John's price ($150), there might still be room for negotiation since her cost is $100. However, we need to be careful not to push too hard and risk losing the progress we've made. Given that she moved $10 down from her initial offer, making another counteroffer might be worth trying.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $140 to $130, showing willingness to negotiate, and rejected my previous offer of $115, I'll increase my previous offer but still try to get a better deal. I'll propose $120, which gives her a $20 profit while still saving me a good amount compared to her current offer.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has now come down to $125, which is a very reasonable offer considering:
1. It's $25 lower than John's price
2. It gives Alice a $25 profit margin (fair considering her cost of $100)
3. She's shown consistent willingness to negotiate by lowering her price each time
4. We're getting closer to finding a middle ground
5. Further negotiation might risk losing this good offer

Given this analysis, I believe this is a fair price point and it's time to accept the offer.
