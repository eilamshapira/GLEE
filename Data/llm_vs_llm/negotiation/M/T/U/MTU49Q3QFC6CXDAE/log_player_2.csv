"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it will be a great fit for your needs and provide you with excellent value. I'm offering it to you at a competitive price that reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($10,000) and buying from John would cost the same, I see no advantage in rejecting the offer or buying from John at this point. Therefore, I will accept Alice's offer to simplify the transaction process.
