"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be very interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for a price of... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given the information provided, Alice is offering the product for $12,000, while John is willing to sell the same product for $10,000. Since:

1. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to you
2. John's offer is already at $10,000
3. Alice's offer ($12,000) exceeds both your maximum valuation and John's alternative price

The rational decision would be to buy from John instead of accepting Alice's higher-priced offer.
