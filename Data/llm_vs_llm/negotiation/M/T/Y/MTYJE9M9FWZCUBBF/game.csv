"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's quite a bit above my budget. I'm thinking of something closer to $6000. Can we work within that range?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. Honestly, $6000 is too low for the value this product provides. How about we meet closer to the middle and set the price at $16000? I think this would be a fair deal for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Alice, but $16000 is still a bit steep for me. Can we settle for $8000 instead? This way, we're still moving up from my initial offer.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your patience, Bob. I understand budgets can be tight, but I'm confident in the quality and value this product offers. Would you consider $14000? I believe it's a reasonable compromise given both our positions.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I see that we're still a bit apart on the price, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $10000? This way, both of us give a little.",10000.0,Bob,6,
