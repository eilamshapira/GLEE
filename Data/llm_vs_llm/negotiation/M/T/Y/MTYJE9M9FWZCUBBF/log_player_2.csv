Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. Honestly, $6000 is too low for the value this product provides. How about we meet closer to the middle and set the price at $16000? I think this would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience, Bob. I understand budgets can be tight, but I'm confident in the quality and value this product offers. Would you consider $14000? I believe it's a reasonable compromise given both our positions.
