"Alice, $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in your product, but I can only go up to $1200000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $1200000 is below our minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $1800000, considering your interest in the product. Let me know if this works for you.",1800000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1700000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to work with you. What are your thoughts?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1700000 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $1450000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, $1450000 is still below what we can accept. I'm willing to lower my price further to $1600000. This is a very competitive offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1600000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but I need to ensure we meet our minimum requirements. I'm willing to drop the price to $1550000. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1550000 is still above what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, which is my absolute final offer. If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to explore other options. ",1400000.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but it's still below our minimum threshold. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase the product at a price that meets our requirements. Therefore, I will be selling the product to John for $1500000. Thank you for your interest.",,Alice,6,SellToJhon
