"Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. I'm interested in buying it, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and reflects my desire to work with you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for coming down to $12000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9500.0,Bob,4,
