"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to offer $8500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer to Bob. This offer of $8,500 is too close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and I know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob. There's still room for negotiation to reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot go that low. This product has significant value, and while I want to work with you, I need to ensure a fair price. I can reduce my initial asking price to $9,000, which represents a substantial discount and is a very reasonable price given the product's value."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value, but my budget is a bit tight. Would you consider $8600? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $8,600. While it's lower than what I initially wanted, it's still $600 better than John's standing offer of $8,000. Given that Bob stated this is his final offer, pushing further might risk losing the deal altogether, and I'd have to settle for John's lower price. This way, I secure a deal that's above my minimum threshold and still provides some additional profit."
