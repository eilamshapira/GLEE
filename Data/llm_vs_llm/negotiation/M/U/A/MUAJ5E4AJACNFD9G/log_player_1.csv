Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to set a price that maximizes my profit while ensuring Bob still accepts the offer. Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, I want to capture as much of that value as possible while still giving him enough incentive to accept.

If I price too high, Bob might reject it and I'll only get $80 from John. If I price too low, I leave money on the table. The optimal strategy is to price it somewhat below Bob's valuation of $150, but significantly above my minimum of $80.
