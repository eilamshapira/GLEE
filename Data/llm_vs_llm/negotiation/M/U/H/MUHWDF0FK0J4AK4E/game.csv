"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe could be of significant value to you. I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1600000. This is a competitive price considering the product's quality and benefits.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a significantly lower price, considering my budget constraints. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $700000 is far below the product's actual value and what I could accept. The product is worth at least $1500000 to me, which is what another buyer, John, is already willing to pay. However, I'd like to give you an opportunity to purchase it if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer it to you for $1500000, which matches my minimum acceptable price.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price to $1500000. However, I still find it above my budget. Considering that I can purchase the product from John for $800000, I'd like to make a more reasonable offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and John's price. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $900000.",900000.0,Bob,4,
