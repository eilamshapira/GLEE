Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $700000 is far below the product's actual value and what I could accept. The product is worth at least $1500000 to me, which is what another buyer, John, is already willing to pay. However, I'd like to give you an opportunity to purchase it if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer it to you for $1500000, which matches my minimum acceptable price.
