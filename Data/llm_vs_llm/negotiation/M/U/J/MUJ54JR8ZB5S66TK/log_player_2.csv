"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it's a great investment for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a lower price from Alice first. Her starting offer is the maximum I'm willing to pay, so there's room to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This offer is a significant reduction from Alice's starting price, but still leaves room for further negotiation. It lets her know I'm serious about buying, but not at any cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concern about the price. However, the product is indeed quite valuable. How about we settle at $9000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice is coming down, which is good. However, there's still room for improvement. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

This offer is right at Alice's value for the product.  It's a fair deal for both of us.  We'll see if she's willing to accept it."
