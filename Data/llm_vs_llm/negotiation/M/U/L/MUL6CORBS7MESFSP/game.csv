"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $1400000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below what I believe is fair value for this product. Given its quality and market position, I can offer it to you for $1700000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents a fair deal for both parties.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
