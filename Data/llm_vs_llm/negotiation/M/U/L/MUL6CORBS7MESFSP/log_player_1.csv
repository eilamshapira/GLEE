"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,000,000. This is a competitive price for a product of this caliber."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1400000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is better than John's $1,200,000, but since Bob is willing to offer $1,400,000 so quickly after my initial offer, it suggests he might value the product significantly higher. I'll reject this offer and make a lower counteroffer than my initial $2,000,000, but still higher than his $1,400,000, to see if we can find a middle ground that's more profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $1,400,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below what I believe is fair value for this product. Given its quality and market position, I can offer it to you for $1,700,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents a fair deal for both parties."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
