"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given the information:
- The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
- Alice is offering it for $1,500,000
- John is willing to sell it for $800,000

Alice's offer ($1,500,000) is significantly higher than the maximum value the product has to me ($800,000). Additionally, it's significantly higher than John's alternative offer ($800,000).

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer, and even making a counteroffer seems unnecessary since John's price matches my maximum valuation.
