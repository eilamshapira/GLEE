Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer of $800,000 from John
3. Bob will only accept if the price is at or below his valuation of $1,200,000
4. I want to maximize my profit while ensuring Bob is likely to accept

Given these factors, I'll offer the product at $1,000,000. This:
- Gives Bob a $200,000 surplus (incentive to accept)
- Gives me $200,000 more than my minimum acceptable price
- Is significantly better than my backup option with John
