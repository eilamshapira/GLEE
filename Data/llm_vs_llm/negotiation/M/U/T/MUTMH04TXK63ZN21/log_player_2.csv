"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: Pay $1,000,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: Pay $1,200,000

The product is worth up to $1,200,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is $200,000 less than what John is offering. This is a good deal because:
- It's below my maximum value ($1,200,000)
- It saves me $200,000 compared to buying from John
- While Alice's profit is $200,000 (selling at $1M - her value of $800K), I still get a better deal than my alternative
