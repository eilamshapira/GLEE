"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's initial offer is $120, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I don't see any benefit in accepting the offer immediately. I'd like to try to negotiate a better price. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial offer. Since I don't know the value of the product to Alice, I'll start with a relatively conservative offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that you're interested in the product, but I think $90 is a bit too low. Let's meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $105 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but it's getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with. Since I have 8 rounds left, I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll respond to Alice's $105 offer by making a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous offer of $90, but still lower than $105.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $98. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 98}"
