Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be honest about my budget constraints. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me, which is the price John is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $500000 for the product, which gives you a quick sale while allowing me some room in my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me ($1,200,000) and John's offer, I will reject it and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'd like to try to reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your honest response and for considering doing business with me. I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, but I'm afraid $500,000 is below my expectations. Given the product's value and the fact that I have another offer on the table, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer the product to you for $1,800,000, which is still a bit below my initial price but takes into account your budget constraints. I'm open to further negotiations if needed."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to emphasize that I have a firm alternative option with John at $800000, which represents the absolute maximum this product is worth to me. To make it worth choosing you over John, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $650000, which would give you a quick, guaranteed sale while still providing me with some value compared to my alternative option. My budget simply cannot accommodate anything close to $1.8 million. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will reject Bob's offer of $650,000, as it is still significantly lower than the product's value to me ($1,200,000) and John's offer. While Bob has increased his offer, it's not enough to justify selling the product to him at this price. I'll proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer, trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm getting closer to considering selling the product to John if Bob's offers don't improve substantially."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer and for sharing more information about your alternative option. I understand that you have a firm maximum value in mind, but I still believe we can find a better compromise. Considering your constraints and my own minimum requirements, I'm willing to make a more significant concession. I'd like to offer the product to you for $1,500,000, which is substantially lower than my initial price and closer to your maximum value. I'm hoping this revised offer will be more appealing to you and allow us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I think we need to be realistic about where we stand. My maximum budget is $800000 - that's what John is offering and it's the true ceiling of what this product is worth to me. Your last offer of $1.5 million is still nearly double that amount. I'd like to make one final offer of $750000, which is very close to my absolute maximum. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to proceed with John's offer, as I simply cannot justify spending significantly more than the product's value to me. I hope we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Given Bob's final offer of $750,000 and his clear indication that he cannot justify spending significantly more than that, I believe it's unlikely that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Since John is offering $1,200,000, which is substantially higher than Bob's offer and meets my minimum requirements, I decide to sell the product to John. This ensures that I receive a fair price for the product and avoids further negotiations that are unlikely to result in a better outcome."
