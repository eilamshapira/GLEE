"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $2000000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that I know the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $800,000, Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is far too high. Alice's starting price is more than double what the product is worth to me.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be honest about my budget constraints. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, which is the price John is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product, which gives you a quick sale while allowing me some room in my budget."", ""product_price"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your honest response and for considering doing business with me. I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, but I'm afraid $500000 is below my expectations. Given the product's value and the fact that I have another offer on the table, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer the product to you for $1800000, which is still a bit below my initial price but takes into account your budget constraints. I'm open to further negotiations if needed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,800,000 is still significantly higher than my maximum value for the product ($800,000) and higher than John's price. While Alice has reduced her price, she's still asking for more than double what I'm willing to pay. Since we still seem quite far apart in our valuation, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to emphasize that I have a firm alternative option with John at $800,000, which represents the absolute maximum this product is worth to me. To make it worth choosing you over John, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $650,000, which would give you a quick, guaranteed sale while still providing me with some value compared to my alternative option. My budget simply cannot accommodate anything close to $1.8 million."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer and for sharing more information about your alternative option. I understand that you have a firm maximum value in mind, but I still believe we can find a better compromise. Considering your constraints and my own minimum requirements, I'm willing to make a more significant concession. I'd like to offer the product to you for $1500000, which is substantially lower than my initial price and closer to your maximum value. I'm hoping this revised offer will be more appealing to you and allow us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's latest offer of $1,500,000 is still almost double my maximum value for the product ($800,000) and John's price. While Alice continues to reduce her price, we're still very far apart in our valuations. At this point, I need to consider whether we'll be able to bridge this substantial gap. Since we have limited rounds and Alice's price reductions are relatively small, I'll reject this offer and make one more attempt at a counteroffer.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I think we need to be realistic about where we stand. My maximum budget is $800,000 - that's what John is offering and it's the true ceiling of what this product is worth to me. Your last offer of $1.5 million is still nearly double that amount. I'd like to make one final offer of $750,000, which is very close to my absolute maximum. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to proceed with John's offer, as I simply cannot justify spending significantly more than the product's value to me. I hope we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
