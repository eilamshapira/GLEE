Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider this price?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Considering Bob's counteroffer of $8,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $10,000, I'm going to reject his offer and counter.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the offer Bob, but I can't accept $8,000. I'm confident we can reach a better agreement. Let's try this: I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15,000. What do you say?""}"

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again, but this time I'll give him a slightly lower price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Thanks, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am afraid that I can't accept $9,500. I will do the following: I am ready to sell it to you for $14,000. What do you think?""}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Alright Bob, I see your point. How about we try $13,000? I am sure that it's a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
