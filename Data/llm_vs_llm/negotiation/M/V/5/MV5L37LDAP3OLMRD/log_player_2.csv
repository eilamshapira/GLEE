"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to decide which option makes the most economic sense for me.

Given the information:
- Alice is offering the product for $15,000
- The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
- John is willing to sell the same product for $12,000

Since Alice's offer exceeds the maximum value I place on the product ($12,000), and John's offer exactly matches my maximum valuation, the rational choice is to buy from John.
