"Alice, while I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $5000000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it. Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $800000 is significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $4000000. This is still a great deal considering the value and uniqueness of the product. What do you think?",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but let's meet halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $3000000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to work with you. What do you say?",3000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $3000000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $900000. This is a fair offer considering my budget constraints. Let me know if you can accept this.",900000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $900000 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down further to $2500000. This is a substantial discount, and I believe it's a fair price for the value the product offers. What do you think?",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're still far apart on the price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $2000000. This is my best offer considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",2000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $2000000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1000000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. Please consider this offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While $1000000 is a significant increase, I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This is my final offer before considering other options. What do you say?",,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle. Given the unique value of the product, I'm willing to lower my price to $1250000. This is my final offer before I consider other buyers. Please let me know if this works for you.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
