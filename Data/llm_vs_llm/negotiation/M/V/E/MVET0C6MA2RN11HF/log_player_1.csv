Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price to offer Bob:

1. I know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed fallback of $1,200,000 from John
3. Since I don't know Bob's maximum willingness to pay, I should aim high while keeping the offer somewhat reasonable
4. A significant markup from my minimum value would be appropriate

{""product_price"": 1,800,000}"
