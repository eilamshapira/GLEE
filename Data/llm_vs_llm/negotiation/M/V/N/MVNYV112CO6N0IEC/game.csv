"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth a substantial sum. I'm willing to part with it for $1500000.  This is a fair price, given its value and potential.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1000000 is significantly below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This represents a fair compromise and still allows me to get a decent return on this valuable product.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1100000 is still a bit lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. This price reflects the true value of the product while ensuring we both reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
