"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000), and I know I can get the same product from John for the same price, I don't see any benefit in accepting Alice's offer without trying to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I'll start by making a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. I'll offer $900,000, which is higher than Alice's worth but leaves room for further negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,100,000 is still higher than I'd like to pay, but it's a $100,000 reduction from her initial offer, which shows she's willing to negotiate. Since I know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I believe there's still room for further negotiation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's latest offer was $1,100,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between her latest offer and my previous counteroffer of $900,000. I'll offer $1,000,000, which is still higher than Alice's worth but shows I'm willing to compromise.
