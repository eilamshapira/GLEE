Send your offer to Bob.,"Considering my position, I need to balance the risk of Bob rejecting a high offer against the certainty of selling to John for $8,000.

Since I know I can get $8,000 from John as a guaranteed alternative, I'll offer Bob a higher price that gives me a better return while still potentially being attractive to him.
