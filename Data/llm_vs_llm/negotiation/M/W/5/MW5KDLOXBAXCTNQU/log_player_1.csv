"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **High initial anchor:** I'm starting with a price significantly above my minimum ($12,000). This sets a high initial anchor and gives me room to negotiate downwards.
*   **Potential for profit:** While I don't know Bob's valuation, there's a chance he values the product highly and might accept this offer outright.
*   **Information gathering:** Bob's response will give me valuable information about his perceived value of the product. A quick rejection suggests a lower valuation, while a counteroffer indicates he's interested but at a lower price.
*   **Balancing risk and reward:** I'm being aggressive but not so outrageous that Bob immediately walks away. I need to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is far too low. My minimum acceptable price is $12,000, and selling for $8,000 would be a significant loss. I still have 9 rounds left to negotiate, and selling to John for $12,000 is also an option. Therefore, it is best to continue negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for Round 3:

```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Rejecting the anchor:** Bob's initial offer was very low. This counteroffer rejects that price range and attempts to re-anchor the negotiation at a higher point.
*   **Showing flexibility (but not too much):** I'm decreasing the price from my initial offer of $18,000, indicating that I'm willing to negotiate. However, the decrease is not substantial.
*   **Maintaining Profit Margin:** $16,000 still provides a significant profit margin above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
*   **Information gathering:** His reaction to this offer will be crucial in assessing his true valuation of the product. A small increase in his counteroffer would indicate strong interest, while another lowball offer might suggest he's not a serious buyer or has a much lower valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer increased by only $1,000. He is likely trying to wear me down with small increments, while still remaining far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I still have the option of selling to John for $12,000. With 7 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, I'll reject this offer and try to get Bob closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Meeting in the middle (sort of):** Bob's last offer was $9,000, and my last offer was $16,000. This counteroffer of $14,500 represents a move towards the middle, but still favors me significantly.
*   **Protecting my minimum:** It remains well above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, ensuring a profitable sale.
*   **Testing Bob's commitment:** By lowering the price by a significant amount this round, I'm testing how serious Bob is about buying. If he's truly interested, this should encourage a more substantial increase in his next offer. If he only increases by a small amount again, it will signal that he may not be a worthwhile buyer.
*   **More appealing psychology:** A larger price drop is more psychologically appealing than a small one, and might encourage Bob to think he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently lowballing me and only increasing his offers in increments of $1,000. He is still $2,000 below my minimum of $12,000. With only 5 rounds left, and the trend suggesting he won't reach my minimum in that timeframe, continuing negotiation is unlikely to be profitable. I have a guaranteed $12,000 available by selling to John, so I will take that guaranteed profit now."
