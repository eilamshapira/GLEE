"Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at $18000. This product has exceptional quality and features that make it worth the investment. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. I can offer you $4000 for the product. Would you be willing to accept this price?",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $4000 as this is well below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. The product is worth at least $10000 to me, and I have another buyer ready at that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $15000, which is still a fair price considering the product's quality and value. Would this work for you?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $15000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $5000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value the product can bring to me. Would you reconsider?",5000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for increasing your offer, but $5000 is still significantly below what I can accept. I should mention that I have a standing offer from another buyer for $10000, which represents my absolute minimum. However, I believe this product would be particularly valuable for you, and I'd like to continue our negotiation. I can reduce my price to $13500, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. Can you meet me closer to this figure?",13500.0,Alice,5,
