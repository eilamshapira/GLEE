Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $4000 as this is well below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. The product is worth at least $10000 to me, and I have another buyer ready at that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $15000, which is still a fair price considering the product's quality and value. Would this work for you?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for increasing your offer, but $5000 is still significantly below what I can accept. I should mention that I have a standing offer from another buyer for $10000, which represents my absolute minimum. However, I believe this product would be particularly valuable for you, and I'd like to continue our negotiation. I can reduce my price to $13500, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. Can you meet me closer to this figure?
