"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. Alice's offer is $120, which is $30 less than my maximum value
3. I have the option to counter-offer, which might get me an even better price
4. If negotiations fail, I can always buy from John at $150

Given that $120 is a reasonable price (20% below my maximum value), and there's a risk that Alice might increase the price if I make a counteroffer, I think it's best to accept this offer.
