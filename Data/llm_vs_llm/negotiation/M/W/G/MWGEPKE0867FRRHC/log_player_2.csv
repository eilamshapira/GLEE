"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to consider Alice's initial offer of $13,500. The product is worth up to $15,000 to me, and I know it costs Alice $8,000. I have the option to buy from John at $15,000, but Alice's offer is already better than that.

However, there's room for negotiation since Alice has a $5,500 profit margin ($13,500 - $8,000). I should try to get a better price by making a counteroffer.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price from $13,500 to $12,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is a good sign, but there's still room for further negotiation since her cost is $8,000. Her current offer would give her a $4,000 profit margin, while I'd save $3,000 compared to John's price.

I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice is continuing to lower her price, now to $11,500. We're making progress in the negotiation. She's moved down $500 from her previous offer of $12,000, while I moved up $800 from my initial counteroffer.

The current offer would give Alice a $3,500 profit margin, which is still substantial. I'll continue negotiating to try to find a better price, as we're only in round 5 of 10.
