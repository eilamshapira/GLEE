"Alice, while I acknowledge the quality of your product, $1200000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $850000, which is a fair price given my maximum spending limit.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that we're still a bit apart on the price. To show our commitment to reaching an agreement, we're willing to lower our price to $1050000. This is a very competitive price given the value of the product, and we hope you'll meet us halfway.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that $900000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
