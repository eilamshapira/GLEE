"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to evaluate this offer based on my goal of buying the product while saving as much money as possible.

Alice is offering the product for $10,000, but the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me. John is offering the same product for $8,000.

Since Alice's price ($10,000) exceeds both the value to me and John's alternative price, the logical choice is to buy from John for $8,000.
