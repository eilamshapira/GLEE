"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're working within a budget, but $400000 is significantly below the product's value. Given this, I'd like to propose a more reasonable price of $1500000. I believe this price better reflects the potential and quality of the product.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down from your initial offer, but $1500000 is still far too high for me. I understand you believe the product is valuable, but my valuation remains much lower. I can offer $500000.",500000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your continued interest, Bob, but $500000 still doesn't align with the product's value. To hopefully find a middle ground, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
