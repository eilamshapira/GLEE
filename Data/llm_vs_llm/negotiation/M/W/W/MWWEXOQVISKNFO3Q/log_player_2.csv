"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. Given its value and potential, I'd like to offer it to you for $1800000. I believe this is a fair starting point given the market potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me. Alice is offering it for $1,800,000. That's way too high. Buying from John for $800,000 is a possibility, but I have 10 rounds to try to get a better price from Alice.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, time to make a counteroffer. I need to anchor the price much lower, but not so low that Alice immediately rejects the negotiation. I will start with a significantly lower offer to signal my valuation.

```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial price is far above my valuation. I am interested in the product, but my maximum budget is significantly lower. I can offer $400,000."", ""product_price"": 400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're working within a budget, but $400000 is significantly below the product's value. Given this, I'd like to propose a more reasonable price of $1500000. I believe this price better reflects the potential and quality of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice is still way out of range. $1,500,000 is still too high. I need to continue negotiating.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alright, time to counter again. Alice has only come down $300,000 from her initial price. I need to be firm, but I also want to avoid breaking off negotiations. I'll increase my offer slightly, but still keep it well below my maximum valuation.

```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down from your initial offer, but $1,500,000 is still far too high for me. I understand you believe the product is valuable, but my valuation remains much lower. I can offer $500,000."", ""product_price"": 500000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest, Bob, but $500000 still doesn't align with the product's value. To hopefully find a middle ground, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice is inching closer, but still far from acceptable. $1,300,000 is way more than what I value the product. I'll reject and make another counteroffer.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alright, time to counter again. She has came down $200,000 from previous round.
I will stick to my strategy and increase my offer slightly, but still keep it well below my maximum valuation.

```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I am still far away from your price. My maximum price I can pay for the product is $600,000"", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
