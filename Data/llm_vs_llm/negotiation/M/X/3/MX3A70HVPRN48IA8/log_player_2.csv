"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an exclusive product that I'm offering at $150. If you're interested, let me knowâ€”otherwise, I'll be selling it for $100 to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to evaluate whether Alice's offer is worth accepting based on my constraints and alternatives.

Alice is offering the product for $150, but the product is only worth up to $100 to me. Additionally, I have the option to buy the same product from John for $100.

Since the value of the product to me is no more than $100, and I can get it for exactly $100 from John, there's no reason to pay $150 to Alice. That would be paying $50 more than the product's value to me.
