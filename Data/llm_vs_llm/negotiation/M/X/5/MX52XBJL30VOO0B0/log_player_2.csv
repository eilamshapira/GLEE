"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
 
 Alice's starting price is too high. It's best to counter-offer and see if she's willing to negotiate down closer to a price I find acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how Alice responds. This gives us room to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice came down slightly, but it's still not a great deal. I'll reject and propose a counter-offer that moves us closer to a reasonable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer to show I'm willing to move, but this price is still significantly lower than her current offer. Let's see if she's willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

We're getting closer. While $8,500 is getting more reasonable, I believe I can still get a better price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

This offer represents a good compromise between my previous offer and Alice's last price. It keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price well below John's offer."
