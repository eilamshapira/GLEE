"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a high initial offer allows room for negotiation and helps gauge Bob's interest level. This price is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, leaving space for potential concessions while aiming for a highly profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Accepting would result in a substantial loss. It's highly likely we can negotiate a better deal, so I will counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1400000}

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer was extremely low, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by significantly decreasing my initial price. This counter-offer still provides a substantial profit margin while hopefully encouraging Bob to engage in more reasonable bargaining."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer has increased, showing movement, but it's still considerably below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further as long as there's upward movement from his side."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1250000}

**Reasoning:** I am decreasing my price by a smaller amount this round, signaling that I am approaching my bottom line. This offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price but still allows for some potential profit beyond that. This should encourage Bob to make a more serious offer if he's truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's still too far from my minimum to accept. I need to signal that I'm getting closer to my limit and may walk away soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:** I'm making a smaller concession this time to emphasize that I'm nearing my lowest acceptable price. This offer still provides a reasonable profit margin while keeping the negotiation open.  Bob needs to make a significant jump in his next offer to keep this deal alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is not increasing at a rate that suggests we will reach an agreement. He's still substantially below my minimum, and I'm not confident in his willingness to meet my valuation. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
