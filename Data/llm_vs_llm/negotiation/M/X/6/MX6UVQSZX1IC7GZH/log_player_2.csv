(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's always worth exploring if you can get a better deal.  Let's see if we can negotiate with Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

Let's start with a significant counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is still a good price for me, and hopefully gives Alice some room to negotiate."
