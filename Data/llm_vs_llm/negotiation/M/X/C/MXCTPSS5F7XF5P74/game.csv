"Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking of a price point that is a bit lower. Given my budget and the market conditions, I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I understand you have budget constraints, but the value of this asset far exceeds your proposed $900000. How about we meet in the middle a bit? I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer and represents a significant opportunity for you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we seem to be quite far apart still. While I appreciate you meeting my minimum, I truly believe you are underestimating the potential of this asset. I am willing to come down to $1350000. This is my final significant reduction, and I believe it's a very fair price, considering its value to you is $1500000.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I need to stick to my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000. This is a significant move from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to reach an agreement, but I'm still willing to negotiate in good faith. I'll come down to $1300000. This is getting very close to my absolute bottom line. I urge you to seriously consider this, given the value you'll receive in return.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
