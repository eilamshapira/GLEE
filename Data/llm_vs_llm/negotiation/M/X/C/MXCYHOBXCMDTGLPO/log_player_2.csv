(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,000,000, I will reject her offer. I still want to try to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, I'll offer a price that is lower than that.

I'm not willing to pay more than $1,000,000, so I'll reject her offer again. I'll also consider the fact that I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is my maximum budget.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one, but still below $1,000,000. I'll try to meet Alice halfway between her last offer and my previous counteroffer.
