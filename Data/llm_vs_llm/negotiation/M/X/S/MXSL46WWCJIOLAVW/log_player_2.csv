"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since the product is only worth $100 to me and John is willing to sell it for $100, there's no way I would accept Alice's offer of $200. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If we can't reach a deal below $100, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 75}

I'll offer $75, which is significantly below John's price of $100. This gives room for negotiation while still ensuring I can get a better deal than John's offer. If Alice rejects this, I can gradually increase my offer in subsequent rounds, but I'll never go above $100 since that's my maximum value for the product and John's asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $175 is still well above my maximum value of $100 and higher than John's price. While she did reduce her price from $200 to $175, it's still not a good deal for me. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. If Alice continues to offer prices above $100, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 85}

I'll increase my offer slightly to $85, showing some willingness to negotiate while still staying well below my maximum value of $100. This keeps plenty of room for future negotiation if needed, while also showing Alice that I'm willing to move up from my initial offer. However, I'm maintaining a firm position that I won't go above $100 since I have John's offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $165 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). While Alice is gradually lowering her price, she's not coming down fast enough to reach a price that would be acceptable to me. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. If Alice continues to offer prices well above $100, I might need to consider taking John's offer soon, as we've already used half of our available rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 90}

I'll offer $90, which is my highest offer so far. This shows continued willingness to negotiate while still staying under my maximum value and John's price of $100. We're more than halfway through our available rounds, so I'm making a more substantial increase in my offer to show good faith. However, I'm still maintaining a firm position that I won't exceed $100, as that would be irrational given both my maximum value and John's alternative offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice is still offering $160, which is well above my maximum value of $100
2. We've gone through 7 rounds, and Alice's price reductions have been very small (from $200 to $160)
3. The pace of price reduction suggests Alice is unlikely to reach $100 or below in the remaining rounds
4. John's offer of $100 matches my maximum value
5. There's no point in continuing negotiations when we have a guaranteed acceptable option available

It's time to end the negotiation and take the sure deal with John rather than risk using up more rounds with Alice when she seems unwilling to offer a competitive price."
