(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $50 is significantly lower than my initial offer and also lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($150), and I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate, I will choose to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

My counteroffer will be $190.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer of $70 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. At this point, I've made several concessions from my initial offer, and Bob's offers, although increasing, are not getting closer to a reasonable price.

Considering I have 4 rounds left and the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob, I will reject his offer again. However, I will also start to consider the option of selling to John for $150 if the negotiations do not improve significantly.

My counteroffer will be $170.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer of $80 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. With only 2 rounds left, I'm starting to lose confidence that Bob will meet my price. Given that Bob's offers have been increasing very slowly and we are running out of time, I'm inclined to think that selling to John for $150 might be the best option to ensure I get a fair price for the product.

However, I will make one more attempt to negotiate with Bob. If he doesn't significantly increase his offer in the next round, I will sell to John.

My counteroffer will be $160.
