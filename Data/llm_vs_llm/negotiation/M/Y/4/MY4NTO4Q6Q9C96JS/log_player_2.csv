# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am offering you the opportunity to purchase our exclusive product. Given its unique value and benefits, I am proposing a price of $2000000. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and the price John offers. It makes the most sense to buy from John in this scenario."
