"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product, I'll start by making a relatively high offer. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially settle on a higher price.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is lower than the minimum value of $12,000 that I have for the product, I will reject his offer. Selling the product to John for $12,000 is a safer option, but I still want to try to negotiate with Bob to see if I can get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $10,000, which is lower than my minimum value, I'll make a counteroffer that is still relatively high, but slightly lower than my initial offer. This will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still expect a good price for the product.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $11,000 is still lower than my desired price, but it's getting closer. However, since I have the option to sell the product to John for $12,000, which is higher than Bob's offer, I will reject Bob's offer and consider my next move. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get an even better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $11,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous one, but still higher than Bob's offer. I want to create a sense of momentum in the negotiation and encourage Bob to meet me in the middle.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still lower than the $12,000 that I can get from John. Since I only have 4 rounds left, I need to decide whether to continue negotiating with Bob or take the guaranteed $12,000 from John. Considering that Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, I'll reject his offer and try to get him to meet me at $12,000 or slightly higher.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $11,500, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than his offer, but still close to the $12,000 that I can get from John. I want to test Bob's willingness to pay a premium for the product.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $12,000 matches the minimum value that I have for the product, and it's the same price that I can get from John. Since I've negotiated with Bob for several rounds, I'd like to give him the opportunity to buy the product at this price. Accepting his offer will also save me the uncertainty of further negotiation.
