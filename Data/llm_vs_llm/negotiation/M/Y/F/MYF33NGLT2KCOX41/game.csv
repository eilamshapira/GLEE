"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I believe $1500000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, I cannot accept $1000000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I can adjust my initial offer - how about $1350000? This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents good value for this product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the new offer, Alice. I understand your position, but $1350000 is still beyond what I'm willing to spend. I can go up to $1100000. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if you can meet me at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
