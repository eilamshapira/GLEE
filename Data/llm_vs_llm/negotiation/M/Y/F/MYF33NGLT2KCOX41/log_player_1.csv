Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great fit for you. Given its market value and unique features, I'm offering it at $1,500,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I believe $1500000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is below even the minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I can always sell to John at $1,200,000, so there's no reason to accept anything lower than that from Bob.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, I cannot accept $1,000,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I can adjust my initial offer - how about $1,350,000? This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents good value for this product."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the new offer, Alice. I understand your position, but $1350000 is still beyond what I'm willing to spend. I can go up to $1100000. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if you can meet me at this price.

I'll sell to John for $1,200,000. Bob's final offer of $1,100,000 is still below what John is willing to pay, and since Bob indicated this is his final offer, it's unlikely we'll reach a better price through further negotiation. Taking John's guaranteed $1,200,000 is the most profitable choice."
