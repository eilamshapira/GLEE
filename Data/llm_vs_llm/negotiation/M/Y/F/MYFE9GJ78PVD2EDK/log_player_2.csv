"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $12,500 is still above the midpoint between my maximum budget of $15,000 and Alice's worth of $8,000, I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly above Alice's worth, but still significantly lower than her initial offer. This will give us room to negotiate and potentially find a mutually beneficial price.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $11,200 is a step in the right direction, but it's still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Since we're only in Round 3, I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and try to make a more reasonable counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's previous offer of $11,200 and my previous counteroffer of $9,000, I'll try to meet her halfway. I'll increase my offer by $1,000 to show that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price.

{""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $10,800 is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with. However, I still think I can get a better deal. Since we're halfway through the negotiation rounds, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one, but still lower than Alice's current offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer of $10,000 by $400, to $10,400. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and meet Alice halfway, while still trying to get the best possible price.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $10,600 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $10,400. At this point, I think we're getting close to a mutually beneficial price. Considering that Alice's worth is $8,000 and I'm willing to pay up to $15,000, $10,600 seems like a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer to avoid the risk of Alice not accepting a lower counteroffer and to ensure I get the product.
