"Bob, I appreciate the counteroffer, but $7000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I value this product at $8000, and I am willing to sell it to John for that price right now. Let's try to get closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. How about $9000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that $7000 was too low, but $9000 is still a bit steep for me. Considering you're willing to sell it to John for $8000, I'd like to propose a compromise. How about we meet in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle. However, I'm very firm on not going below $8000. Since I have the option to sell to John for that price, I will have to reject your offer. I am confident you would see value in it for $8500. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,
