"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Given its rarity and high demand, I believe it's worth a premium price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000, which I think is a fair value considering its unique features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's initial offer is exactly at the maximum value I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000), and I have the option to buy the same product from John for the same price, I see no benefit in accepting Alice's offer without trying to negotiate a better price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in hopes of getting a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable considering I'm interested in the product. Let's start with a counteroffer of $600,000, which is half of Alice's initial offer and also half of the maximum value I'm willing to pay.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. This price takes into account the product's unique features and the value it can bring to you. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe this price is more in line with the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has come down from her initial offer of $1,200,000 to $1,000,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming to save as much money as possible. Since Alice's new offer is $1,000,000 and I initially counteroffered with $600,000, there's a significant gap between our prices. I'll try to meet Alice halfway between my last offer and her new offer to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.

The midpoint between $600,000 and $1,000,000 is $800,000. I'll make a counteroffer of $800,000 to see how Alice responds.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my counteroffer is: $800,000."
