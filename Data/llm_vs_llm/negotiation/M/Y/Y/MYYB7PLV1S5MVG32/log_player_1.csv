Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Considering my minimum value is $1,000,000 and Bob's offer is exactly that, I have a tough decision. However, I want to maximize my profit. I also know I can sell it to John for that price. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.
