{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While I'm willing to pay up to $1,500,000, there's no harm in seeing if Alice might accept a lower price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to gauge Alice's potential selling range. This leaves room for negotiation while still being a substantial sum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice reducing her price suggests there's room for further negotiation. While $1,400,000 is closer to my budget, I'll aim for a slightly better deal before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer to show willingness to negotiate but staying significantly below Alice's current offer. This keeps the pressure on Alice to either accept a lower price or reveal more about her desired range."
