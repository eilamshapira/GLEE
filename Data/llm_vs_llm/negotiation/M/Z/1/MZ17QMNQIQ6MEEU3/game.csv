"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $4000 is quite lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Here's a revised offer that I think is more reasonable.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for increasing your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $6000 is still a bit far from what I'm looking for.
