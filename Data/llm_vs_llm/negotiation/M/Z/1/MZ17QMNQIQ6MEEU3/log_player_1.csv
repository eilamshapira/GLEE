Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was looking for a better deal. I'm willing to purchase the product for $4000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as his offer of $4000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and the minimum value I have for the product. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial price. 

My counteroffer to Bob: $18,000."

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer of $6000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Since I have the option to sell the product to John for $15,000, I'll continue to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a price closer to my initial offer. 

My counteroffer to Bob: $16,000."
