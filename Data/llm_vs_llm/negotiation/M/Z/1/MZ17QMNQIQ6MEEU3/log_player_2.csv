# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $4000 is quite lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Here's a revised offer that I think is more reasonable.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for increasing your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $6000 is still a bit far from what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down slightly from my previous offer, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Here's a revised offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","**{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}**

It seems that Alice's price is still quite high compared to my maximum budget. It's better to buy the product from John for $8,000."
