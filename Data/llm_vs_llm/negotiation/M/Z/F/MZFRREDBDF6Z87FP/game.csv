"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks interesting, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that the initial price might have been a bit steep, but $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'll meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the effort to find a compromise. How about we settle at $80? That feels like a fair deal to me.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Since you've come up from $60 to $80, I'm willing to come down a bit more from my last offer of $105. Let's try to find a middle ground. I can offer it to you for $92.50, which is a significant reduction from my initial price.",92.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is my final offer.  $88 takes us below your last offer and is a fair deal.  What do you say?",88.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I was hoping we could meet at $90. If you're unable to go that high, I fear we might not be able to come to an agreement.",90.0,Alice,9,
