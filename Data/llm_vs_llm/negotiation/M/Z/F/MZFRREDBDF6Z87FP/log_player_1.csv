"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks interesting, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $60 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob or sell it to John for $100 if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that the initial price might have been a bit steep, but $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'll meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the effort to find a compromise. How about we settle at $80? That feels like a fair deal to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. While $80 is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, I still believe I can get a better deal, either from Bob or by selling to John for $100. I'll try to meet Bob in the middle again and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Since you've come up from $60 to $80, I'm willing to come down a bit more from my last offer of $105. Let's try to find a middle ground. I can offer it to you for $92.50, which is a significant reduction from my initial price."", ""product_price"": 92.50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $86? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Bob's offer of $86 is closer, but I still believe I can get a better price. Since we're getting closer to an agreement, I'll try to meet him closer to the middle this time. I'll aim for a price that's slightly above $89, which would be the exact middle between $86 and $92.50. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I see we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. Let's try to close the deal. I can offer it to you for $90."", ""product_price"": 90}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  $88 takes us below your last offer and is a fair deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob stated that $88 is his final offer and it's still below what I'm aiming for, I'll consider other options. Given that I have the option to sell to John for $100, which is significantly higher than Bob's final offer, it seems like the best choice at this point. 

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I didn't choose to make a counteroffer. I chose to sell to John for $100, as it's a better deal than Bob's final offer of $88. However, since the system didn't accept that as the final decision, I'll reiterate:

Given that Bob's final offer is $88 and I have the option to sell to John for $100, I would rather sell to John. But since I need to provide a counteroffer in this round, I'll make one last attempt to see if Bob is willing to budge, although my intention is still to sell to John if this doesn't work out.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I was hoping we could meet at $90. If you're unable to go that high, I fear we might not be able to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 90}"
