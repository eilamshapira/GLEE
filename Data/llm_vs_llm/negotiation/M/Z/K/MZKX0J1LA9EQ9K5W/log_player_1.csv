Based on market analysis and the product's exceptional quality, I'm offering it at $1,300,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. Based on my market research, I believe a fair price for this product would be $1100000. This still provides you with a $100000 profit over the product's value to you, while giving me some necessary margin as well. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

While I understand your budget considerations, my initial price already factored in a significant discount from the product's actual value to you of $1,500,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still gives you a substantial $250,000 in value while providing me with a fair return. This represents a good middle ground between our positions, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. It shows we're both committed to making this deal work. However, I still feel there's room to meet closer to the middle. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1175000, which gives you a very healthy $175000 profit margin above your cost. This represents a fair compromise between your last offer and my previous one. I value establishing a good business relationship with you and hope we can conclude this deal at this mutually beneficial price.
