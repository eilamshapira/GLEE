"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $90, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to consider my options carefully:

1. Accept Alice's offer: Pay $90 for the product
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John for $80

Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and John is willing to sell it to me for exactly $80, I should choose the option that saves me the most money.

Alice's offer of $90 is $10 more than what I can get from John, and it exceeds my maximum valuation for the product.
