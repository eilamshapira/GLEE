"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I've got a great product I think you'd really like. I'm offering it to you for $250."", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $50. Can we meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, Bob's offer is far too low. I can't accept $50. My minimum acceptable price is $150, and I think I can get more than that.

Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, I'm willing to go down a bit from my original offer. How about $220?"", ""product_price"": 220}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down from $250, but $220 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new offer. How about $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Hmm, $135 is very close to my minimum, but it's still less than what I could get from John. I need to consider if I can get a better offer from Bob.

I'm getting close to the point where I'll just sell to John.

Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal. Given that you're close to my bottom line, I'm willing to come down a bit more. However, I need to make a reasonable profit. How about we settle on $200?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $200 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay a bit more than my previous offer, but I need to stay within my means. How about $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","This is a tough one. $160 is only slightly more than what I could get from John. I've spent a few rounds negotiating and could potentially get a higher price from Bob. However, I could also end up selling for less, and time is running out.

I think I will take the offer.

Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
