"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,500,000 (which is also John's price). It would be irrational to accept this offer when I can either get a better deal through negotiation or buy from John at $1,500,000. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'll start with a relatively low counteroffer of $1,000,000. This gives room for negotiation while being significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer of $2,000,000 and John's price of $1,500,000. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground that's below my maximum value of $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer is now equal to John's price ($1,500,000), and since this is my maximum value, there's no real advantage in continuing negotiations with Alice. Even if I make another counteroffer, Alice has shown she's unlikely to go significantly lower, as she's already dropped her price by $500,000. To avoid the risk of Alice raising her price again and to save time, I'll buy from John at $1,500,000."
