"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. How about we settle on $100 instead?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $140 might be a bit steep, but I think the product is worth more than $100. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to get a fair price for the product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your willingness to compromise, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $120 is still a bit high for me. Could we go down to $110? I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm trying to be flexible, but I still need to get a good price for the product. Considering your offer of $110 and my previous offer of $120, how about we settle at $115? I think this is a fair compromise, and it's the lowest I'm comfortable going.",115.0,Alice,5,
