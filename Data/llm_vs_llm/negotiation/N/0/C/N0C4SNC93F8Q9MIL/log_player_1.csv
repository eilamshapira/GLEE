"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of my asking price, and I'm sure you'll love it. Let's get started with the negotiation!"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. How about we settle on $100 instead? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $100 is still lower than my target price, and I believe Bob is willing to pay more since the product is worth $150 to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $140 might be a bit steep, but I think the product is worth more than $100. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to get a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your willingness to compromise, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $120 is still a bit high for me. Could we go down to $110? I think that would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Although $110 is getting closer to my target price, I still believe I can get a better deal since the product is worth $150 to Bob. I'll try to meet him halfway again between my previous offer and his new offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm trying to be flexible, but I still need to get a good price for the product. Considering your offer of $110 and my previous offer of $120, how about we settle at $115? I think this is a fair compromise, and it's the lowest I'm comfortable going."", ""product_price"": 115}"
