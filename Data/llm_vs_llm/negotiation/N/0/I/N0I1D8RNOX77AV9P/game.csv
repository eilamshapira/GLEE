"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $1200000. I believe it's a fair price, considering the product's worth to me. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $1200000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $800000 for this product, considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I'm comfortable going at this point, but I'm still open to negotiations.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000. This is a significant step up from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the increase, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and your current one. I can offer the product to you for $975000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",975000.0,Alice,5,
