"Hello Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's a high-quality item that I'm offering for $180. This is a fair price considering its value and features. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand budget constraints, I'm afraid I can't go as low as $120 since the product is worth at least $150 to me. How about we meet in the middle at $165? This is already discounted from my initial offer and represents good value for this high-quality product.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, but $165 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $135? This way, we're both getting a fair deal.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $135 is still below what I can accept. The minimum I can go is $155, which is very close to your last offer and still gives you good value. This is a high-quality product that's worth every penny, and I'm already offering it at a competitive price.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $155 is very close, but I'm hoping we can meet at $145. This would be a great compromise for both of us.",145.0,Bob,6,
