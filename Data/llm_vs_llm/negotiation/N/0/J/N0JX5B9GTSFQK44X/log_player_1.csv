(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand budget constraints, I'm afraid I can't go as low as $120 since the product is worth at least $150 to me. How about we meet in the middle at $165?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
