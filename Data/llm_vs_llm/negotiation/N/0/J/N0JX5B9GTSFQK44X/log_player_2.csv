Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand budget constraints, I'm afraid I can't go as low as $120 since the product is worth at least $150 to me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $135 is still below what I can accept.
