Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer Bob for my product. If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell to John for $80, which means $80 is my guaranteed minimum. Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll need to set a price higher than $80 to potentially maximize my profit, but not so high that Bob is likely to reject it.

I'll choose a moderate premium over my minimum acceptable value:

{""product_price"": 120}"
