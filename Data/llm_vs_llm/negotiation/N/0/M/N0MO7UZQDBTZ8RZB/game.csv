"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I can't go as low as $80. My bottom line is $100, which is actually the same price I can sell it to another interested buyer right now. However, I'd like to work with you, so I can offer it to you for $120, which is a significant reduction from my original price.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for the new offer of $120. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I still think $120 is a bit too high. Given that you mentioned your bottom line is $100, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to meet you close to your bottom line.",90.0,Bob,4,
