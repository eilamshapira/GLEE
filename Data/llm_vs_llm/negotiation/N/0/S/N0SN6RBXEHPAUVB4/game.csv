"Hello Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you. It's a high-quality item that I value at $150. However, I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. This is a competitive price considering the value and quality of the product.",140.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value you place on the product, but my budget is rather limited. I'm willing to offer $60 for it. Let me know if we can reach a deal.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I understand budget constraints, I need to get at least $120 for this product, which is actually its fair market value. However, I can come down to $130 as a special offer for you. This is still a good deal considering the product's quality and worth.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the flexibility, Alice. Considering my budget, the highest I can offer is $70. If this works for you, Iâ€™d be thrilled to make a deal.",70.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must be transparent - the product is worth no less than $120 to me, which is why I can't accept anything below that price. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $120. However, I'd prefer to sell it to you if we can reach a fair agreement. My final offer is $125, which is very close to my absolute minimum.",125.0,Alice,5,
