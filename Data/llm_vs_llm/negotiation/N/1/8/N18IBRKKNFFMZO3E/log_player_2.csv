"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's something I've been working on for a while, and I'm confident it can bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to consider my options carefully:

1. Alice is offering the product for $12,500
2. The product is worth up to $15,000 to me
3. I can buy from John for $15,000 if I reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer of $12,500 is below my maximum valuation of $15,000, which means I would get $2,500 in value by accepting her offer (the difference between what I'm willing to pay and what I actually pay).

If I reject Alice and buy from John for $15,000, I would pay exactly what the product is worth to me, leaving me with no surplus value.

The logical choice is to accept Alice's offer and save $2,500 compared to buying from John.
