"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer of $12,000 is below my maximum budget of $15,000, I'm inclined to consider it. However, I also want to see if I can negotiate a better price. Given that $12,000 is a significant amount, I'd like to try to negotiate downwards to save as much money as possible.

Therefore, my decision is to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the hopes of getting a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable, to see if we can meet in the middle.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. I believe the product's value is significant, and I'd be willing to offer it to you for $11000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down from her initial offer of $12,000 to $11,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming to save as much money as possible.

Since $11,000 is closer to my upper limit of $15,000 than my initial counteroffer of $9,000, I'll consider making another counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one but still lower than Alice's current offer.

My decision is to reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new counteroffer is: 
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
