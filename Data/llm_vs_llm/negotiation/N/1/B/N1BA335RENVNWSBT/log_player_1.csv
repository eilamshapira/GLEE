Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","I'll reject Bob's offer since it's below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 (and even below John's guaranteed offer). However, I'll continue negotiating with Bob since there's still potential to get a better price than John's $10,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let me make a counteroffer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $10,000, and we're only in round 4 (with 6 rounds remaining), I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer is now equal to John's guaranteed offer of $10,000, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation with Bob showing limited willingness to go much higher, I'll accept this offer. There's no advantage in continuing the negotiation or selling to John at this point since both options would yield the same amount.
