"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an exclusive product that I believe will be a great match for your needs. I’m offering it to you at $1500000. This is a unique opportunity—if you decide not to move forward, I'll be selling it to another buyer shortly. Let me know if you’re ready to make this exceptional deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum price.** This means you're not getting a discount and are essentially paying the same amount you'd pay John.
* **You have no information about the product's quality or if it's truly ""exclusive"".**  There's a risk that the product isn't worth the price, even though Alice claims it's a ""great match"".

By rejecting the offer, you can potentially negotiate a better price with John or find another seller altogether."
