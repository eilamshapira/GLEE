"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get a good price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $6,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $10,000, there's no reason to accept anything lower than that.
