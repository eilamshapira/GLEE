"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget. You should definitely reject and make a counter offer.  Buying from John right now is an option, but you can likely get a better price from Alice with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

This is a starting point.  It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that you're serious about getting a good deal."
