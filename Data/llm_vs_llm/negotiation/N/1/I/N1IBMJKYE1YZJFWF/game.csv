"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's quite a bit higher than what I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to pay $400000 for the product. How about we discuss this price?",400000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, after considering your offer, I'm willing to lower my price. How about we settle for $2000000? This is a fair price for the value you'll be getting from the product.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2000000 is still too high for me. I can offer $500000 for the product. What do you think about this price?",500000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I've reconsidered my previous offers and I'm willing to lower the price to $1700000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product more fairly while also considering your budget. What do you think about this new offer?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1700000 is still beyond what I'm willing to spend. I can offer $650000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some middle ground here.",650000.0,Bob,6,
