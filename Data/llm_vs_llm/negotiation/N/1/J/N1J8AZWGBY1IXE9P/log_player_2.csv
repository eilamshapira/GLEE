"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $150
2. John's fixed price is also $150
3. My maximum value for the product is $150

Since Alice's current offer ($150) equals my maximum value and equals John's price, there's no advantage in continuing negotiation. I can't get a better deal than $150 since that's my maximum value. Making a counteroffer would only prolong the process without any potential benefit.

Whether I accept Alice's offer or buy from John, I'll pay the same price. I might as well accept Alice's offer since we've already established contact.
