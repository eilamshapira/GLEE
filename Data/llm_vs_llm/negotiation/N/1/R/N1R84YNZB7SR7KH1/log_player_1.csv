Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth no less than $100 to me, and Bob's offer is exactly $100, I could consider accepting it. However, I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate, and I want to try to earn as much money as I can for the product.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $100, which is the minimum value I have for the product, I'll try to increase the price slightly to see if he's willing to pay more.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $110, I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my previous offer of $120. I'll offer $115, which is slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my previous offer.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer of $115 is getting closer to what I'm looking for. Since I only have 4 rounds left to negotiate, I'll think carefully about my next move. Accepting $115 would give me a decent profit, but I still want to try to get a bit more. However, the risk of losing the sale to John for $100 is increasing.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $115, and I rejected it, I'll try to make a small concession to show that I'm willing to negotiate. I'll offer $120 again, but this time, I'm open to accepting a slightly lower price if Bob is willing to meet me at $118 or $119. However, for now, I'll stick with $120.
