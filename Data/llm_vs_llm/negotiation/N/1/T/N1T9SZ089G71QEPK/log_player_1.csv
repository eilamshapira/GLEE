Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about a strategic first offer. Since the product is worth $80 to Bob and I can always sell it to John for $80, I should start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I make a profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since I can sell the product to John for $80, and the product is worth at least $80 to me, accepting Bob's offer of $60 would be a loss. There's no reason to accept an offer below what John is willing to pay.

Although I could continue negotiating with Bob, since Bob's initial offer is significantly below even John's price ($60 vs $80), it suggests Bob might not be willing to pay a price that would be better than John's guaranteed $80.

The safe and rational choice here is to sell to John.
