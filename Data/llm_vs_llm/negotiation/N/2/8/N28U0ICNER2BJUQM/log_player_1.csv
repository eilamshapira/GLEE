"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for the first round:

```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $1,200,000, and knowing my minimum acceptable price is also $1,200,000, I have a decision to make. I need to maximize my profit.

My options are:

*   **Accept Bob's Offer:** This guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price.
*   **Reject Bob's Offer and Counteroffer:** This risks further negotiation, potentially leading to a higher price but also the possibility of a lower price or no sale at all.
*   **Sell to John:** This guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price.

Since I am risk-averse, I will accept Bob's offer:

```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```"
