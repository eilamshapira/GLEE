"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Based on the information provided, Alice's offer is $200, which is more than the maximum value I'm willing to pay ($80). John is offering the same product for $80, which is exactly the maximum value I'm willing to pay.

Since Alice's price significantly exceeds my budget and John's offer is within my budget, I should buy from John.
