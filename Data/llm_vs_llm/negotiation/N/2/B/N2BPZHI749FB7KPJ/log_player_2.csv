"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120), it wouldn't be rational to accept this offer. Given that John's price is equal to my maximum value, I should try to negotiate with Alice first to see if I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably below John's price to leave room for negotiation while still being fair.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is quite high for me. I know this product is available elsewhere for much less. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after considering your perspective, I'm willing to lower my price. Would you be willing to pay $160 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $160 is still higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120). While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing the price, it's still not a good deal for me. I should continue negotiating since there's still potential to get a better price than John's $120.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still stay well below John's price to maintain room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $160 is still too high for me. I could go up to $110, which I think is a fair price for this product. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I want to find a middle ground here. I'm willing to lower my price to $140. Would that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's offer of $140 is still higher than John's price of $120, and since $120 is my maximum value for the product, it wouldn't make sense to pay more than that. While Alice is moving in the right direction with her offers, at this point I should continue negotiating. However, if we can't reach a deal below $120, I know I can always fall back on John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I can't go above $115 for this product. I know I can get it elsewhere for a similar price, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement."", ""product_price"": 115}"
