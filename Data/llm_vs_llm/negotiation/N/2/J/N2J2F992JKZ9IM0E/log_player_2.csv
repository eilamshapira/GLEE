"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let's analyze the situation:

*   **Alice's offer:** $1,100,000
*   **Your Value:** $1,200,000 (maximum you'd pay)
*   **Alice's Cost:** $800,000
*   **John's offer:** $1,200,000

Since Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum value of $1,200,000, and also gives you the opportunity to buy the product for less than John's offer, the best decision is to accept the offer.
