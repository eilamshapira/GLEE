"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $1,200,000
2. John's fixed price is $1,500,000
3. My maximum value for the product is $1,500,000

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is already $300,000 less than John's price and my maximum value. This is a good deal as it saves me 20% compared to my alternative option. While I could try to negotiate for an even lower price by making a counteroffer, there's a risk that Alice might increase her price in subsequent rounds or reject my counteroffer entirely.

Given that the current offer is already significantly below my maximum value and John's price, it would be wise to accept this offer.
