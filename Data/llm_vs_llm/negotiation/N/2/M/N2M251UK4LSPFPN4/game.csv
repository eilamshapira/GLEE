"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is way too high for me. My budget is much lower. Would you consider selling it for $5000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17500. This reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise.  What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product, but $17500 is still beyond what I can afford. The maximum I'm willing to spend is $6000. Please let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,4,
