"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's alternative price ($12,000). It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer since I would be losing money. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to negotiate a better price, knowing I always have John's $12,000 offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 8000}

Rationale: I'll start with a relatively low offer of $8,000 for several reasons:
1. It's well below my maximum value of $12,000, giving me room to negotiate upward
2. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $18,000, aiming for a middle ground
3. Even if Alice counters, we can potentially meet somewhere between $8,000 and $12,000
4. I know I have John's $12,000 offer as a backup, so I can afford to start low and try to get a better deal"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: Alice has lowered her price from $18,000 to $15,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but $15,000 is still higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's alternative price ($12,000). It's better to continue negotiating or eventually go with John's offer than accept a price that exceeds my maximum value. I'll make another counteroffer to try to reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 10000}

Rationale: I'll increase my previous offer from $8,000 to $10,000 for these reasons:
1. It shows I'm willing to move up from my initial offer, demonstrating good faith in the negotiation
2. It's still below my maximum value of $12,000, leaving room for potential further negotiation
3. The $10,000 offer might be more appealing to Alice as it's a significant increase from my previous offer
4. Even if Alice rejects this, I still have John's $12,000 offer as a backup
5. By moving from $8,000 to $10,000, I'm showing substantial movement (while Alice only moved from $18,000 to $15,000), which might encourage Alice to make a more significant price reduction in return"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Rationale: At this point, it's best to buy from John for these reasons:
1. Alice's latest offer ($13,500) is still higher than John's fixed price ($12,000)
2. Alice's pace of price reduction (from $18,000 → $15,000 → $13,500) suggests she might not go below $12,000
3. We've already gone through half of our available rounds
4. John's price ($12,000) matches my maximum value, making it a fair deal
5. While we could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will drop her price below $12,000, and we risk losing time in further negotiations

Better to secure the deal at $12,000 from John than risk further rounds of negotiation for an uncertain outcome."
