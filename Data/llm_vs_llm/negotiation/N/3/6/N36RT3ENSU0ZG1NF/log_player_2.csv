"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice is trying to sell the product to me for $150, which is higher than what it's worth to me (no more than $120). Since John is willing to sell the identical product for $120, which matches my maximum valuation, it makes no sense to accept Alice's offer of $150.

I could reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate, but since I already have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $120, and Alice's cost is also $120, there's little room for Alice to offer me a better deal than John.
