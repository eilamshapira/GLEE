"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'll reject Alice's offer of $110 because it's higher than my maximum value of $80 and also higher than John's price of $80. Since I can always buy from John for $80, there's no reason to accept a price higher than that.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $100 to Alice and I want to save as much money as possible while still making it worthwhile for Alice to sell, I'll start with a relatively low but reasonable offer.

{""product_price"": 70}

This offer gives Alice room to negotiate up while still keeping me under my maximum of $80. If Alice rejects this, we can potentially meet somewhere in the middle, but I always have the option to go to John for $80 if Alice won't come down enough."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'll reject Alice's offer of $90 because it's still higher than John's price of $80. Since I can get the product for $80 from John, there's no reason to pay more than that. Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but she needs to beat (or at least match) John's price for me to consider buying from her.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by coming down to $90, I'll increase my previous offer slightly but still keep it below John's price to try to reach a deal that's better for me than John's offer.

{""product_price"": 75}

This offer gives Alice a better price than my previous offer of $70, while still giving me a better deal than John's $80. If Alice doesn't accept this, I can always go to John, so there's no reason for me to offer more than $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer of $85 is still higher than John's price of $80, and I have no reason to pay more than $80 (which I can get from John at any time), I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has come down to $85 and we've been negotiating for several rounds, I'll make one final reasonable offer. If she doesn't accept this, it might be best to just go with John's offer.

{""product_price"": 78}

This offer is very close to John's price of $80, giving Alice a chance to make the sale while still saving me a small amount compared to John's offer. If Alice doesn't accept this, I'll likely choose to buy from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer of $82 is still higher than John's price of $80, and we've been negotiating for several rounds without reaching a price better than John's, it's time to end the negotiation and buy from John. There's no reason to continue negotiating or to pay more than $80 when I have a guaranteed option at that price.
