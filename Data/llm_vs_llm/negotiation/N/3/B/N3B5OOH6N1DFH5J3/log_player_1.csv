"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob and I want to earn as much money as I can, I'll start by offering a high price. However, I don't want to scare Bob away, so I'll offer a price that's slightly lower than what I think he's willing to pay.

{""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $11,000 is higher than my minimum price of $8,000, but lower than what I was hoping to get, I'll choose to reject his offer and make a counteroffer. I still think I can get a better price from Bob, so I'll try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob offered $11,000, I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my initial offer of $14,000. I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.

{""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's new offer of $11,500 is getting closer to what I'm looking for, but I still think I can get a better price. Since he's willing to increase his offer, I'll try to negotiate further. I'll reject his offer again and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer of $11,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get, I'll try to split the difference again. My previous counteroffer was $13,000, so I'll lower it slightly to $12,500. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it's a compromise.

{""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's new offer of $12,000 is getting very close to my counteroffer of $12,500. At this point, I think it's a good idea to consider accepting his offer, as it's still a good price and we're running out of rounds to negotiate. However, I'll try to squeeze out a bit more value by making one more counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $12,500, I'll try to meet him in the middle. I'll make a counteroffer of $12,250, which is just $250 above Bob's offer. This is a small concession, and I hope it will be enough to close the deal.

{""product_price"": 12250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's new offer of $12,100 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $12,250. At this point, I think it's a good idea to accept his offer, as it's a good price and we're running out of rounds to negotiate. Rejecting his offer again might risk him walking away, and selling to John for $8,000 is not a good option compared to Bob's offer.
