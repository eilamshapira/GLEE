"Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. It's a high-quality item that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm initially pricing it at what I believe is a fair market value. Let me know what you think.",250.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $250 is way above my budget and what I believe is a fair price for this product. I can get a similar product from another seller for $120. I would like to offer $90 for your product, which I think is a reasonable starting point for our negotiation.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate you starting the negotiation, $90 is lower than what I'm willing to accept. I understand you can find something similar elsewhere, but the quality and features of my product justify a higher price. How about we meet in the middle a bit? I can offer it to you for $220.",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $220 is still significantly higher than what I can pay. As I mentioned, I can get the product for $120 from another seller. To make this work, I can offer $100, which gives you a better deal than my previous offer while still being within my budget.",100.0,Bob,4,
