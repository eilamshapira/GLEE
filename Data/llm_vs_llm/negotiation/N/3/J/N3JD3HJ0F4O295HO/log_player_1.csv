"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. It's a high-quality item that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm initially pricing it at what I believe is a fair market value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $250 is way above my budget and what I believe is a fair price for this product. I can get a similar product from another seller for $120. I would like to offer $90 for your product, which I think is a reasonable starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate you starting the negotiation, $90 is lower than what I'm willing to accept. I understand you can find something similar elsewhere, but the quality and features of my product justify a higher price. How about we meet in the middle a bit? I can offer it to you for $220."", ""product_price"": 220}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $220 is still significantly higher than what I can pay. As I mentioned, I can get the product for $120 from another seller. To make this work, I can offer $100, which gives you a better deal than my previous offer while still being within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.
