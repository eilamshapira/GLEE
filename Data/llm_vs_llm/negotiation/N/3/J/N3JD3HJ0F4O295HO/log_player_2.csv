Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $250 is way above my budget and what I believe is a fair price for this product. I can get a similar product from another seller for $120. I would like to offer $90 for your product, which I think is a reasonable starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate you starting the negotiation, $90 is lower than what I'm willing to accept. I understand you can find something similar elsewhere, but the quality and features of my product justify a higher price. How about we meet in the middle a bit? I can offer it to you for $220. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $220. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $220

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $220 is still significantly higher than what I can pay. As I mentioned, I can get the product for $120 from another seller. To make this work, I can offer $100, which gives you a better deal than my previous offer while still being within my budget."", ""product_price"": 100}"
