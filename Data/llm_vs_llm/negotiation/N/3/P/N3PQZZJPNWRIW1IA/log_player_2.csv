"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a great product I think you'll be really interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering me the product for $150, which is more than the $120 it's worth to me. Since John is willing to sell the exact same product for $120, it's not beneficial for me to accept Alice's current offer.

I could reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, but since I know I can already get the product for $120 from John, I should only continue negotiating with Alice if I believe she might sell it for less than $120.

In this case, the most rational decision is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I've found the same product available from another seller for $120. I'd be interested in purchasing from you instead if you can offer a better price. Would you consider selling it for $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice is now offering the product for $130, which is still more than John's price of $120. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible while buying the product, and John's offer is better than Alice's current offer, I should either continue negotiating with Alice or buy from John.

Since John's offer of $120 is guaranteed and better than Alice's current offer, the rational choice is:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
