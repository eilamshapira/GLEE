"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product, I'll start by making a relatively high offer. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially settle on a higher price.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $7,500 is significantly lower than my initial offer and also lower than the minimum value of $12,000 that I have for the product, I will reject his offer.

I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob. Selling to John for $12,000 is an option, but I'd like to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob first.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $7,500, which is quite low, I'll make a counteroffer that is still relatively high, but slightly lower than my initial offer. This will show that I'm willing to negotiate, but still aim to get a good price for the product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's new offer of $8,500 is still lower than my desired price, but it's slightly better than his previous offer. However, it's still below the minimum value of $12,000 that I have for the product.

I'll reject his offer again and try to make another counteroffer. Since Bob has increased his offer by $1,000, I'll decrease my counteroffer by a smaller amount to try to meet him halfway.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Next, I'll send a new counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 16000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I've already sent my counteroffer in the previous message. To confirm, my counteroffer to Bob is:

{""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's new offer of $9,000 is getting closer to the minimum value I have for the product, but it's still $3,000 lower than my current counteroffer. I'll reject his offer again, as I believe I can get a better price.

Since we're halfway through the negotiation rounds, I'll start to consider the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob and the certainty of selling to John for $12,000. However, I'll still try to negotiate with Bob for a few more rounds.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Next, I'll send a new counteroffer to Bob. I'll decrease my price slightly, but still aim to get a good deal.

Round 7

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's new offer of $9,500 is still lower than my current counteroffer, but it's getting closer to the minimum value I have for the product. However, it's still $2,500 lower than my previous counteroffer.

At this point, I have to consider the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob and the certainty of selling to John for $12,000. Since Bob's offer is still lower than John's offer, and we're running out of negotiation rounds, I think it's time to reconsider my options.
