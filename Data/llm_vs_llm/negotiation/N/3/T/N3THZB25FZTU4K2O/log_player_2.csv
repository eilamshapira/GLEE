"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice's offer of $20,000 is well above my maximum value of $10,000, so accepting it would be a poor decision. I also have the option to buy from John for $10,000, which is exactly my maximum value. However, I should try negotiating with Alice first to see if I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice that's significantly below her initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her price from $20,000 to $18,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $18,000 is still well above my maximum value of $10,000 and above John's price of $10,000. Since Alice came down by $2,000, I should continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price than John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice lowered her price by $2,000, I'll continue negotiating but make a more significant move toward a middle ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her price again to $16,000, showing she's willing to continue negotiating. However, this is still well above my maximum value of $10,000 and above John's price. Since Alice has now dropped her price twice (from $20,000 to $18,000 to $16,000), I should continue negotiating to see if I can get her below John's $10,000 offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has been consistently dropping her price by $2,000 each round, I'll continue to increase my offer, but at a slower rate to try to meet at a favorable price point.

{""product_price"": $9,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice continues to lower her price, now to $14,000. She's consistently dropping by $2,000 each round. At this rate, she might reach $10,000 or below in two more rounds. However, I still have John's guaranteed offer of $10,000, which is at my maximum value threshold. Since Alice's current offer is still above John's price, and I want to save as much money as possible, the best decision is to continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has consistently been dropping her price by $2,000 each round, I'll continue increasing my offer gradually to try to meet at a favorable point below John's $10,000 offer.
