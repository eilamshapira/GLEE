"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, $60 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $200? I am confident you will find it worth the investment.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $200 is still much higher than what I'm looking to spend. I could go up to $70, but that's my absolute limit.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget. However, I cannot sell it for $70. Let's try $180. It is a significant discount and I think it reflects a fair compromise.",180.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the effort to find a compromise, but that price is still too high for me. To be completely honest, I have a budget of $80. I'm willing to go up to $75 as my final offer.  If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options.",75.0,Bob,6,
