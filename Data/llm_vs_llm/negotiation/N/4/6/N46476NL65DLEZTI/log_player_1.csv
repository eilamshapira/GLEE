Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Considering my goal is to earn as much as possible, and the product is worth at least $80 to me:

I will **RejectOffer** and make a counteroffer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking $100 would be a fair price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, I'll evaluate my options again. I can:

*   Accept $100 from Bob.
*   Reject and counteroffer.
*   Sell to John for $80.

Given my minimum value of $80 and Bob's current offer of $100, I'd prefer to get more money. I'll risk rejecting Bob's offer and make a new counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, here's my counteroffer:
