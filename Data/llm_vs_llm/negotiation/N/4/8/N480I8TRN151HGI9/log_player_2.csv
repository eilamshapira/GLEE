"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $190. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $190. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $190
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer because $190 is way above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). It would make sense to either make a counteroffer closer to my valuation or buy from John, but $190 is not acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $190 is too high for me. I can get this product elsewhere for $80. I would be willing to pay $70 for your product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 70}

I'm making a strategic low offer of $70, which is below my maximum value of $80. This gives room for negotiation while keeping in mind that I always have the option to buy from John at $80. Since Alice's product is worth $150 to her, there might be room for negotiation between my offer and her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, $70 is too low for me. How about $185? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $185. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $185
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll buy from John because:
1. Alice's new offer of $185 is still way above my maximum value of $80
2. Alice only reduced her price by $5 from $190 to $185, suggesting she's not willing to negotiate down to a price near my valuation
3. John's price of $80 exactly matches my maximum value
4. Continuing negotiations with Alice seems unlikely to result in a better deal than John's offer

It's more efficient to take John's guaranteed offer of $80 rather than continue negotiations that don't seem promising."
