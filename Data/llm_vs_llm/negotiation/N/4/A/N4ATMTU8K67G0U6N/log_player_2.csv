# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll find our asking price of $1250000 quite reasonable.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,000,000, I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and within my budget. Since I know that Alice is willing to sell the product and I'm interested in buying it, I'll offer a price that is closer to my maximum budget.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I would like to make you a counteroffer. I am willing to go down from my initial asking price and meet you at $1100000. I'm sure you can appreciate the value and the benefits that come with acquiring such a high quality product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's a better offer than the initial one, I'm not willing to pay more than $1,000,000 for the product. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, I'll reject Alice's offer and consider my next move.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer, trying to meet Alice halfway. Since Alice's last offer was $1,100,000 and I'm willing to pay up to $1,000,000, I'll offer a price that's slightly higher than my previous offer, but still within my budget.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm really wanting to make this deal work for both of us. After reevaluating our pricing model and taking into account the product's intrinsic value and the long-term benefits, I'm willing to make you an offer of $1025000. I believe this price point is more reasonable for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,025,000 is still slightly above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. However, I can see that she's making an effort to meet me halfway and find a mutually beneficial price. Since I'm getting closer to my budget limit, I'll consider my options carefully.

At this point, I have to weigh the benefits of negotiating further with Alice against the certainty of buying the product from John for $1,000,000. Given that Alice's offer is only $25,000 above my budget, I'll reject her offer and try to make one final counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one, trying to meet Alice as close to her offer as possible while still being within my budget.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer $1000000, which is the highest price I'm comfortable paying for the product. I believe this price is fair and reflects the product's value. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider alternative options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
