Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider the optimal pricing strategy for my product.

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and I have a guaranteed fallback option of selling to John for $800,000.

Since Bob knows I have this alternative, he won't accept an offer that's too close to $1,200,000. However, I should aim for a price that gives us both some value from the transaction.

A fair approach would be to split the surplus value ($400,000) somewhat in Bob's favor to incentivize him to accept, while still significantly improving my position compared to my fallback option.
