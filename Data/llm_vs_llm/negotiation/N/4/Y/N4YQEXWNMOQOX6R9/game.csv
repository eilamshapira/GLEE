"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $900000 is significantly below what I consider a fair price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? This would still be a great deal for you considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
