"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its value to you, I'm prepared to offer it to you for the price of: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to consider my options carefully here:

1. Alice is offering the product for $1,250,000
2. John is selling the same product for $1,500,000
3. The product is worth at most $1,500,000 to me

Alice's offer is $250,000 cheaper than John's price, and it's below my maximum valuation. I want to save as much money as possible while still acquiring the product I need.
