"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but the price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $9000 is below my minimum acceptable price for this product. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $13000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. However, $13000 is still a bit out of my budget. I can stretch to $9500. Let me know if that's something you can work with.",9500.0,Bob,4,
