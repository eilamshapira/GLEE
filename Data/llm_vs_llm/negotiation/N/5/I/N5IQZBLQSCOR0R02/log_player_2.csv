Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $9000 is below my minimum acceptable price for this product. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $13000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.
