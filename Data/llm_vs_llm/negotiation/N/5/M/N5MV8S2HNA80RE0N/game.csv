"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $25000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but my budget is more limited. I am willing to offer $6000 for it. Let me know if we can work together on this.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I must inform you that $6000 is significantly below the product's market value. While I understand budget constraints, I have other interested buyers willing to pay much more. However, I'm willing to work with you and can reduce my initial asking price to $22000. This is still a competitive price given the product's quality and value.",22000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand the product has great quality, but I truly have to work within my budget. I'm able to go up to $7500. I hope we can find a middle ground.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but I need to be transparent with you. I have a standing offer of $15000 from another buyer, so I cannot accept anything below that amount. However, I believe my product offers superior value, and I'm willing to offer it to you at $19000, which is a significant reduction from my previous asks. If we cannot find common ground near this price point, I will need to pursue other options.",19000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I truly appreciate you working with me and providing an insight into your other offers. I understand the value of your product, but the maximum I can offer is $9000. I hope this can work for us both, as I would be very interested in purchasing.",9000.0,Bob,6,
