"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $25,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but my budget is more limited. I am willing to offer $6000 for it. Let me know if we can work together on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. His low offer suggests he might be trying to anchor the negotiation at a very low price point, but since I have John's guaranteed offer of $15,000, I can confidently negotiate for a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I must inform you that $6,000 is significantly below the product's market value. While I understand budget constraints, I have other interested buyers willing to pay much more. However, I'm willing to work with you and can reduce my initial asking price to $22,000. This is still a competitive price given the product's quality and value."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand the product has great quality, but I truly have to work within my budget. I'm able to go up to $7500. I hope we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's new offer of $7,500 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and his small increase from $6,000 to $7,500 suggests he's not likely to reach a price point that would be better than John's guaranteed offer. However, I'll make one more attempt with a lower counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap. If Bob's next offer doesn't show significant movement upward, I will likely take John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but I need to be transparent with you. I have a standing offer of $15,000 from another buyer, so I cannot accept anything below that amount. However, I believe my product offers superior value, and I'm willing to offer it to you at $19,000, which is a significant reduction from my previous asks. If we cannot find common ground near this price point, I will need to pursue other options."", ""product_price"": 19000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I truly appreciate you working with me and providing an insight into your other offers. I understand the value of your product, but the maximum I can offer is $9000. I hope this can work for us both, as I would be very interested in purchasing. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offers have consistently remained well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even after I disclosed having a $15,000 offer, he still came back with just $9,000. His incremental increases ($6,000 → $7,500 → $9,000) suggest he's not likely to reach $15,000 or above. Given we've already gone through 6 rounds and the gap is still substantial, it's best to accept John's guaranteed offer of $15,000 rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to yield a better result."
