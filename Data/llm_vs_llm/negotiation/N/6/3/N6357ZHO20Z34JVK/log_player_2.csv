"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $12,000
2. My maximum value for the product is $15,000
3. John's fixed price is $15,000
4. I can counter-offer if I reject

Alice's offer of $12,000 is $3,000 less than my maximum value and John's price. While I could try to negotiate for an even lower price by making a counteroffer, $12,000 is already a reasonable price that gives me good savings. There's also a risk that if I reject and make a counteroffer, the negotiation might break down or Alice might increase her price.

Given these factors, I should accept Alice's current offer of $12,000. It's a good deal that saves me $3,000 compared to buying from John.
