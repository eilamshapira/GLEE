"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but 5000000 is out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I believe the product is valuable, but I don't think it's worth that much to me. I'm willing to pay a significant amount, but I need to stay within my means.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $5000000 may be out of your budget, but I still believe the product has immense value. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I've considered your offer of $750000, and I'm making a significant concession. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",3000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and making a concession, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, 3000000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I believe this product has value, but I need to stay within my budget.",1875000.0,Bob,4,
