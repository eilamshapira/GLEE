Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but 5000000 is out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I believe the product is valuable, but I don't think it's worth that much to me. I'm willing to pay a significant amount, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $750,000 because it's significantly lower than my initial offer and I believe the product is worth more. I'd like to make a counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle. My next offer will be $3,000,000."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer and making a concession, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, 3000000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I believe this product has value, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I accept Bob's offer of $1,875,000. Although it's still lower than my initial price, it's a significant improvement from his previous offers, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Additionally, it's higher than the $1,000,000 I could get from selling to John, so I'm willing to accept this offer and conclude the negotiation. {""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
