"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $8000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need a much better price. Would you consider $6000? This would allow you to make a sale today and save me from having to go to another seller.",6000.0,Bob,2,
