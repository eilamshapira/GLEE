"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and worth."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $8000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need a much better price. Would you consider $6000? This would allow you to make a sale today and save me from having to go to another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Reasoning: Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Additionally, Bob has revealed that the product is only worth $8,000 to him, which means even with further negotiation, we won't be able to reach a price that would be profitable for me (above $12,000). Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $12,000, it makes the most economic sense to sell to John rather than continue negotiations with Bob. This ensures I get my minimum acceptable price without wasting more time in negotiations that are unlikely to be successful."
