"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is significantly above both my maximum value ($8,000) and even higher than what the product is worth to Alice ($12,000). This is not a reasonable starting point, and there's no reason for me to accept this offer when I have the option to buy from John for $8,000.

However, before immediately going to John, I should try negotiating with Alice since the product is worth $12,000 to her, and there might be room to negotiate a price lower than $8,000, which would be better for me.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $8,000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need a much better price. Would you consider $6,000? This would allow you to make a sale today and save me from having to go to another seller."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
