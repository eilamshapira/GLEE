Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 120}

The rationale for this offer is:
1. I know the product is worth exactly $120 to Bob
2. I can guarantee selling it to John for $120
3. Given these conditions, there's no reason to offer a lower price
4. If Bob accepts, I get $120, if he rejects, I still get $120 from John
5. This maximizes my profit while matching Bob's maximum willingness to pay"
