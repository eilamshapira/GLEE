"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14000.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $14000 is above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $8000, considering the product's value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $11500? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9000, which is closer to my maximum budget for this product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9000 is still quite a distance from what I had in mind.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at $10000.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
