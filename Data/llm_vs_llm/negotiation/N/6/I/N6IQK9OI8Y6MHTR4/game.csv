"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me at this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $8000 is the absolute minimum value of this product to me, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Given the product's quality and market value, I can come down to $10500, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This is still a great value considering what the product offers. Would this work for you?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $10500. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $9250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
