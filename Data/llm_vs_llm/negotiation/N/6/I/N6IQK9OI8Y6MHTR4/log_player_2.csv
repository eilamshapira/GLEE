Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $8000 is the absolute minimum value of this product to me, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Given the product's quality and market value, I can come down to $10500, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This is still a great value considering what the product offers. Would this work for you?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
