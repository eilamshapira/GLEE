"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given that Alice's offer is $1,200,000 and the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, I should not accept her offer as it exceeds my maximum valuation. I also have the guaranteed option to buy from John for $1,000,000, which is my maximum valuation.

However, before going to John, it makes sense to try negotiating with Alice first to potentially get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than both Alice's initial price and John's alternative, giving room for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has reduced her price to $1,050,000, which is still above John's price of $1,000,000. Since John's offer is still better and within my maximum valuation, I should either negotiate further with Alice or go with John's offer.

Since I still have 7 more potential rounds of negotiation and Alice has already moved significantly from her initial price, it's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if we can get below John's price.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has now offered the same price as John - $1,000,000. Since both options now cost the same, and this price is exactly at my maximum valuation, I could accept either one. However, since I still have 5 more potential rounds of negotiation and Alice has been willing to decrease her price in each round, it makes sense to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get an even better deal.

Round 6

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has now offered $975,000, which is better than John's price of $1,000,000. This is $25,000 less than my maximum valuation and John's price. Since Alice has continued to decrease her price and is now offering a better deal than John, I should accept this offer.
