"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1500000. Let me know if you're interestedâ€”if not, I'll be finalizing the sale with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $1,500,000, it would not be rational to accept her offer. Additionally, I have a guaranteed option to buy the same product from John for $1,000,000, which is within my value range.

Therefore, I should buy from John to save $500,000.
