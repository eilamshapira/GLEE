Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 150}

Rationale: Since I know that:
1. The product is worth $150 minimum to me
2. The product is only worth $80 to Bob
3. I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $150
4. Bob will reject any price above $80

There's no reason for me to offer the product to Bob at any price below $150. Even if Bob rejects the offer (which he will), I can sell to John for $150. Offering a lower price would only result in less profit for me."
