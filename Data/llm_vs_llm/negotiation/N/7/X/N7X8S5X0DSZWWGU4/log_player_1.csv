Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that the product is worth $10,000 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should start with a higher price when negotiating with Bob. This gives room for potential negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum acceptable price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, it would not be rational to accept Bob's offer. Given that Bob's maximum value for the product is $8,000, there's no possibility of reaching a deal that would be better than John's offer.
