"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $10800. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth up to $12,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $10,800
3. John's price is $12,000
4. Alice's cost is $8,000

Alice's offer at $10,800 is $1,200 less than John's price ($12,000), so I would save money by accepting Alice's offer. While Alice is making a good profit ($2,800 above her cost), I'm still getting a better deal than buying from John.

Since the goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, I should accept Alice's offer.
