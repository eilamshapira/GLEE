"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","In this situation, all options lead to paying $120 for the product:
1. Accepting Alice's offer: Pay $120
2. Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John: Pay $120
3. Buying from John directly: Pay $120

Since there's no price advantage in any option, and Alice has already made the offer, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer to maintain a good business relationship.
