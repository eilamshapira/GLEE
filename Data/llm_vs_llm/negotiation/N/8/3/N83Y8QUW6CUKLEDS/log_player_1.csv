"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture most of the potential surplus.  I'm leaving some room for negotiation, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a significant price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I'm not ready to give up just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my ideal value. I believe this is a fair compromise, given that Bob is willing to pay $13,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price,  $13,500 is a good deal and significantly better than selling to John.  There's a risk that I could get a slightly better offer in the future rounds, but it's not worth the risk of losing a sale altogether."
