Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer that I believe is more reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $900,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. My counteroffer will be $2,200,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your new offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think the price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer that I believe is closer to the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as $1,100,000 is still below my desired price. However, I'll try to meet him halfway. My counteroffer will be $1,800,000, and I'm open to further negotiation if needed, but I also have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I won't go below that. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. My next counteroffer is $1,800,000. I'm hoping this brings us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your new offer. I appreciate the effort you're putting into finding a mutually beneficial price. However, I still think the price is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Considering John's offer of $1200000, I'd like to make a counteroffer that's slightly higher, in the hopes of reaching an agreement with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is lower than John's offer of $1,500,000, it makes more sense to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, as it is a higher price and guarantees a sale."
