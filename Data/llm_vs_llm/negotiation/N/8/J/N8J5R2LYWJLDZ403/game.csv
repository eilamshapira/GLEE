"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be interested in buying if you were willing to come down to $80.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not comfortable selling it for $80. I believe it's worth more than that. I'm willing to compromise and lower the price to $140. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really only interested in the product if the price is closer to $80.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
