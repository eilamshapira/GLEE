"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know I can get the product for $150 from John and that's my maximum value for the product, I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice that's below that price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $250 to $230, she's showing some flexibility. However, since I can still get it for $150 from John, I'll make a slightly higher offer than my previous one but still well below John's price.

Since Alice keeps lowering her price but is still above John's price of $150, and we have several rounds left, it's worth continuing to negotiate to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has been gradually reducing her price ($250 -> $230 -> $210), showing she's willing to negotiate. I'll increase my offer slightly from my last bid of $120, but still keep it well below John's price of $150.
