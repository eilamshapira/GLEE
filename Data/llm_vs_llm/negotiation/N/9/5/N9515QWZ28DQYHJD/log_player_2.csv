"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me think through this:

1. The product is worth up to $12,000 to me
2. John's fixed price is $12,000
3. Alice's offer is $11,000
4. The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation

Alice's offer of $11,000 is lower than John's price ($12,000), but still seems high considering the product is worth $8,000 to her. Since there's still room for negotiation, and I can always fall back on John's offer, I should try to negotiate a better price with Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice and $12,000 to me, I'll try to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me. Alice started high at $11,000, so I'll start relatively low but still above her cost to show I'm serious about negotiating.

I'll offer $9,000, which gives Alice a $1,000 profit margin while still saving me $3,000 compared to John's price. This leaves room for negotiation if Alice counters.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has moved down from $11,000 to $10,500, showing willingness to negotiate
2. The gap between our positions ($9,000 vs $10,500) has decreased
3. $10,500 is still better than John's $12,000 price
4. There might still be room for negotiation since Alice's cost is $8,000

However, Alice's $500 reduction suggests she might not be willing to move much lower. While I could try another counteroffer, there's a risk of her becoming less flexible or returning to a higher price. $10,500 represents a $1,500 saving compared to John's price, which is a decent outcome.
