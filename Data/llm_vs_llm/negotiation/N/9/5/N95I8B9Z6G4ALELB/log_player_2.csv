"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll find our asking price of $1450000 quite reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $1,450,000, I need to consider my options carefully.

The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, so Alice's offer of $1,450,000 would mean I'm paying $250,000 more than the product's value to me.

John is willing to sell me the same product for $1,200,000, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me. This would be a fair transaction where I don't overpay.

Since Alice's initial offer is significantly above both my valuation and John's alternative price, the best decision is to buy from John.
