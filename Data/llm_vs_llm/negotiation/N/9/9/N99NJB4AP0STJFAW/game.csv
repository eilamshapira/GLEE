"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $250. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable.",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $250 is far too high for me. This product is only worth about $100 to me, which is what another seller (John) is offering. I'd like to offer you $70 for it. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go through the trouble of dealing with another seller.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $70 is too low for me. I can't go below $200 as that is the least I can get from another buyer. Let's meet halfway at $175, and you'll have yourself a deal.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $175 is still well above what I can justify spending. The product is only worth $100 to me maximum, which is exactly what John is offering. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I need a better price. I can offer you $85. This saves me some money while still giving you a sale that you might not get elsewhere.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're still quite far apart on the price. I want to work with you, but I can't go below $150 as that is what I can get from John.  I'm willing to go as low as $155 to make this happen. I'm sure you can understand that I want a bit more than the minimum I can get.",155.0,Alice,5,
