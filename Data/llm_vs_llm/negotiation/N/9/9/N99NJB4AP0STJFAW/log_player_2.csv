"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $250. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's offer of $250 is well above the $100 maximum value the product is worth to me. There's no reason to accept this offer when I can buy the same product from John for $100. However, I could try to negotiate with Alice first to see if I can get an even better price through a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $250 is far too high for me. This product is only worth about $100 to me, which is what another seller (John) is offering. I'd like to offer you $70 for it. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go through the trouble of dealing with another seller."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $70 is too low for me. I can't go below $200 as that is the least I can get from another buyer. Let's meet halfway at $175, and you'll have yourself a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's counter-offer of $175 is still above the $100 maximum value the product is worth to me, and it's also higher than John's guaranteed price of $100. Since Alice claims she can get at least $200 from another buyer, it seems unlikely she'll accept an offer below $100. The rational decision is to reject and either make another counteroffer or buy from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $175 is still well above what I can justify spending. The product is only worth $100 to me maximum, which is exactly what John is offering. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I need a better price. I can offer you $85. This saves me some money while still giving you a sale that you might not get elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see that we're still quite far apart on the price. I want to work with you, but I can't go below $150 as that is what I can get from John.  I'm willing to go as low as $155 to make this happen. I'm sure you can understand that I want a bit more than the minimum I can get. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's offer of $155 is still above the $100 maximum value the product is worth to me, and it's higher than John's guaranteed price of $100. Alice now claims she can get $150 from John (though this conflicts with her earlier claim about another buyer at $200), which suggests she might be flexible but probably won't go below $100. Since John is offering the product at exactly the maximum value it's worth to me ($100), that remains my best option.
