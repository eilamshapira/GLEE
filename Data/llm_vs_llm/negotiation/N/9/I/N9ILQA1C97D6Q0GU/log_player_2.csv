"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The offer of $2,500,000 is significantly higher than the maximum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me. Since John is offering the product at exactly $800,000, which is my maximum value, it makes more sense to buy from John rather than continue negotiating with Alice, whose initial offer is more than three times my maximum value."
