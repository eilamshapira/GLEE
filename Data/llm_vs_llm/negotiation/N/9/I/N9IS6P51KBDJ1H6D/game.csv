"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product quality you've mentioned, $180 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I would be comfortable paying $90 for this product. I'd love to do business with you if we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer and for sharing your market research and budget constraints. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I must admit that $90 is below the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a concession and lower the price, but I need to meet my minimum requirements. I'd like to offer you the product for $150.",150.0,Alice,3,
