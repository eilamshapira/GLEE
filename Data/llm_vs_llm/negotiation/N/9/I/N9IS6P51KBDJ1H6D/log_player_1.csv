"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its exceptional quality and value, I'm starting with a competitive price. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product quality you've mentioned, $180 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I would be comfortable paying $90 for this product. I'd love to do business with you if we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $90 is below the minimum value of the product to me ($120), accepting it would result in a loss. Selling to John for $120 is an option, but I'd like to try to negotiate with Bob further to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price above $120. 

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer and for sharing your market research and budget constraints. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I must admit that $90 is below the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a concession and lower the price, but I need to meet my minimum requirements. I'd like to offer you the product for $150."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.
