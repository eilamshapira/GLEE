"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its exceptional quality and value, I'm starting with a competitive price. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Considering Alice's offer of $180, it's not a good deal for me since it exceeds the $120 value limit I have for this product. John is offering the same product for $120, which matches my maximum value. However, I could try negotiating with Alice to get an even better price before resorting to John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product quality you've mentioned, $180 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I would be comfortable paying $90 for this product. I'd love to do business with you if we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer and for sharing your market research and budget constraints. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I must admit that $90 is below the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a concession and lower the price, but I need to meet my minimum requirements. I'd like to offer you the product for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Considering Alice's revised offer of $150, it's still above the $120 maximum value for me. I note that John is offering the product for $120, which is the upper limit of what I'm willing to pay. While I could continue negotiating with Alice, her current price is still quite high compared to my earlier offer of $90, suggesting we might have trouble meeting in the middle at a price that works for me.
