"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I notice that Alice's offer is $1,200,000, which exceeds the maximum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me. Since John is offering the same product for $1,000,000, which is equal to my maximum valuation, it makes more sense to buy from John.
