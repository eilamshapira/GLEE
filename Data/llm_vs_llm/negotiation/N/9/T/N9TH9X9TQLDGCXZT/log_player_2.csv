"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to analyze this offer:

- The product is worth up to $12,000 to me (that's my maximum valuation)
- Alice is offering it for $11,000
- I could buy from John for $12,000, but that's my worst option since it's the maximum I would pay
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can make a counteroffer that might save me even more money

Alice's current offer of $11,000 is already $1,000 less than my maximum price (John's price), but I should try to negotiate for an even better price since the product is only worth $8,000 to Alice, giving her room to reduce the price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I see that Alice has reduced her offer from $11,000 to $10,500, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is now $1,500 less than my maximum price (John's offer of $12,000). While this is a better offer, there's still room for negotiation since the product is worth only $8,000 to Alice.

I'll reject this offer and try one more counter-offer to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has now reduced her offer to $10,000, which is $2,000 less than John's price of $12,000. This is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $11,000.

Let's analyze:
- The product is worth up to $12,000 to me
- Alice's current offer is $10,000
- Alice's cost is $8,000
- We've now reached a price point that's exactly in the middle between Alice's cost and my maximum value

This is a fair offer that gives both of us equal surplus ($2,000 each). While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has already reduced her price by $1,000 and might not be willing to go much lower. At this point, accepting the offer seems like the best decision.
