Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($15,000) and also lower than what the product is worth to him ($12,000), I will reject his offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be $17,000, aiming to maximize my earnings while still being in the realm of what could be considered reasonable given the product's worth to Bob.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $10,500 is still lower than what I'm aiming for, but it's getting closer to the value I have for the product ($15,000) and what it's worth to him ($12,000). However, since I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer and closer to my target, I will consider this option carefully.

Given that Bob's offer is still $4,500 less than what I can get from John, and we are only in round 4 with 6 more rounds to go, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make another counteroffer, trying to meet him halfway between his last offer and the price I can get from John.

My counteroffer will be $16,000, which is slightly lower than my previous offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate but still aiming to maximize my earnings.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $11,250 is increasing, but it's still $3,750 less than what I can get from John. Considering we are halfway through the negotiation rounds, I need to weigh the potential for further increases against the certainty of selling to John.

Given that Bob's offer is worth $12,000 to him, he still has room to increase his offer. My next step will be to try and meet him closer to the midpoint between his current offer and what I can get from John, while also considering the value he places on the product.

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer of $14,500, which is lower than my previous offer, indicating a willingness to find a mutually beneficial price but still aiming to maximize my earnings.
