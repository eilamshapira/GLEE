"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment. Given the value I place on this product, I'd be happy to buy it for $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I can't go as low as $100 since the product is worth $150 to me. I should mention that I have another interested buyer who's willing to pay $150, but I'd like to work with you if possible. Could you meet me in the middle at $155? This would give you a product that's worth more than what you're paying.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $155 is still a bit high for me.  How about $130? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident I can get good value from this product.",130.0,Bob,4,
