Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I can't go as low as $100 since the product is worth $150 to me. I should mention that I have another interested buyer who's willing to pay $150, but I'd like to work with you if possible. Could you meet me in the middle at $155? This would give you a product that's worth more than what you're paying.
