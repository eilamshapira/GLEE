"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's offer. She's asking for $1,400,000, while the product is worth $1,200,000 to her. 

The alternative is to buy from John for $1,500,000, which would be my worst-case scenario. Alice's current offer is already $100,000 better than John's.

However, I can likely negotiate a better price with Alice. We have 10 rounds available, and I should take advantage of that to try and get a price closer to her valuation of $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's below Alice's initial price but still gives her a decent profit above her valuation.

{""product_price"": $1,250,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her price from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is already $150,000 less than John's price.

However, I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so there's still room for further negotiation. Since we have plenty of rounds left (we're only on round 3 of 10), I should continue negotiating to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer somewhat to show I'm negotiating in good faith, while still trying to get a good deal.

{""product_price"": $1,280,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,310,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,310,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has come down again from $1,350,000 to $1,310,000, which is progress. That's now $190,000 less than John's price, and only $110,000 above Alice's valuation of $1,200,000.

We're halfway through our negotiation rounds, and Alice seems willing to continue reducing her price. I think I can still push for a slightly better price since we have 5 more rounds available.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer again to show I'm meeting Alice partway while still trying to get a good deal.
