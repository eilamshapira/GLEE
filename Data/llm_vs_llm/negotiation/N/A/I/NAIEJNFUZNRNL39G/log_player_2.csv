"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $15,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000), it wouldn't be rational to accept Alice's offer. John's offer is equal to my maximum value and is lower than Alice's price, so the best decision would be to buy from John.
