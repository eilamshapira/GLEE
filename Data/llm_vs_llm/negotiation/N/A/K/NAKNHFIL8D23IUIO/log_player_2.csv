"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $950,000, I need to consider my options carefully:

1. Accept Alice's offer for $950,000
2. Reject and make a counteroffer
3. Buy from John for $1,000,000

Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $950,000 (which is $50,000 less than John's price), it makes sense to negotiate further with Alice. The product costs Alice $800,000, so there's room for negotiation between $800,000 and my maximum of $1,000,000.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, as this gives me a chance to save more money.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I see that Alice has lowered her price from $950,000 to $920,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, there's still room for a better deal since the product is worth $800,000 to her.

The new offer of $920,000 is $80,000 less than John's price of $1,000,000, which is a significant improvement. I could accept this, but since Alice reduced her price by $30,000 after my counteroffer, I believe there's still room for negotiation.

I'll reject this offer and try another counteroffer to see if we can reach a better agreement.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has now lowered her price to $900,000, which is very close to my last counteroffer of $890,000. This shows we're approaching a mutually acceptable price point.

At $900,000, I would be:
- Saving $100,000 compared to John's price of $1,000,000
- Paying $100,000 above Alice's cost of $800,000, which seems fair

The difference between Alice's offer and my last counteroffer is only $10,000, which is a small gap at this price point. Continuing negotiations for minimal additional savings might risk the deal, especially since Alice has already come down $50,000 from her initial offer.

Given the substantial savings already achieved and the small remaining difference, I'll accept this offer.
