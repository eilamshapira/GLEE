Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $80 is lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I have the option to sell to John for $120, I will consider my next step carefully.

Given that my goal is to earn as much money as possible for the product, and Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I am willing to accept, I will not accept his offer. Additionally, since I have the option to sell to John for $120, which is higher than any price Bob has offered so far, I will not make a counteroffer at this time.

Therefore, my decision is to sell the product to John for $120, as this guarantees me the highest return for the product.
