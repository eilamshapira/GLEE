"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $150 to me and only $120 to Bob, I know that Bob won't be willing to pay more than $120. Since I have a guaranteed option to sell to John for $150, it wouldn't make sense for me to sell to Bob for less than $150. I'll start with a high offer to see Bob's reaction.
