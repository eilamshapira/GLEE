Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob
2. I won't accept less than $1,000,000 (my minimum price)
3. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000
4. Bob knows that anything below $1,500,000 would be profitable for him

I should offer a price that:
- Is below $1,500,000 (otherwise Bob would reject)
- Is well above $1,000,000 (to maximize my profit)
- Leaves enough profit potential for Bob to accept

I'll offer the product at $1,300,000. This:
- Gives me a $300,000 premium over my minimum
- Leaves $200,000 in potential profit for Bob
- Is a reasonable split of the total surplus
