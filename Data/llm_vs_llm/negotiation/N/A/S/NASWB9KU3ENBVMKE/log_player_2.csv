"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer and decide whether I should accept it, reject it, or buy from John instead.

Alice is offering the product for $1,300,000. The product is worth up to $1,500,000 to me, so Alice's offer is below my maximum value.

If I reject Alice's offer, my alternative is to buy from John for $1,500,000. This would cost me $200,000 more than Alice's offer.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and Alice's offer saves me $200,000 compared to buying from John, I should accept Alice's offer.
