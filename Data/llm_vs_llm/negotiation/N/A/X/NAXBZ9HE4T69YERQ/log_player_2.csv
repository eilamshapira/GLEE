"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be a valuable addition to your collection. After careful consideration, I've set a competitive price for the product. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $950,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000), it wouldn't be rational to accept this offer. I could either try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer or buy from John immediately.

Given that Alice's initial offer is quite high ($150,000 above my maximum value), and I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $800,000, it makes more sense to buy from John rather than enter a potentially lengthy negotiation with Alice, especially since Alice's starting point is so far from my target price.
