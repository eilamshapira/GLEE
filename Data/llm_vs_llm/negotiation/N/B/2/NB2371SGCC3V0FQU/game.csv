"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $180 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product but would need to see it at a lower price.  How about $140?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to be flexible with the price, but I still believe it's worth more than $140. I'd like to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit out of my range. Let's try $155. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to make a deal.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I can see we're getting close to a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to make a small concession to meet your needs, but I still believe the product is worth a bit more than $155. Let's try to find a compromise at $157.50.",157.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $157.50 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $156.25.  This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal.",156.25,Bob,6,
