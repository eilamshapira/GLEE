Alice's offer is way too high. We have plenty of room to negotiate and should aim for a much lower price."

This is a starting point. Let's see how Alice responds and adjust accordingly."

While Alice came down slightly, $22,000 is still far too high. We need to show her we're serious about a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Let's make a smaller increase this time to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."

Alice is coming down, but very slowly.  We still have plenty of rounds to negotiate, and $20,000 is too high. We need to signal that we're willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6

This is a significant jump, but it puts us closer to our walk-away point while still leaving room for negotiation. Let's see how Alice reacts."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice is now negotiating more seriously, $18,000 is still much higher than our backup plan. We're getting closer, but it's worth holding out a bit longer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 7500}

We're getting close to our limit, but let's see if we can get Alice to come down a bit more. This offer leaves some room for a final compromise."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

It's clear that Alice is unlikely to meet our desired price point. While she might go down a bit more, we're running out of rounds, and the difference is now too significant. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product from John for $8,000."
