"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I'm definitely interested in the product, $150 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $50.  Let me know what you think.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $50 is below the product's value. I'm willing to make a compromise and lower the price to $140. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice.  I'm still quite a ways off from that price point though. I could go up to $60, but that's as high as I can go right now.",60.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $60 is still below the product's value. I'm willing to make another compromise and lower the price to $130. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",130.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but we seem pretty far apart still.  I can stretch my budget to $70, but that's the absolute maximum I can spend. If that doesn't work, I'll have to look at other options.",70.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I still can't meet you at $70. I can lower the price to $120. If this doesn't work, I may need to consider other options as well.",120.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand.  It seems we're at an impasse. I'm willing to offer a final price of $75.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to go with another seller I've been talking to.  I'd prefer to buy from you, but I can't exceed this price.",75.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer again. However, $75 is still below the product's value. I'm willing to make one final compromise and lower the price to $110. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider selling to another buyer.",110.0,Alice,9,
