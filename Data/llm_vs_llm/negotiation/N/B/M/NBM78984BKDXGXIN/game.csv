Hi Bob! I've got a great product for you. How about we get this done quickly? I'm offering it to you for $150.,150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me. I know I can get this product from another seller for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product. This would save me some money compared to my alternative option, and hopefully still work for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $80 is too low for me, as I value this product at more than that. How about we meet in the middle? I'll offer it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. However, I still can't go above $100 since that's what John is offering me for the identical product. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need to get it for less - say $90. This gives you a sale and saves me $10 compared to my other option. What do you say?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate you being upfront about John's offer. However, this product is worth more than $90 to me. How about $110? That's only a little bit more than John is offering you.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down to $110, Alice. We're getting closer. However, I still need to be practical about this. John is offering the exact same product for $100, and that's my maximum budget for this item. If you can match that price of $100, I'd be happy to do business with you rather than going to John. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,6,
