"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I've got a great product for you. How about we get this done quickly? I'm offering it to you for $150."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me. I know I can get this product from another seller for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product. This would save me some money compared to my alternative option, and hopefully still work for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Okay, here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $80 is too low for me, as I value this product at more than that. How about we meet in the middle? I'll offer it to you for $120."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. However, I still can't go above $100 since that's what John is offering me for the identical product. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need to get it for less - say $90. This gives you a sale and saves me $10 compared to my other option. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","This is a tough one. Bob's bringing up John, which is a good negotiating tactic. However, I still want to maximize my profit. My options are: sell to John for $100, or try to get Bob to pay more. Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate you being upfront about John's offer. However, this product is worth more than $90 to me. How about $110? That's only a little bit more than John is offering you."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down to $110, Alice. We're getting closer. However, I still need to be practical about this. John is offering the exact same product for $100, and that's my maximum budget for this item. If you can match that price of $100, I'd be happy to do business with you rather than going to John. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","This is a critical point. Bob is offering me $100, and that's the same as what John offers. This is my decision:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
