"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I've got a great product for you. How about we get this done quickly? I'm offering it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to evaluate Alice's offer. She's offering the product for $150, but I already know that the product is worth no more than $100 to me. Additionally, John is willing to sell the same product for $100.

Alice's price is significantly higher than my maximum value and higher than John's alternative price. There's no reason to accept this offer when I can get the same product for less elsewhere.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me. I know I can get this product from another seller for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product. This would save me some money compared to my alternative option, and hopefully still work for you."", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! $80 is too low for me, as I value this product at more than that. How about we meet in the middle? I'll offer it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has lowered her price from $150 to $120, which shows some willingness to negotiate. However, her current offer is still higher than John's price of $100. Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and I can definitely buy it from John for $100, there's no reason to accept this offer of $120.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. However, I still can't go above $100 since that's what John is offering me for the identical product. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need to get it for less - say $90. This gives you a sale and saves me $10 compared to my other option. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate you being upfront about John's offer. However, this product is worth more than $90 to me. How about $110? That's only a little bit more than John is offering you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has lowered her price again to $110, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but this price is still above the $100 that John is offering. Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and I have a guaranteed option to buy it for $100 from John, there's no rational reason for me to pay $110.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down to $110, Alice. We're getting closer. However, I still need to be practical about this. John is offering the exact same product for $100, and that's my maximum budget for this item. If you can match that price of $100, I'd be happy to do business with you rather than going to John. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
