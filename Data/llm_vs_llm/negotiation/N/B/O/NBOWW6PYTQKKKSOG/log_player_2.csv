Alice is getting closer, but it's still not a great deal compared to John's offer. I'll push a bit further, but I need to be mindful of the remaining rounds."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This is close, but I believe I can get it lower with one more round. The risk of Alice not budging is worth the potential savings."

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
