Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $20,000, which reflects its quality and market value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $6000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $6,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Let me make a counteroffer.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. However, $6,000 is too low for the value this product provides. I can offer it to you for $15,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. However, $6,000 is too low for the value this product provides. I can offer it to you for $15,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the new offer, Alice. While $15000 is a good reduction, it's still a bit high for me. I can go up to $7000. Is that something you can consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Given that Bob's second offer of $7,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and his incremental increase of only $1,000 suggests he's unlikely to reach my minimum price, I'll take the guaranteed $10,000 from John. This ensures I get my minimum desired value for the product."
