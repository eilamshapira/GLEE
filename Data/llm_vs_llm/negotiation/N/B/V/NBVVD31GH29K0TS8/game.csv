"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I have a budget constraint and can't go beyond $8000. Would you consider selling the product for $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it still allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know if you're interested in this price.",12000.0,Alice,3,
