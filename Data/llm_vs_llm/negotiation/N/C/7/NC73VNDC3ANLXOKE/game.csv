"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $12000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to a budget I'm comfortable with. How about $13500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $13500 is still a bit lower than what I can reasonably accept. How about we meet in the middle at $14750? I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.",14750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further. Would you consider $14000?",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to have to stick to my previous offer of $14750. This is a fair price, and it's really the best I can do. Let's finalize this deal.",14750.0,Alice,7,
