"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $12000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to have to stick to my previous offer of $14750. This is a fair price, and it's really the best I can do. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,750.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Getting the product for $10,000 from John is a better outcome than risking a higher price from Alice."
