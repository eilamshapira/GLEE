"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'm looking for $1100000, which I think is a fair value considering its worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I believe your asking price is a bit high. Given market conditions, I'd like to propose $900000 for the product. This still provides you with a substantial profit margin and represents a fair value for both parties.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market conditions, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $900000. Considering your initial interest and the product's worth to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'd like to propose $1000000 as a fair price for both parties.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
