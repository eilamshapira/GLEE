"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'm looking for $1100000, which I think is a fair value considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,200,000
2. Alice's current offer is $1,100,000
3. I know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice
4. John's fixed price is $1,200,000 (this is my worst-case option)
5. Since Alice's cost is $800,000, there's room for negotiation

The current offer of $1,100,000 is below my maximum value, but there's still potential to negotiate a better price since Alice has a significant profit margin ($300,000). I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer that's still profitable for Alice but better for me.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable and still gives Alice a good profit margin above her $800,000 cost.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I believe your asking price is a bit high. Given market conditions, I'd like to propose $900,000 for the product. This still provides you with a substantial profit margin and represents a fair value for both parties."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market conditions, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $900000. Considering your initial interest and the product's worth to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'd like to propose $1000000 as a fair price for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $1,100,000 to $1,000,000
2. This is a $200,000 savings compared to John's price
3. Alice's cost is $800,000, so she's still making a $200,000 profit
4. The negotiation is moving in the right direction
5. While there might still be room for negotiation, the current offer is quite reasonable

Given that:
- The offer is significantly below my maximum value ($1,200,000)
- We've already achieved a substantial reduction from the initial price
- The risk of continued negotiation might not be worth the potential additional savings
- This price point represents a fair middle ground

I think it's reasonable to accept this offer.
