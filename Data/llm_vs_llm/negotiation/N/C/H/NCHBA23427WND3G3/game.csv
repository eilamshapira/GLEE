,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is far above my budget. I can find similar products for much less elsewhere. I would be willing to pay $8000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $8000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $20000. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with your purchase.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $20000 is still far above what I can justify spending. The market rate for similar products is much lower. I can go up to $9000, which is a 12.5% increase from my previous offer. This is a fair price that works within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I can go down to $18000. This is my final offer closer to $20000.  I believe this represents excellent value for a product of this quality.",18000.0,Alice,5,
