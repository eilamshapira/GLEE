"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this excellent product. I'm asking for $25000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $10,000 and also much higher than John's alternative offer. It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as there's room for negotiation. Even if negotiations fail, I can always fall back on John's $10,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25,000 is far above my budget. I can find similar products for much less elsewhere. I would be willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 8000}

I'm starting with an offer below John's price of $10,000 to leave room for negotiation. This gives me the flexibility to potentially increase my offer while still staying below my maximum value, and also below John's alternative price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $8000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $20000. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $20,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000). While she did reduce the price by $5,000, showing some willingness to negotiate, the current price is still too high. I'll continue negotiating as there's still significant room for price reduction, and I always have John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $20,000 is still far above what I can justify spending. The market rate for similar products is much lower. I can go up to $9,000, which is a 12.5% increase from my previous offer. This is a fair price that works within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}

I'm strategically increasing my offer by $1,000 to show good faith in negotiations while still staying below John's price. This maintains room for further negotiation while demonstrating that I'm willing to be flexible. If Alice doesn't come down significantly in the next round, I might consider switching to John's offer, but for now, there's still potential for reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I can go down to $18000. This is my final offer closer to $20000.  I believe this represents excellent value for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'm choosing to buy from John for $10,000 because:
1. Alice's latest offer of $18,000 is still significantly above John's price of $10,000
2. Alice's small price reductions (from $25,000 to $20,000 to $18,000) and her statement about this being her ""final offer closer to $20,000"" suggest she's unlikely to come down to a price near $10,000
3. We've already gone through 5 rounds of negotiation with limited progress
4. John's offer of $10,000 is at my maximum value point, making it a reasonable deal
5. Continuing negotiations would likely be unproductive given Alice's negotiation pattern

It's better to secure the product at a known fair price than continue negotiations that show little promise of reaching my target price range."
