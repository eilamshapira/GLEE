"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice's offer matches your maximum price, there's no harm in seeing if you can get a better deal.  You might be able to buy the product for less than $150 from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $75} 

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer allows room for negotiation. It's possible Alice values the product far less than $150 and might accept a lower price. Even if she rejects it, it gives you information to adjust your next offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice reducing her price significantly suggests she's willing to negotiate. There's still room to bargain below $130 and potentially save more before reaching your maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $100}

**Reasoning:** 

This counteroffer splits the difference between her previous offer ($130) and my last counteroffer ($75). It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly lower than her initial offer and John's alternative."
