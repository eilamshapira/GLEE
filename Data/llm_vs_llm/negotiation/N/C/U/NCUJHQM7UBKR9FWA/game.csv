"Bob, I'm excited you're interested in acquiring this unique asset. Given its unparalleled potential and the considerable value it represents, I'm initially offering it to you for $3000000. I believe this reflects a fair starting point considering its long-term returns.",3000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this asset has potential, that initial price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to start the conversation at $750000.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. As I mentioned, this is a very unique and valuable asset. I understand you are trying to get a good deal, but I cannot go that low. Let's try to find a number that works for both of us. How about $2750000?",2750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're still quite far apart, but I appreciate you coming up a bit. I'm hesitant to move too drastically, so let's meet in the middle a little. I could come down to $2400000.",2400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground.  To be candid, anything above $1300000 would be very difficult for me to justify.  I'm hopeful we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
