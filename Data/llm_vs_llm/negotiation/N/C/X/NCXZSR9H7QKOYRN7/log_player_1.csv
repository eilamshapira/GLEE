Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. The product is worth $80 to Bob and $120 is my minimum acceptable price since I can sell it to John for that amount. Since $120 is above Bob's valuation of $80, it's unlikely he'll accept an offer at or above $120. However, I'll start with a high offer to leave room for negotiation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120 (which I can get from John), and also well below my reservation value, there's no reason to accept this offer. While I could make a counteroffer, since Bob values the product at only $80, he will never accept an offer of $120 or higher. Therefore, the rational decision is to end the negotiation with Bob and sell to John.
