"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Considering the options:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer:** This results in a loss for me, as I'd be selling for less than my minimum value.
*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer and counter:** This is the most reasonable option at this stage.
*   **(3) Sell to John:** This guarantees me my minimum value, but leaves room for a higher profit.

Since I have 10 rounds and Bob is offering significantly less than the product's worth to me, I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer for round 3:

```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Okay, let's evaluate the options again:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer:** This means selling for $1,400,000, which is less than my minimum but still a profit.
*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer and counter:** This means risking more rounds but potentially securing a higher price.
*   **(3) Sell to John:** This guarantees $1,500,000, which is safe and higher than Bob's offer.

Given that I have a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000, I'd rather take the safe offer.
