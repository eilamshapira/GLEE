(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Given that Alice is offering the product for $150, which is my maximum acceptable price, and I can buy it from John for the same price, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer immediately. Trying to negotiate a lower price from Alice is worthwhile since it could potentially save me money.
