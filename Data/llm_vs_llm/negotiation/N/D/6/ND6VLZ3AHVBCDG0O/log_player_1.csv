"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $13,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Given my budget constraints and market alternatives, I'm prepared to buy the product for $10000. Let me know if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. $10,000 is too low considering the product's value to Bob is $15,000. There's still room for negotiation to reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for this product given its quality and value. I can come down from my initial price, but I'm looking for $12,500.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. To meet you halfway and move toward closing the deal, I'm prepared to increase my offer slightly to $11500. I believe this is a fair compromise given the market value and my budget constraints. Let me know if we can finalize on that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $11,500. This is a reasonable compromise that gives me a good profit margin above my minimum price of $8,000, and while it's below the product's full value to Bob ($15,000), it's a fair price that closes the deal without risking further negotiations that might break down."
