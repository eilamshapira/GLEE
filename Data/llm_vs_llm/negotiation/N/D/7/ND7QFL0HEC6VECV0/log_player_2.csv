"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $120
2. The product is worth $120 to me (maximum I'm willing to pay)
3. John's price is also $120
4. My goal is to save money while getting the product

Since Alice's offer ($120) is the same as both:
- The maximum I'm willing to pay ($120)
- John's price ($120)

There's no financial advantage in choosing one option over another. Since Alice made the offer first and the price is acceptable, I might as well accept her offer.
