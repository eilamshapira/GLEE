"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1500000 is quite high for this product. I know there are similar products available in the market for much less. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product, which would still give you a reasonable profit. Let me know if this works for you.",900000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $900000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to lower my price to $1350000, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Please let me know if this works for you.",1350000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $1275000. This price reflects a significant discount while still recognizing the product's true value. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
