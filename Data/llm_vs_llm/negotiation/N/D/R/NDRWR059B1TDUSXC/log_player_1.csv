"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $120 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. 

My counteroffer: $180"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're on a budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $120. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'll meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $180 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your new offer and my previous counteroffer. I think we can find a better price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob's new offer is $150, which is the same price that John is willing to pay, and it's also the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $150."
