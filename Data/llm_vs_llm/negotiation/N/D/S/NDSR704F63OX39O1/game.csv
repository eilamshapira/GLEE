"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know you'll be very impressed with its value. I'm asking $18000 for it. Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $18000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm prepared to offer $8500 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to your competitor.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you considering my product. While I understand your position, $8500 is too low. Given the unique value and features of this product compared to what John is offering, I think $16500 is a very reasonable price. What do you say?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16500 is still significantly above what makes sense for me. John is offering the exact same product for $10000, which is actually my absolute maximum budget for this purchase. If you can beat that price, I'd be happy to buy from you instead. I'm willing to offer $9500, which saves me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. This is really the highest I can go considering my other option.",9500.0,Bob,4,
