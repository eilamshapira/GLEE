Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $18000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm prepared to offer $8500 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to your competitor. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you considering my product. While I understand your position, $8500 is too low.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16500 is still significantly above what makes sense for me. John is offering the exact same product for $10000, which is actually my absolute maximum budget for this purchase. If you can beat that price, I'd be happy to buy from you instead. I'm willing to offer $9500, which saves me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. This is really the highest I can go considering my other option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
