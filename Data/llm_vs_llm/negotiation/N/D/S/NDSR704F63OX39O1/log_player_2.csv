"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know you'll be very impressed with its value. I'm asking $18000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice is offering the product for $18,000, which is significantly higher than the $10,000 maximum value to me and also higher than John's price of $10,000, it makes no sense to accept this offer. I should either counter-offer or buy from John.

Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum valuation ($10,000), I could just buy from him immediately. However, I might be able to get a better deal from Alice through negotiation, so I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $18,000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $10,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm prepared to offer $8,500 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to your competitor."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you considering my product. While I understand your position, $8500 is too low. Given the unique value and features of this product compared to what John is offering, I think $16500 is a very reasonable price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her price from $18,000 to $16,500, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this price is still significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000). I can either continue negotiating with Alice or buy from John right now.

Since John's price matches my maximum valuation, and Alice is still asking for $6,500 more than that, the rational choice is to either buy from John or try one more counteroffer with Alice.

I'll reject her current offer as it's still not competitive with my alternative option.

John is offering the exact same product for $10,000, which is actually my absolute maximum budget for this purchase. If you can beat that price, I'd be happy to buy from you instead. I'm willing to offer $9,500, which saves me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. This is really the highest I can go considering my other option."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
