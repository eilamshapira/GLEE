"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $12000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $12000 is well above what I'm willing to pay for this product. I know the product is worth $8000 to you, and I can actually get it from another seller, John, for exactly $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $7000 for the product, which would still give you a reasonable profit while saving me some money compared to my alternative option. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However, $7000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $9500? This allows us both to benefit from the deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for coming down on your price, but $9500 is still more than what I can get elsewhere. I need to be direct - I can purchase this identical product from John for exactly $8000. If you want my business, you'll need to offer me a better price than that. I'm willing to pay $7500, which would still give you a reasonable profit from your cost of $7000, while giving me an incentive to buy from you rather than John. This is a win-win for both of us. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to go with John's offer.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and desire for a good deal. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $8700. This is a final offer, as I value my time and need to move forward soon.  What do you think?",8700.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be completely transparent here. I can buy this exact product from John for $8000, which is already my maximum budget for this item. There's simply no logical reason for me to pay $8700 when I have a cheaper alternative readily available. If you can beat or at least match John's price of $8000, I'd be happy to do business with you instead. My final offer is $7800 - this gives you something close to what I can get elsewhere while still providing you with a profit. If this doesn't work for you, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.",7800.0,Bob,6,
