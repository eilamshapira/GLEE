"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $12000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000 and even higher than John's offer of $8,000. There's no reason for me to accept this offer when I can get the same product for $8,000 from John. However, I'll first try to negotiate with Alice to see if I can get a better price before going to John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $12,000 is well above what I'm willing to pay for this product. I know the product is worth $8,000 to you, and I can actually get it from another seller, John, for exactly $8,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $7,000 for the product, which would still give you a reasonable profit while saving me some money compared to my alternative option. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However, $7000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $9500? This allows us both to benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still higher than John's offer of $8,000. Since I can get the exact same product from John for $8,000, there's no reason for me to pay $9,500 to Alice. I'll reject this offer and make a final counteroffer before considering just going with John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for coming down on your price, but $9,500 is still more than what I can get elsewhere. I need to be direct - I can purchase this identical product from John for exactly $8,000. If you want my business, you'll need to offer me a better price than that. I'm willing to pay $7,500, which would still give you a reasonable profit from your cost of $7,000, while giving me an incentive to buy from you rather than John. This is a win-win for both of us. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and desire for a good deal. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $8700. This is a final offer, as I value my time and need to move forward soon.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer of $8,700 is still $700 more than John's offer of $8,000. Since I can get the exact same product from John for less, and the product is only worth a maximum of $8,000 to me, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer. I'll reject this offer and make one more attempt at a reasonable price before going with John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be completely transparent here. I can buy this exact product from John for $8,000, which is already my maximum budget for this item. There's simply no logical reason for me to pay $8,700 when I have a cheaper alternative readily available. If you can beat or at least match John's price of $8,000, I'd be happy to do business with you instead. My final offer is $7,800 - this gives you something close to what I can get elsewhere while still providing you with a profit. If this doesn't work for you, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 7800}"
