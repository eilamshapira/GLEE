"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I understand that this product has a value of $120 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110, which gives you a $10 benefit from this transaction. This is a fair offer that allows both of us to profit from the deal. If you accept, I'll make $10 more than my alternative option, and you'll gain $10 in value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
