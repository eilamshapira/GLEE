"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a incredible offer for you. I'm selling a highly valuable product that is worth every penny. I'm offering it to you for $2000000. This is a fantastic opportunity for a discerning buyer like yourself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than both:
1. My maximum valuation of the product ($1,000,000)
2. John's alternative offer ($1,000,000)

It would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. Since John is offering the same product for $1,000,000, which matches my maximum valuation, the best decision would be to buy from John.
