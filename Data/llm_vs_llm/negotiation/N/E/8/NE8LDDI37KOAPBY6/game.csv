"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. Unfortunately, $1200000 is far below what I can accept, especially given the exceptional value of this product. However, in the spirit of negotiation, I’m prepared to reduce my asking price from my initial offer. My counteroffer is $1750000. Let me know if this works for you.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $1750000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'd like to propose a price of $1475000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm looking forward to your response.",1475000.0,Bob,4,
