Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. I need to:
1. Set a price high enough to maximize my profit
2. But not so high that Bob will definitely reject it
3. Consider my fallback option of $120 from John

Since I know I can get $120 guaranteed from John, I should offer Bob a higher price. I'll set it at $175, which:
- Gives me a significant profit if Bob accepts
- Is not unreasonably high for many products
- Still leaves room for Bob to get value if the product is worth more to him
- If Bob rejects, I'm still fine with my $120 from John
