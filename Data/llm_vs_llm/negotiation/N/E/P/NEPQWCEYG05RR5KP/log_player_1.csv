Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this unique product. Considering its value and exclusivity, I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $900,000 and the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, I will reject Bob's offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but given the product's value and the offers I've received, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see where you're coming from, but $1400000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950000. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Given the options, I need to decide whether to continue negotiating with Bob, risking a lower price, or sell to John immediately for $1,200,000. Bob's current offer is significantly below what the product is worth to me, and far below what I can get from John. I've already dropped my price and he's still low.

Therefore, I'll choose to sell to John.
