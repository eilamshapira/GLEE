"Hi Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $18000 is higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $12000. Would you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for getting back to me. I understand that $18000 might be stretching your budget. However, $12000 is a bit too low for us to accept. Let's split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $15000, which is still a great deal for a product of this value.",15000.0,Alice,3,
