"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’d like to offer you the product for $14000. I believe this is a great deal considering its value. Let me know if you’re interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Looking at the situation:

- Alice is offering the product for $14,000
- The product is worth at most $12,000 to me
- John is willing to sell me the same product for $12,000

Since Alice's offer ($14,000) exceeds the product's worth to me ($12,000), and I have a better alternative with John at $12,000, the logical choice is to go with John's offer.
