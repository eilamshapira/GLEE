"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob and I want to earn as much money as I can, I'll start by offering a high price. 

{""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $950,000 is higher than the minimum amount I'm willing to accept ($800,000) but lower than my initial offer, I'll consider it. However, I still have room to negotiate and try to get a better price.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle or closer to my initial offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob offered $950,000 and my initial offer was $1,400,000, I'll try to find a middle ground. I'll reduce my price, but not too much, to see if Bob is willing to meet me closer to my target.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's new offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to my target, but I still think I can get a better price. Since we're only at Round 4 and I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, I'll reject Bob's offer again and try to get an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's last offer was $1,050,000 and my previous offer was $1,250,000, I'll try to find a compromise. I'll reduce my price slightly, but still aim to get a good deal.
