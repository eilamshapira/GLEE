"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering the product at $1,400,000, which is $100,000 less than John's standing offer of $1,500,000. While this is a savings, I know the product is only worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's significant room for negotiation.

Given that we have up to 10 rounds to negotiate, I should reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me while still allowing room for Alice to profit.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives Alice a good profit margin while being significantly better for me than the initial offer.

{""product_price"": $950,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her offer from $1,400,000 to $1,250,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. While this is a significant improvement and already $250,000 less than John's price, there's still room for further negotiation considering the product is worth $800,000 to Alice.

Since we have plenty of rounds left and Alice has already shown willingness to come down substantially, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I see that Alice came down $150,000 from her initial offer, which shows she's willing to negotiate meaningfully. I'll increase my offer from my initial $950,000, but still maintain a price that gives me good value while providing Alice with a substantial profit.

{""product_price"": $1,050,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is $350,000 less than John's price and represents continued movement in our negotiation. We've had a pattern where Alice has reduced her offer by $100,000 each time, showing she's serious about making a deal.

Since this price would already save me $350,000 compared to buying from John, and we've established a good negotiation pattern, I'll accept Alice's offer.
