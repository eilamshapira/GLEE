"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1200000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a slight concession. Let's discuss this further.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1400000 is still a bit more than I can reasonably afford.  I'm happy to meet you at $1300000. This is a good deal for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the transaction quickly.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
