Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $1,200,000 because I believe the product is worth more to him, and I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1,200,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1400000 is still a bit more than I can reasonably afford.  I'm happy to meet you at $1300000. This is a good deal for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the transaction quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I accept Bob's offer of $1,300,000. While it's still slightly lower than my initial target, it's a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a good deal considering the back-and-forth negotiation. Selling to Bob at this price is better than selling to John for $1,000,000, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by pushing for an even higher price."
