"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you at a price of $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Based on the information provided:

1. You value the product at no more than $8,000
2. Alice is offering to sell it to you for $15,000
3. John (alternative seller) will sell it to you for $8,000

Since Alice's offer ($15,000) exceeds both your maximum valuation and John's price, the rational decision is to buy from John.
