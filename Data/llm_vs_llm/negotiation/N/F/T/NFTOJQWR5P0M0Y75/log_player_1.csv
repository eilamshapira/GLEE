Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. I know that:
1. The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $1,500,000
3. Bob's valuation is unknown, but he might value it higher

Given these factors, I should offer a price significantly above $1,500,000 to maximize my potential profit. If Bob rejects it, I lose nothing since I can still sell to John. I'll set a price that leaves room for substantial profit while still being potentially acceptable.
