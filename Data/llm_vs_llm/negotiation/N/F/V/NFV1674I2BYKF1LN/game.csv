"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's features, $12000 is beyond my budget. My maximum budget for this purchase is $8000. Would you consider selling it for $6000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $6000 is too low for this product. Given that you mentioned your maximum budget is $8000, I can offer it to you for $9000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. Would this work for you?",9000.0,Alice,3,
