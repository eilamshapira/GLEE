Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $12,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's features, $12000 is beyond my budget. My maximum budget for this purchase is $8000. Would you consider selling it for $6000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. His offer of $6,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but since he mentioned having a budget of $8,000, I'll try to negotiate closer to that amount.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $6,000 is too low for this product. Given that you mentioned your maximum budget is $8,000, I can offer it to you for $9,000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
