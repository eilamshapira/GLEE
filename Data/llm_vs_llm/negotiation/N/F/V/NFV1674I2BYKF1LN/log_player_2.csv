# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $6000 is too low for this product. Given that you mentioned your maximum budget is $8000, I can offer it to you for $9000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. Would this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
