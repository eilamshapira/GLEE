"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offer is $150, which is exactly the same as John's price
2. This is just the first round, so I have room to negotiate with Alice for a better price
3. Since I can always fall back to John's offer of $150 later, there's no risk in trying to negotiate with Alice for a lower price

Therefore, it makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low that it would be considered unreasonable:

{""product_price"": 90}

This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $150, but it's not insultingly low. It gives us room to negotiate upward while potentially achieving a better price than John's $150 offer. If Alice rejects this, we can gradually increase our offer in subsequent rounds while still maintaining the option to go to John if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has reduced her price from $150 to $130, which is a significant improvement and $20 less than John's price. However, since we still have 7 rounds left and Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing her price, we might be able to get an even better deal. Let's continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $150 to $130, showing willingness to negotiate, and my previous offer of $90 was rejected, I'll make a more reasonable counteroffer by meeting somewhere in the middle:

{""product_price"": 110}

This offer is a significant increase from my previous $90 offer, showing good faith in the negotiation, while still being $20 less than Alice's last offer. It leaves some room for further negotiation while being a more reasonable proposal than my initial offer."
