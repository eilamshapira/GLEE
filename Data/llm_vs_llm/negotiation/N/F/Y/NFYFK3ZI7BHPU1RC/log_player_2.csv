"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know the product is worth $10,000 to me and I can get it from John at that price, I'll start with a lower offer to negotiate with Alice.

{""product_price"": 7500}

This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $15,000, but it gives room for negotiation while still being a reasonable starting point. If Alice rejects this, we can gradually increase our offer, but we won't go above $10,000 since that's our alternative option with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice only came down $1,000 from her initial offer of $15,000 to $14,000, but we know we can get it for $10,000 from John, I'll increase my previous offer slightly but still stay well below John's price.

{""product_price"": 8500}

This offer shows some movement from my initial $7,500 offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate, but still maintains a strong negotiating position since we have the $10,000 alternative from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has been reducing her price by $1,000 each time but is still well above our alternative of $10,000 from John. Let's make another counteroffer.

{""product_price"": 9500}

This offer is close to our maximum of $10,000 (John's price) but still gives us a small advantage if Alice accepts. If she rejects this, we should seriously consider taking John's offer since we're running out of rounds and Alice's rate of price reduction isn't fast enough to reach a price below $10,000 in the remaining rounds."
