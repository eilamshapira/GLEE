"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given the information you've provided, Alice's offering price of $1,200,000 is equivalent to the product's worth to her and exceeds the maximum value of $800,000 the product is worth to me. Additionally, John is offering the product at exactly $800,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.

Since Alice's initial offer provides no savings compared to the product's value to her, and is significantly higher than John's offer, it makes financial sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives us room to negotiate but also reflects that I have a strong alternative with John's offer.
