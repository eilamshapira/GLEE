"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $18000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations if you're interested.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $18000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $10000? I believe that's a fair starting point for further negotiation.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $10000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to sell for. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $16000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $16000 is still a little high for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13000?  This would represent a significant discount from your initial asking price.",13000.0,Bob,4,
