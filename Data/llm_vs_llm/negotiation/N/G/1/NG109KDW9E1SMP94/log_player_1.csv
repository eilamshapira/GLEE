Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $18,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $18000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $10000? I believe that's a fair starting point for further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is lower than what John is willing to pay ($12,000), and it's also lower than the product's value to me, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $10,000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to sell for. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $16,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I'm open to further negotiations if needed."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $16000 is still a little high for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13000?  This would represent a significant discount from your initial asking price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $13,000 is higher than what John is willing to pay ($12,000), I will accept Bob's offer. This way, I can earn more money for the product than I would by selling it to John."
