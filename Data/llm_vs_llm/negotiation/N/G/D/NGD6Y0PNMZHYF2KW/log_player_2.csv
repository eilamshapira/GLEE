"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,750,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,200,000 for the product. It also exceeds John's asking price of $1,200,000. It would be better to either negotiate with Alice for a lower price or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is below my maximum value of $1,200,000 and gives room for negotiation. If Alice rejects this offer, I can still either negotiate further or fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000. Since Alice's product is worth $1,500,000 to her, she might counter with a price closer to that value, but I need to ensure I don't pay more than my maximum value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's new offer of $1,600,000 is still well above my maximum value of $1,200,000, and she hasn't shown much willingness to negotiate down to a price that would work for me. Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value of $1,200,000, it makes the most sense to take his offer rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to result in a better deal from Alice."
