"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, the price is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1200000 for the product considering its value to me. Let me know if this works for you.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I need to be transparent that $1200000 is below what I can accept for this product. While my initial offer might have been high, the product's true value and market demand justify a price of $1800000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents a fair price point that takes into account your budget constraints while reflecting the product's real value.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $1800000 is still beyond what I can justify spending. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1350000, which is the highest I can go while still considering it a good investment. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
