Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it for $2,300,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential return on investment."", ""product_price"": 2300000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, the price is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1200000 for the product considering its value to me. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer because:
1. Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000
2. While I could sell to John for $1,500,000, Bob's willingness to negotiate suggests there might be room to achieve a better price
3. Bob's initial counteroffer shows he's interested, just trying to negotiate down from my initial price

I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I need to be transparent that $1,200,000 is below what I can accept for this product. While my initial offer might have been high, the product's true value and market demand justify a price of $1,800,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents a fair price point that takes into account your budget constraints while reflecting the product's real value."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $1800000 is still beyond what I can justify spending. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1350000, which is the highest I can go while still considering it a good investment. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

I'm choosing to sell to John because:
1. Bob's new offer of $1,350,000 is still below John's guaranteed $1,500,000
2. Bob's increase from $1,200,000 to $1,350,000 was relatively small, and he stated this is ""the highest I can go""
3. Continuing negotiations with Bob might be futile since he's explicitly stated his maximum price, which is below my alternative option
4. Taking John's offer ensures I get $1,500,000, which meets my minimum acceptable price and is better than Bob's best offer"
