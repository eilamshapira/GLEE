Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I need to be transparent that $1200000 is below what I can accept for this product. While my initial offer might have been high, the product's true value and market demand justify a price of $1800000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents a fair price point that takes into account your budget constraints while reflecting the product's real value.
