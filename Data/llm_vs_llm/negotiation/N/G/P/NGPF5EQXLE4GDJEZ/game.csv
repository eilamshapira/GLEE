"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $10000 at this time.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $10000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $18000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $18000, but I'm still sticking to my budget of $10000. This is the highest I can go at this time.  Let me know if you're willing to take it.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $10000. I've thought about it, and I'm willing to make a significant concession. I'll meet you halfway between my previous offer and your budget. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $14000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. If you're truly interested in the product, I hope you'll consider this offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for the concession to $14000, but I'm still only able to offer $12000.  It's getting closer, and I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your revised offer of $12000. It's clear that you're interested in the product, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. I've considered your budget constraints, and I'm making a smaller concession to try to meet you in the middle. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $13500, which is a competitive price for the product. If you're serious about acquiring it, I hope you'll consider this offer.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $13500. I'm getting closer to your price, but I can only go up to $12500.  If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",12500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $12500. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that price. I've thought about it, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $14250, which is a very competitive price considering the product's value. If you're truly interested in acquiring the product, I hope you'll consider this offer. Please note that this is my final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll need to explore other options.",14250.0,Alice,9,
