"Bob, I'm thrilled you're considering acquiring this exceptional product. Given its unique capabilities and the immense value it will bring to your operations, I'm initially offering it to you for $2200000.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2200000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $600000, considering the product's value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand budget constraints, but $600000 is significantly below the product's inherent worth and my minimum acceptable price. I am willing to come down from my initial offer. How about $2100000?",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the slight reduction, but $2100000 is still far beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to meet you halfway, but I need a more substantial compromise. I'm offering $700000, which is the highest I'm comfortable going at this point.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer. While $700000 is still too low, I'm willing to work with you to find a number that works for both of us. Let's try $2000000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it reflects a genuine effort to meet you closer to your budget.",2000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the continued reductions, but $2000000 is still above what I'm willing to pay. I've been flexible with my offers, and I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I'll meet you at $750000, which is very close to my maximum budget. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
