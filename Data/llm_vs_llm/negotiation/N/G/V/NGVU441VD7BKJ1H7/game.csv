"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your competitiveness, but I think we can find a price that works better for both of us. The product is interesting, but I can only justify spending $110 for it. This would still give you a reasonable profit while helping me stay within my budget. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $130, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for being flexible, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $130. That's movement in the right direction, but I'm still finding it a bit steep for my budget. I can meet you in the middle at $120, which would give you a solid $20 profit on the item. This seems like a fair compromise that works for both of us. What do you say?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. I can see that we're getting close to a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still a bit short of where I'd like to be. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $125. This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",125.0,Alice,5,
