Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your competitiveness, but I think we can find a price that works better for both of us. The product is interesting, but I can only justify spending $110 for it. This would still give you a reasonable profit while helping me stay within my budget. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I can meet you in the middle at $120, which would give you a solid $20 profit on the item. This seems like a fair compromise that works for both of us. What do you say?
