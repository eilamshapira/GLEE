# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I've set a competitive price for it, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to carefully consider Alice's initial offer. She's offering the product for $140, which is below my maximum budget of $150. However, since the product is worth $100 to Alice, there might be room for negotiation to get a better deal.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your competitiveness, but I think we can find a price that works better for both of us. The product is interesting, but I can only justify spending $110 for it. This would still give you a reasonable profit while helping me stay within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $130, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. Let me know what you think.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has dropped her price from $140 to $130, which is positive movement. While this is still below my maximum value of $150, there is likely still room to negotiate given Alice's cost is $100. I'll continue negotiating as I want to save as much money as possible.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for being flexible, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $130. That's movement in the right direction, but I'm still finding it a bit steep for my budget. I can meet you in the middle at $120, which would give you a solid $20 profit on the item. This seems like a fair compromise that works for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. I can see that we're getting close to a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still a bit short of where I'd like to be. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $125. This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has now come down to $125, which is $25 below my maximum value and represents continued movement in our negotiation. She's only $5 away from my last offer of $120, and she's indicating this is her lowest comfortable price. Given that this represents a good savings compared to John's price of $150, and we're getting close to the limit of negotiation, I'll accept this offer.
