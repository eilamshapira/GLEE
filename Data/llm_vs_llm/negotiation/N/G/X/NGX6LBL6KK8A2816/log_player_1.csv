Bob's offer: The product price will be $60.

Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I certainly can't sell the product for $60, but maybe we can meet somewhere in the middle, Bob? How about the product for $130? This is closer to what I was originally asking for, but still a savings for you."

I see that we can't come to an agreement that will benefit both parties. I appreciate your time, Bob, but I think it's best if I sell the product to John for the agreed-upon price of $120. I can't entertain selling the product for $100, as it is well below the value I place on it, and I have another willing buyer who will pay a premium. Thank you for your interest."
