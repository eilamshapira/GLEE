"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe will meet your needs perfectly. I'm offering it to you for $10000, which I think is a fair price given its value. Let me know if you're interested!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in your product, I find $10000 to be quite high, especially since I can get the same product from John for that price. I know quality products have value, but I'm looking to save some money with this purchase. Would you consider $8500? This would give you a fair profit while helping me stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your need to stay within budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, given its high value and demand, I can't go as low as $8500. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? I believe this is a fair compromise for the quality you're getting. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
