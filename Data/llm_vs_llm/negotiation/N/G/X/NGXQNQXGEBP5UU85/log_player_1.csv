"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in your product, I find $10000 to be quite high, especially since I can get the same product from John for that price. I know quality products have value, but I'm looking to save some money with this purchase. Would you consider $8500? This would give you a fair profit while helping me stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your need to stay within budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, given its high value and demand, I can't go as low as $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I believe this is a fair compromise for the quality you're getting.
