"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe will meet your needs perfectly. I'm offering it to you for $10000, which I think is a fair price given its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'll analyze this negotiation:

Alice is offering the product for $10,000, which is:
- Exactly the same price as John's offer ($10,000)
- Equal to my maximum valuation ($10,000)
- Significantly higher than Alice's valuation ($8,000)

Since Alice's current offer gives me no savings compared to John's offer, and I know there's room for negotiation (given the $2,000 gap between Alice's valuation and her asking price), I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in your product, I find $10,000 to be quite high, especially since I can get the same product from John for that price. I know quality products have value, but I'm looking to save some money with this purchase. Would you consider $8,500? This would give you a fair profit while helping me stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your need to stay within budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, given its high value and demand, I can't go as low as $8500. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? I believe this is a fair compromise for the quality you're getting. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'll analyze the updated situation:

Alice has now offered the product for $9,000, which is:
- $1,000 less than John's offer ($10,000)
- $1,000 less than my maximum valuation ($10,000)
- Still $1,000 more than Alice's valuation ($8,000)

This is a significant improvement from the initial offer and represents good savings compared to my alternative option. While there might be room to negotiate further, $9,000 represents a fair middle ground that gives both of us value - I save $1,000 compared to my alternative, and Alice makes $1,000 more than her minimum.
