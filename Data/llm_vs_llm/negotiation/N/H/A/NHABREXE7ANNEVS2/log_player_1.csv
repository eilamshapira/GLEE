Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to offer a price to Bob that he would accept, but also maximizes my earnings. Since I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me (and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price), I should offer Bob a price above that amount.

Without knowing Bob's valuation, I'll choose a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but not so high that it would likely be rejected outright. A reasonable approach would be to set a price about 50% higher than my minimum value.
