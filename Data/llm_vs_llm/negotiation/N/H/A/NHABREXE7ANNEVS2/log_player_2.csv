"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $18,000 exceeds the $12,000 that the product is worth to me, and John is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $12,000, the logical choice is to buy from John.
