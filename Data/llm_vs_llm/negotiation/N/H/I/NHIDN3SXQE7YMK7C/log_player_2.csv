"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $115. I know it's a valuable item and I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to consider if Alice's offer is worth accepting or if I should go with John's offer or reject both.

Alice is offering the product for $115, while John is offering it for $120. The product is worth at most $120 to me, so I shouldn't pay more than that.

Since Alice's offer ($115) is $5 less than John's offer ($120), and both prices are within my maximum value for the product, it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer and save $5.
