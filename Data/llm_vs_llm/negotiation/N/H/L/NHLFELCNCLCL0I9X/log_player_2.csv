"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $150, which is above my maximum value
3. John is offering it for $120, which matches my maximum value
4. Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than the product's worth to me

I will reject Alice's offer to try to negotiate a better price. If we can't reach a better deal, I can always buy from John later.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice started with $150 and the product is worth $120 to her, I'll make a counteroffer significantly lower than $120 to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be insulting.

{""product_price"": 90}

My reasoning:
1. Starting at $90 gives room for negotiation upward
2. It's low enough to signal that $150 was too high
3. If Alice rejects this, we can potentially meet somewhere in the middle
4. I still have the option to buy from John at $120 if negotiations fail"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has lowered her price from $150 to $135, but this is still above both:
1. The price I can get from John ($120)
2. The maximum value the product has to me ($120)

There's no reason to accept a price of $135 when I can get it for $120 from John. I'll reject and try one more counteroffer since Alice has shown willingness to negotiate downward.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down from $150 to $135, showing willingness to negotiate, I'll increase my previous offer but still stay below John's price to try to find a middle ground.

{""product_price"": 105}

My reasoning:
1. My previous offer was $90, and Alice came down to $135
2. $105 is a reasonable increase from my side, showing willingness to negotiate
3. This price gives Alice room to make a profit (as it's worth $120 to her)
4. It's still below John's price of $120, giving me savings if accepted
5. If Alice rejects this, I can still go to John"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $130 is still higher than John's price of $120. Since:
1. I can get the same product from John for $120
2. The product is only worth $120 to me
3. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Alice is still above the competitive price
4. Alice seems to be making only small concessions ($135 to $130)

It's time to end the negotiation and buy from John. There's no reason to pay more than $120 when that option is available.
