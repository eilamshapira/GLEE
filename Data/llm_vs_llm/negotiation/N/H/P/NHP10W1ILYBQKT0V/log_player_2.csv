"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'll analyze this offer:

The product is worth up to $12,000 to me, so Alice's offer of $11,500 is within my acceptable range.
However, I can potentially negotiate a better price with Alice, as the product is only worth $10,000 to her.
I still have 10 rounds of negotiation left, so there's plenty of time to reach a better deal.
John's offer of $12,000 is my fallback option, but it's more expensive than Alice's current offer.

Given these factors, I'll reject Alice's initial offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has lowered her price from $11,500 to $11,200, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, I believe there's still room to get a better price since the product is only worth $10,000 to her.

I still have plenty of negotiation rounds left, so I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has now lowered her price to $11,000, which is a $500 reduction from her initial offer. This is good progress, but I still believe we can reach a better deal considering the product is worth $10,000 to her.

I've made two counteroffers so far, and Alice has reduced her price each time in response. This suggests further negotiation could be productive.

I'll reject this offer and make one more counteroffer.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has now offered $10,950, which is very close to my last counteroffer of $10,900. We're now negotiating over a very small difference of just $50.

Let's consider the situation:
- We've made significant progress from her initial $11,500 offer
- The current price of $10,950 is well below my maximum value of $12,000
- The price is approaching Alice's cost of $10,000
- We're reaching a point of diminishing returns in the negotiation

Given that we're so close and the difference is minimal, I'll accept this offer.
