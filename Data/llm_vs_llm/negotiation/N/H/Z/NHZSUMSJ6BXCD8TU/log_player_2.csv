"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer is exactly at my maximum budget of $1,500,000, I don't see any potential to save money by negotiating further. Additionally, buying from John would cost the same amount. Therefore, I might as well accept Alice's offer to avoid any potential hassle or risk of the product's price increasing in future negotiations.
