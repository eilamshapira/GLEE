"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's guaranteed price ($1,000,000). It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer when I can either try to negotiate for a better price or buy from John at a lower price. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

Rationale: I'll start with a counteroffer of $800,000, which is:
1. Below John's price of $1,000,000 (giving me room to negotiate up if needed)
2. A reasonable starting point that shows I'm serious but also leaves room for negotiation
3. Significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, signaling that her first price was too high
4. Still a substantial amount that could be profitable for Alice

If Alice rejects this, I can gradually increase my offer in subsequent rounds while still staying below the $1,000,000 ceiling I have from John's alternative offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: While Alice has reduced her price from $1.5M to $1.2M, showing she's willing to negotiate, this price is still above John's guaranteed offer of $1M. There's no reason to accept a price that's higher than my alternative option. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round, perhaps meeting somewhere in the middle between my previous offer of $800K and John's price of $1M."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 900000}

Rationale: I'm increasing my offer from $800,000 to $900,000 which:
1. Shows good faith by moving significantly up from my previous offer
2. Still stays below John's price of $1,000,000, giving me a better deal if accepted
3. Splits the difference between my last offer ($800,000) and John's price ($1,000,000)
4. Signals to Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but won't go above $1,000,000 (since that's my alternative option)

If Alice rejects this offer, I still have several rounds to negotiate, but I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000 if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Rationale: At this point, I'm choosing to buy from John because:
1. Alice's latest offer ($1.1M) is still above John's price ($1M)
2. While Alice has been gradually lowering her price (from $1.5M to $1.2M to $1.1M), she's still not matching or beating John's price
3. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Alice seems reluctant to go below $1.1M
4. John's offer of $1M is guaranteed and is better than Alice's current offer
5. There's no point in continuing negotiations when we have a better alternative readily available

It's time to take the guaranteed better deal from John rather than continue negotiating with Alice when she's still above our alternative option."
