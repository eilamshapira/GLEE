"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand it's a bit high, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This still gives me a fair profit, and I believe it's a good price for such a great product. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit high for me. Could we meet in the middle at $90? I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
