"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you the opportunity to acquire this one-of-a-kind product. Given its unique characteristics and the current market, I'm offering it to you for: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Reasoning: Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value ($800,000) and also higher than John's guaranteed price ($800,000). Since I can't make a profit by buying at $1,500,000, and John's offer exactly matches my maximum budget, it's best to take John's offer immediately rather than enter into a potentially lengthy negotiation with Alice, especially since her initial offer is so far above my target price."
