Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $800,000 to Bob
2. I won't accept less than $800,000 (my reservation price)
3. If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for $800,000
4. Since Bob values it at $800,000, he won't pay more than that
5. If I ask for $800,000, Bob should be indifferent between accepting and rejecting

Given this analysis, I should offer exactly $800,000. There's no benefit in asking for more (Bob will reject), and no reason to ask for less (I'm guaranteed $800,000 from John).
