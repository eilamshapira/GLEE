"Hi Alice! Thank you for your offer. I appreciate the qualities of the product, but given the current market conditions, I'm considering a price of $900000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects both our interests. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're considering market conditions, but I need to account for the true value of this product. It's worth $1500000 to you, which represents significant value. While I'm willing to come down from my initial price, $900000 is too close to my minimum threshold. I can offer it to you for $1150000, which still provides you with $350000 in value. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer and represents a fair middle ground for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. To move our negotiations forward, I'm prepared to meet you in the middle somewhat. How about $1000000 for the product? This price point acknowledges the value on both sides while keeping it beneficial for us. Please let me know if we can agree on this.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your movement on the price and your willingness to negotiate. We're getting closer to an agreement. Given that this product will provide you with $1500000 in value, I believe a fair price would be $1100000. This still allows you to realize $400000 in value while giving me a reasonable return on my product. This represents my best attempt to meet you in the middle, considering our starting positions and the true value at stake.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
