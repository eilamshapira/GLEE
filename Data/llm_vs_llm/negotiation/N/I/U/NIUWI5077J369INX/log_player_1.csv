Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! Thank you for your offer. I appreciate the qualities of the product, but given the current market conditions, I'm considering a price of $900000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects both our interests. Let me know your thoughts.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're considering market conditions, but I need to account for the true value of this product. It's worth $1,500,000 to you, which represents significant value. While I'm willing to come down from my initial price, $900,000 is too close to my minimum threshold. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000, which still provides you with $350,000 in value. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer and represents a fair middle ground for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. To move our negotiations forward, I'm prepared to meet you in the middle somewhat. How about $1000000 for the product?

Given that this product will provide you with $1,500,000 in value, I believe a fair price would be $1,100,000.
