Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're considering market conditions, but I need to account for the true value of this product. It's worth $1500000 to you, which represents significant value. While I'm willing to come down from my initial price, $900000 is too close to my minimum threshold. I can offer it to you for $1150000, which still provides you with $350000 in value. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer and represents a fair middle ground for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

Please let me know if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your movement on the price and your willingness to negotiate. We're getting closer to an agreement. Given that this product will provide you with $1500000 in value, I believe a fair price would be $1100000. This still allows you to realize $400000 in value while giving me a reasonable return on my product. This represents my best attempt to meet you in the middle, considering our starting positions and the true value at stake.
