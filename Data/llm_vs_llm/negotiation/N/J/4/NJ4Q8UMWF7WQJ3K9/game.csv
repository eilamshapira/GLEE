"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to lower it to $13000 as a special offer for you. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13000 is still more than I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $9000? ",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're interested in finding a middle ground. I can go down to $11000, which is a significant discount but still reflects the product's true value. Let me know if this works for you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still quite a ways off from that number.  To be honest, $8000 is the absolute highest I could go.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to keep the price down. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10000. This is the lowest I can go while still feeling it's a fair deal. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
