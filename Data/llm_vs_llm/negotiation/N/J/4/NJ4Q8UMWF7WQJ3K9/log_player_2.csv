Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're interested in finding a middle ground. I can go down to $11000, which is a significant discount but still reflects the product's true value. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to keep the price down. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10000. This is the lowest I can go while still feeling it's a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000.  It's better to secure the product at John's $8,000 price rather than risk Alice not budging further."
