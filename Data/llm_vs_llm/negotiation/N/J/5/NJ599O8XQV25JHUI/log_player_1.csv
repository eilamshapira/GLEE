Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer Bob for my product. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll sell to John for $80, so my minimum acceptable price is $80.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I should offer a price high enough to maximize my profit but not so high that Bob will certainly reject it. I'll set a reasonable markup above my minimum value.
