Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this:
- The product is worth $120 to Bob
- I won't accept less than $80 (as I can sell to John for that)
- Bob knows I have this alternative option
- I'll start high but not so high that Bob immediately rejects

{""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this:
- Bob's offer of $100 is reasonable, giving me a $20 profit over my alternative ($80 from John)
- If I reject and counter, there's a risk Bob might lower his offer or walk away
- $100 is fairly close to my initial ask of $110
- It's significantly better than my fallback option with John

Given these factors, I'll accept Bob's offer.
