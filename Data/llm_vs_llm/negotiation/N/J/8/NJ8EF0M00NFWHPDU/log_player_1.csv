Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $1,200,000, which represents excellent value given its quality and potential. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget, I'm willing to pay $800000 for this product. I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""message"": ""I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. The price of $800,000 is my absolute minimum, and I know this product has higher value."", ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a new counteroffer to Bob with a lower price than my initial offer but still above my minimum value.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is too low for this product's value. I can offer it to you for $1,000,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
