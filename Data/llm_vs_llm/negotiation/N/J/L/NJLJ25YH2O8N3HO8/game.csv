"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2500000. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm open to negotiations if you have a different valuation in mind.",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand that you believe the product has exceptional value, but my budget for this product is limited. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600000, considering the product's value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $600000 is too low for me to consider. Given the product's value, I'm willing to make a concession and lower my price to $2200000. I hope this is more in line with your expectations.",2200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2200000 is still out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer, considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate the increase, but I'm afraid $700000 is still not sufficient for me to consider. Given the product's value, I'm willing to make another concession and lower my price to $2000000. I hope this is more in line with your expectations.",2000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the further concession, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to meet my budget. However, $2000000 is still significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000, which is my highest offer so far, considering the product's value to me and the alternative option of buying from John for $800000.",750000.0,Bob,6,
