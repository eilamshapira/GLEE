"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1500000 is actually the same price I can get from another seller, John. Since I'd prefer to do business with you, I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product. This would save me some money while still providing you with a substantial sale. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer of $1200000, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I value it highly and can offer it to you for $1350000. I believe this is a fair price considering its uniqueness. Let me know your thoughts!",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. Your product is certainly of interest to me, but I've been comparing with similar offerings on the market. I can go up to $1275000, which I believe is fair and would allow us both to close this deal quickly. What do you say?",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your follow-up offer of $1275000, Bob. I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To find a middle ground, I can propose a price of $1325000. This offers great value for such a unique product. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. Your product is definitely valuable, but I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. I can offer $1300000, which is a $25000 increase from my previous offer. This seems like a fair compromise that would work well for both of us. Are you able to accept this price?",1300000.0,Bob,6,

"Thanks for your offer of $1300000, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I believe we can get a bit closer to the value of the product. How about we settle on $1310000? I think it's a fair compromise for both sides. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1310000.0,Alice,7,
