"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm offering it to you at the price of $1500000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she is offering to sell the product to me for $1,500,000. This is exactly the same price that John is willing to sell it for, and also exactly the maximum value the product is worth to me.

Since Alice's price doesn't provide any savings compared to John's price, and there's no guarantee that we'll reach a better deal in further negotiations, I should try to negotiate with Alice to see if I can get a better price.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,500,000 is actually the same price I can get from another seller, John. Since I'd prefer to do business with you, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This would save me some money while still providing you with a substantial sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer of $1200000, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I value it highly and can offer it to you for $1350000. I believe this is a fair price considering its uniqueness. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a good development. Alice has reduced her offer from $1,500,000 to $1,350,000, which is $150,000 less than John's price and my maximum valuation. This is a significant savings, but I should try to negotiate further to see if I can get an even better deal.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that.

We're making good progress in the negotiation, and Alice seems willing to find a middle ground. Since we still have several rounds left for negotiation, I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet closer to the middle.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. Your product is definitely valuable, but I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. I can offer $1,300,000, which is a $25,000 increase from my previous offer. This seems like a fair compromise that would work well for both of us. Are you able to accept this price?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer of $1300000, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I believe we can get a bit closer to the value of the product. How about we settle on $1310000? I think it's a fair compromise for both sides. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

We're getting very close now, with just a $10,000 difference between our offers. This is a good deal that saves me a significant amount of money compared to buying from John. Since we've been negotiating in good faith and the difference is now quite small, I'll accept this offer.
