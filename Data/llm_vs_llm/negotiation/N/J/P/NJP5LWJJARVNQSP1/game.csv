"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $14500 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to buy it for $10000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $10000 is too low considering the product's value. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $13750.",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  $13750 is still a little more than I'd like to spend.  Would you consider $11500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! $11500 is still a bit below my minimum. I can come down a little more to $13250. This is a significant reduction and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",13250.0,Alice,5,

Thanks Alice. I'm definitely seeing the value here.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12375?,12375.0,Bob,6,
