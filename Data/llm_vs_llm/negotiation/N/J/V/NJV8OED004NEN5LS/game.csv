"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is significantly above my budget for this product. Given market conditions and my research, I would be willing to pay $12000 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand you have budget considerations, $12000 is below what I can accept for this product. Given its quality and value, I'm willing to come down to $18000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This product is worth at least $15000 to me, so I cannot go below that threshold. Would you consider meeting me at $18000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
