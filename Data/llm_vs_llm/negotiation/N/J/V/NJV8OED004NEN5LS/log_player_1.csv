"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a product that I believe would be a great addition to your assets. It's a high-quality item with excellent value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is significantly above my budget for this product. Given market conditions and my research, I would be willing to pay $12000 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand you have budget considerations, $12,000 is below what I can accept for this product. Given its quality and value, I'm willing to come down to $18,000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This product is worth at least $15,000 to me, so I cannot go below that threshold. Would you consider meeting me at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
