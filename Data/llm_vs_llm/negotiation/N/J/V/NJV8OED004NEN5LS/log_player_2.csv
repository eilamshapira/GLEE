"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a product that I believe would be a great addition to your assets. It's a high-quality item with excellent value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a competitive price considering the product's quality and market value. Would you be interested in this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I should reject this offer because $20,000 is above both my maximum valuation ($15,000) and John's alternative price ($15,000). I can try to negotiate with Alice for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's well below Alice's initial $20,000 offer but also leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20,000 is significantly above my budget for this product. Given market conditions and my research, I would be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand you have budget considerations, $12000 is below what I can accept for this product. Given its quality and value, I'm willing to come down to $18000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This product is worth at least $15000 to me, so I cannot go below that threshold. Would you consider meeting me at $18000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has revealed that the product is worth $15,000 to her, and she won't go below that. Since John is offering the product at $15,000, and Alice won't go below that price (based on her message), there's no point in continuing negotiations with Alice. The best option is to buy from John at $15,000.
