"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll see great value in it.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me evaluate this offer:

Alice is offering the product for $950,000.
The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me.
If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $1,000,000.

Alice's offer saves me $50,000 compared to buying from John. Since I need the product anyway and Alice's price is below my maximum value, it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer.
