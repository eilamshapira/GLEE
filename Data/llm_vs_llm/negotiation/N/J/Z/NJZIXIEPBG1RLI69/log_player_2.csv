"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price of $120 is too high since it's more than my maximum value of $80. I can either buy from John for $80 or try to negotiate with Alice for a better price. Since I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

I'll offer $70, which is below Alice's cost of $80. This gives room for negotiation, and even if Alice counters with a higher price, we might be able to meet somewhere in the middle. If the negotiation doesn't work out, I can still buy from John at $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $110 is still well above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). Since I still have 7 more rounds to negotiate and can always fall back on John's offer, I'll reject this offer and try another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 75}

I'll increase my offer slightly to $75. This is still below Alice's cost of $80, but shows I'm willing to move up from my previous offer. However, I know I can always buy from John at $80, so there's no reason for me to offer more than that. If Alice continues to reject reasonable offers, I can always take John's option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a reasonable price. She started at $120, then $110, and now $105 - all well above my maximum value of $80. Her small decrements suggest she won't reach $80 or below even with several more rounds of negotiation. Since John is offering the product at $80, which is equal to my maximum value, it's best to end the negotiation with Alice and take John's offer. This guarantees I get the product at my maximum acceptable price without wasting more time on negotiations that are unlikely to succeed."
