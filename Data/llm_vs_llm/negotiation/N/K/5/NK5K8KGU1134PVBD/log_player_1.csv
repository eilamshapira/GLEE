Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm delighted to offer you the opportunity to acquire this unique product. Considering its exceptional qualities, I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the qualities of the product, but my budget is somewhat limited. I'm willing to offer $500000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $500,000, which is significantly below my minimum value of $1,200,000, I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $500,000 is significantly below the product's true value and my minimum acceptable price. However, I am willing to come down from my initial offer. How about $1,700,000?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you, Alice, for the revised offer. I understand you value the product highly. Given my budget constraints and other options available to me, I can offer $600000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer of $600,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. At this point, I need to consider the risk of further negotiation and Bob potentially offering an even lower price, or the negotiation failing altogether. Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, I will take that offer.
