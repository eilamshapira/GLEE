"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $250 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. I can get a similar product elsewhere for $150. I would be willing to offer $120 for your product. Let me know if this works for you.",120.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $120 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to lower my price to $200, which is a significant discount from my original offer. Let me know if this works for you.",200.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $180? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I can't go above $150 as that's the market price I can get elsewhere. Given that, I'd like to offer $135 for your product. This would still give you a quick sale without me having to look elsewhere.",135.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about the market price. However, $135 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to go down to $165, which is very close to your maximum and still allows me to cover my costs. Let me know if this works for you.",165.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're close to finding a mutually beneficial price. I can come down to $160, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer and very close to your budget. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",160.0,Alice,5,
