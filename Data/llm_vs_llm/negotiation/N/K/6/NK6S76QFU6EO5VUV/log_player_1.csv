"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $250 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. I can get a similar product elsewhere for $150. I would be willing to offer $120 for your product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $120 is below my minimum acceptable price.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $180? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 180}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I can't go above $150 as that's the market price I can get elsewhere. Given that, I'd like to offer $135 for your product. This would still give you a quick sale without me having to look elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about the market price. However, $135 is still below what I can accept.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand we're close to finding a mutually beneficial price.
