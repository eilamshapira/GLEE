Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $60 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I have the option to sell to John for $120, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I will also not sell to John yet, as I want to try to negotiate a better price with Bob.

My decision is to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $60, I will make a counteroffer that is still close to my desired price, but slightly lower to show that I'm willing to negotiate.

I will reject Bob's offer again and try to negotiate further. Maybe Bob will be willing to increase his offer even more.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's last offer was $70, and I previously offered $115, I will try to meet him halfway. I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous one, to show that I'm willing to compromise.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer of $75 is still quite far from my minimum acceptable price, and I have a better option with John. At this point, I don't see a strong reason to continue negotiating with Bob, as the gap between our prices is still significant.

I think it's time to consider selling to John, who has been waiting with a better offer.
