"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1150000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. How about we settle for $1050000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $1050000 is below our minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer. How about we settle at $1100000? This price reflects the high value of the product and is still a significant discount from my first proposal.",1100000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. How about $1075000? This offer is a significant concession from my side and reflects my desire to close this deal with you.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. How about $1060000? I think this is a reasonable offer that reflects both our interests. Looking forward to hearing what you think.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, thank you for your offer. While I'm eager to close this deal with you, $1060000 is still below what I can accept. Let's try to meet closer to the middle. How about we settle at $1065000? This price is a small step down from my last offer and reflects my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.",1065000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I need to push a bit further to meet my minimum requirements. How about we settle at $1067500? This price is just a slight increase from my last offer and demonstrates my flexibility while still valuing the product appropriately.",1067500.0,Alice,5,
