"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",8000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $13500. This price reflects the high value and quality of the product. Let me know what you think!",,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I need to stick to a price that reflects the product's worth. I'm willing to lower the price further to $12250. This is the best I can do while maintaining the product's value. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",12250.0,Alice,5,
