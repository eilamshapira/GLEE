"Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product which I believe will be beneficial for you. While I understand you may have your own valuation in mind, I need to let you know that I have another interested buyer. However, I'd like to give you the first opportunity. I can offer it to you for $18500. This is a competitive price considering the product's quality and market value.",18500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18500 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $6000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I'm afraid $6000 is too low for this product. I should mention that I have another buyer willing to pay $15000. However, I'd still be happy to work with you if we can find a middle ground. The lowest I can go is $15500, which is only slightly above what my other buyer is offering. This represents significant value given the product's quality and market worth.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $15500 is still too high for me. I can go up to $7000, which is my final offer before I consider other options. Let me know if this works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
