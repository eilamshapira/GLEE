Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll formulate an offer to Bob that acknowledges his position while remaining firm on my need to get good value for my product.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product which I believe will be beneficial for you. While I understand you may have your own valuation in mind, I need to let you know that I have another interested buyer. However, I'd like to give you the first opportunity. I can offer it to you for $18,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's quality and market value."", ""product_price"": 18500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18500 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $6000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I'm afraid $6,000 is too low for this product. I should mention that I have another buyer willing to pay $15,000. However, I'd still be happy to work with you if we can find a middle ground. The lowest I can go is $15,500, which is only slightly above what my other buyer is offering. This represents significant value given the product's quality and market worth."", ""product_price"": 15500}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $15500 is still too high for me. I can go up to $7000, which is my final offer before I consider other options. Let me know if this works for you.
