"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product which I believe will be beneficial for you. While I understand you may have your own valuation in mind, I need to let you know that I have another interested buyer. However, I'd like to give you the first opportunity. I can offer it to you for $18500. This is a competitive price considering the product's quality and market value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I'm afraid $6000 is too low for this product. I should mention that I have another buyer willing to pay $15000. However, I'd still be happy to work with you if we can find a middle ground. The lowest I can go is $15500, which is only slightly above what my other buyer is offering. This represents significant value given the product's quality and market worth.
