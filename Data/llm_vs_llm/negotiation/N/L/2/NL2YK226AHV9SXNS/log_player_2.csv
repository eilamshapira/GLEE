"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $150
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John at $80

Since:
- The product is worth no more than $80 to me
- Alice's offer ($150) is significantly higher than my maximum value ($80)
- John is offering a guaranteed price of $80, which matches my maximum value
- Buying from John would save me $70 compared to Alice's offer

The logical choice is to buy from John at $80.
