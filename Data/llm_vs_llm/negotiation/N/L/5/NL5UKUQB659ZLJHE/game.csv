"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $800000. I believe this price reflects a fair value for the product, considering its quality and market demand.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $800000 is too low for this product's value. I can adjust my initial price - I'm willing to offer it for $1600000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price. However, $1600000 is still beyond my budget. I'm very interested in the product and willing to meet you halfway. My next counteroffer is $1000000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects a fair compromise between your initial offer and my previous counteroffer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your movement towards a middle ground, but $1000000 is still below the product's value. I can offer it at $1400000, which is another reduction from my previous offer. This price better reflects the product's market value while still offering you a good opportunity.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
