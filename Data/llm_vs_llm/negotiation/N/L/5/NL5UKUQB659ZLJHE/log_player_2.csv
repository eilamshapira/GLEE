"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $2000000, which represents its excellent quality and market value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since the offered price of $2,000,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,200,000, it would be illogical to accept the offer. Buying from John for $1,200,000 is an option, but I'd like to try negotiating with Alice first to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range to initiate negotiations. Since my maximum budget is $1,200,000, I'll offer a price that is substantially lower to leave room for potential future negotiations.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. I believe this price reflects a fair value for the product, considering its quality and market demand."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $800000 is too low for this product's value. I can adjust my initial price - I'm willing to offer it for $1600000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced the price from $2,000,000 to $1,600,000, which shows she is willing to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. Since there's a significant gap between Alice's offer and my budget, and considering I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, I will reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer. This time, I'll increase my offer slightly to demonstrate my seriousness about purchasing the product and to encourage further negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I will send a new counteroffer: 

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price. However, $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm very interested in the product and willing to meet you halfway. My next counteroffer is $1,000,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects a fair compromise between your initial offer and my previous counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your movement towards a middle ground, but $1000000 is still below the product's value. I can offer it at $1400000, which is another reduction from my previous offer. This price better reflects the product's market value while still offering you a good opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced the price again, this time to $1,400,000, which indicates she's willing to continue negotiating. However, this price is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. Given that I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which is below my budget and closer to what I'm willing to pay, I should consider this option seriously.

Since Alice's offer of $1,400,000 exceeds my budget, and I have a viable alternative with John at $1,200,000, I will choose to buy the product from John. This decision is based on staying within my budget and securing the product at a price I'm comfortable with.
