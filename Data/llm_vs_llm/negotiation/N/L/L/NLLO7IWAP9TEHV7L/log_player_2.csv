"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to analyze the options carefully:

1. Alice is offering the product for $15,000
2. If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $15,000
3. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($15,000), and this price equals my maximum valuation, I'm indifferent between options 1 and 3. However, I should reject Alice's offer since it doesn't save me any money compared to buying from John.
