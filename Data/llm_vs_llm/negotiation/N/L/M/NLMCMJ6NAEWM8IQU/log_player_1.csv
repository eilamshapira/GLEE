Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. I'd like to make a counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $9,000 because it's close to my minimum price, but I believe the product is worth more. I'd like to make a counteroffer to see if we can meet at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a lower price, but I still believe the product is worth more than $9,000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for revising your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit short of your price, but I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. Here's my revised counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I accept Bob's offer of $10,000. This price is higher than my initial minimum, and I believe it's a good compromise considering the negotiations. It's also a better option than selling to John for $8,000 or risking further negotiations that might not yield a better price."
