"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I should evaluate whether Alice's offer of $100 is better than buying from John for $150.

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and Alice is offering it for $100, I would save $50 by accepting Alice's offer rather than buying from John.
