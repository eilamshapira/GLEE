"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Considering the options:

*   **(1) Accept Alice's offer:** Buying for $1,100,000 is better than buying from John.
*   **(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round:** This carries some risk. Alice might increase the price, but there's also a chance you could negotiate a lower price. However, given the current offer and my valuation, it's not worth the risk.
*   **(3) Buy the product from John:** This is the worst option, as it costs the most.

Since I can buy the product from Alice for less than my maximum valuation, and it's the most optimal choice.
