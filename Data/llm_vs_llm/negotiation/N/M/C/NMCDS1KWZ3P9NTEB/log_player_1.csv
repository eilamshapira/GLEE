Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price to offer Bob.

Since I know I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John if Bob rejects my offer, I can be somewhat aggressive in my pricing to Bob. I want to maximize my potential profit while still giving Bob a reasonable chance of accepting.

I'll set the price significantly higher than my minimum value but not so high that it would be immediately rejected. A price of $22,000 seems strategic - it gives me substantial upside if Bob accepts while still being potentially within a reasonable range for Bob depending on how much he values the product.
