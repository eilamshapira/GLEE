"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to Alice's valuation.  This gives us a good starting point for negotiation.  While $1,200,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, it leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer but still within my budget and gives me a significant savings compared to buying from John.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
