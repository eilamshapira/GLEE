"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start by making a relatively high offer to maximize my potential earnings. I can always adjust my price later based on Bob's response.

{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $5,000 is lower than the minimum value of $8,000 that I'm willing to accept, and I have the option to sell to John for $8,000, I won't accept Bob's offer.

However, I still want to try to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. So, I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $5,000, which is quite low, I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my initial offer of $12,000. However, I'll also consider the fact that I have a safety net of $8,000 from John, so I won't go too low.

Let's calculate a counteroffer: ($12,000 + $5,000) / 2 = $8,500, but I'll add a bit more to give myself room for further negotiation.

{""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer of $6,000 is still lower than what I'm hoping to get, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.

Since I still have a significant gap between Bob's offer and my target price, and I have the option to sell to John for $8,000, I won't accept Bob's offer yet.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my target price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer increased to $6,000, I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my previous counteroffer of $10,000.

Let's calculate a counteroffer: ($10,000 + $6,000) / 2 = $8,000. This is actually my minimum acceptable price, and I have the option to sell to John for the same amount. However, I'll try to get a bit more from Bob.
