Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, I'm ready to start negotiating with Bob. I want to maximize my profit, so I'll start by making an offer that's hopefully attractive to him but also gives me a good return.

Here's my first offer:

```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, Bob rejected my offer and counter-offered $90. I have three choices now. Selling to John for $80 is the absolute floor for me, and I know Bob values the product at $120. $90 is better than $80, but I think I can do better.

My decision is:

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, let's see if I can get a better deal. Bob is clearly interested since he countered. I'll aim for something in between my first offer and his counteroffer.

Here's my counteroffer:

```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, Bob rejected my offer of $100 and is now offering $95. This is closer to the sweet spot. I still want to push for a slightly higher price if possible. However, I also don't want to risk losing the sale entirely. Selling to John for $80 is always an option, but $95 is a clear improvement.

My decision is:

```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```"
