"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $1,400,000 because:
1. It's still quite high compared to Alice's cost ($1,000,000)
2. I have room to negotiate since my maximum value is $1,500,000
3. Even if negotiations fail, I can still buy from John at $1,500,000
4. I can make a counteroffer that might save me more money"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1150000}

I'm offering $1,150,000 because:
1. It's a reasonable markup from Alice's cost ($1,000,000), giving her a $150,000 profit
2. It's significantly lower than John's price ($1,500,000), giving me room to negotiate upward if needed
3. It's considerably lower than Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000, but not so low as to be insulting
4. Even if Alice counters with a higher price, we have room to meet in the middle and still reach a deal that's better than John's price"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $1,300,000 because:
1. Alice has made a significant reduction from her initial offer ($1,400,000 to $1,300,000)
2. It's $200,000 less than John's price ($1,500,000)
3. While it's higher than my counteroffer, it's a reasonable compromise
4. Continuing to negotiate might risk Alice returning to a higher price or becoming unwilling to negotiate further
5. The deal gives Alice a reasonable profit ($300,000) while still giving me a good price compared to my maximum value"
