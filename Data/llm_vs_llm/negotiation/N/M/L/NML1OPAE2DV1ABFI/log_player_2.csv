"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer ($150) is significantly higher than my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80), it makes no economic sense to accept Alice's offer. John's price matches my maximum value, so that's the best option.
