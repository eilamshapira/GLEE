"Alice, thank you for your offer. After careful consideration, I believe a fair price for both of us would be $900000. I value the quality of your product, but given my budget constraints and market conditions, I feel this is a reasonable starting point for our discussion. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $900000 is significantly below the product's true value. Given that this product would provide substantial value to your business, I'm willing to adjust my initial price to $1150000. This represents a considerable reduction from my first offer and would still allow you to realize significant value from this investment.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
"Alice, thank you for your adjusted offer. I appreciate the reduction, but considering the market alternatives and the value proposition, I'm prepared to offer $1000000 for the product. I believe this reflects a fair balance between our interests. Please let me know if we can agree on this revised price.",1000000.0,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility so far. While I recognize the improvements in your revised figures, I need to stay within a range that aligns with my overall strategy. Given that, I'm prepared to make a final offer of $950000, which I believe is fair and reflects both the value of your product and my budget constraints. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but I believe we're still quite far from a price that reflects the true value this product would bring to your business. Let's meet closer to the middle - I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price point represents a significant discount from my initial offer and would still provide you with excellent return on investment given the product's value to your operations.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. However, after reviewing all factors and considering market alternatives, I'm prepared to make a final offer. I can commit to $1000000 for the product. I believe this figure is fair for both of us and reflects my budget constraints while still recognizing the value you bring. Please let me know if we can settle on this price.",1000000.0,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your patience and willingness to negotiate. I understand the value you see in the product, and I've carefully considered every angle, including my budget and available alternatives. To move forward quickly and decisively, my final offer remains at $1000000. This is the best I can do given the market conditions and my other options. Please let me know if we can close the deal at this price, as Iâ€™m ready to finalize our agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
