"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its high market value and potential returns, I'm offering it at $1,300,000. This price reflects the product's quality and worth, while still leaving room for you to generate significant value."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. After careful consideration, I believe a fair price for both of us would be $900000. I value the quality of your product, but given my budget constraints and market conditions, I feel this is a reasonable starting point for our discussion. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $900,000 is too close to my minimum value ($800,000), and I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. There's still plenty of room for negotiation to reach a better price that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value. Given that this product would provide substantial value to your business, I'm willing to adjust my initial price to $1,150,000. This represents a considerable reduction from my first offer and would still allow you to realize significant value from this investment."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility so far. While I recognize the improvements in your revised figures, I need to stay within a range that aligns with my overall strategy. Given that, I'm prepared to make a final offer of $950000, which I believe is fair and reflects both the value of your product and my budget constraints. Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make another counteroffer. While Bob has increased his offer slightly, there's still significant room for negotiation given that the product is worth $1,500,000 to him. His characterization of this as a ""final offer"" seems like a negotiation tactic, and I believe we can still find a better middle ground that benefits both parties."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but I believe we're still quite far from a price that reflects the true value this product would bring to your business. Let's meet closer to the middle - I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price point represents a significant discount from my initial offer and would still provide you with excellent return on investment given the product's value to your operations."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I truly appreciate your patience and willingness to negotiate. I understand the value you see in the product, and I've carefully considered every angle, including my budget and available alternatives. To move forward quickly and decisively, my final offer remains at $1000000. This is the best I can do given the market conditions and my other options. Please let me know if we can close the deal at this price, as Iâ€™m ready to finalize our agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,000,000. While it's still below what I initially hoped for, it's a reasonable compromise that provides good value for both parties. It's $200,000 better than my alternative option with John, and given that we're already in round 6, there's a risk that prolonging the negotiation further might lead Bob to walk away. This price represents a fair middle ground between my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000)."
