"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I believe $11500 is quite high. Given market conditions, I would be willing to purchase it for $8800. This represents a fair profit margin for you while being a reasonable price for me.",8800.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a price that's closer to the product's true value. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer.",10150.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving significantly from your initial offer, Alice. While $10150 is better, I think we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. I can increase my offer to $9300, which would provide you with a healthy profit margin while being more aligned with market values.",9300.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. I think we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial price. Considering the product's value and the progress we've made so far, I'm willing to make another adjustment to my price. I'd like to propose a price that's slightly above the midpoint of our current offers.",9800.0,Alice,5,
