Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I believe $11500 is quite high. Given market conditions, I would be willing to purchase it for $8800. This represents a fair profit margin for you while being a reasonable price for me.
