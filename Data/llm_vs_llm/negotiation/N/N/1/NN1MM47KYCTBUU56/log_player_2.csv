"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I believe will bring you great value. After careful consideration, I'm willing to let it go for a price that I think is fair and reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $12,000
2. Alice's initial offer is $11,500
3. I know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice
4. I have John's guaranteed offer at $12,000
5. I have 10 rounds of negotiation available

Alice's initial offer of $11,500 is quite high, considering the product is worth $8,000 to her. There's significant room for negotiation, and with 10 rounds available, I should try to get a better price. While $11,500 is below my maximum ($12,000), I can likely do better by making a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that acknowledges the product's value but starts low enough to leave room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I believe $11,500 is quite high. Given market conditions, I would be willing to purchase it for $8,800. This represents a fair profit margin for you while being a reasonable price for me."", ""product_price"": 8800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a price that's closer to the product's true value. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let's analyze the current situation:

1. Alice's initial offer was $11,500
2. My counteroffer was $8,800
3. Alice has now offered $10,150
4. We still have 7 more potential rounds
5. The product costs Alice $8,000
6. John's offer remains at $12,000

Alice has made a significant move from $11,500 to $10,150, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, knowing the product costs her $8,000, there's still room for a better price. The current offer still gives her a $2,150 profit margin. Since we have several rounds left and John's offer ($12,000) as a backup, it's worth trying to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still maintain room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you moving significantly from your initial offer, Alice. While $10,150 is better, I think we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. I can increase my offer to $9,300, which would provide you with a healthy profit margin while being more aligned with market values."", ""product_price"": 9300}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. I think we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial price. Considering the product's value and the progress we've made so far, I'm willing to make another adjustment to my price. I'd like to propose a price that's slightly above the midpoint of our current offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let's analyze the current situation:

1. Alice has moved from $11,500 → $10,150 → $9,800
2. My offers went from $8,800 → $9,300
3. Current offer is $9,800, giving Alice a $1,800 profit
4. We still have 5 more rounds
5. John's offer remains at $12,000 as backup

Alice has shown consistent willingness to negotiate by making meaningful reductions in price. The current offer of $9,800 is actually quite reasonable:
- It's $2,200 below my maximum value ($12,000)
- It's $2,200 below John's alternative offer
- While Alice still makes a profit, it's a fair one
- Risk of pushing too hard might lead to less favorable outcomes

Given this analysis, and considering we've reached a price point that represents good value for both parties, I think it's wise to accept this offer.
