"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you at a competitive price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer you $8000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since the product is worth no less than $15,000 to me, and Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than that, I will reject his offer. I still have a good alternative with John, who is willing to pay $15,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer. I'll try to negotiate with Bob to see if we can meet at a higher price.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,000. I understand that you're interested in the product, but I'm afraid I need to get a better price for it. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering your offer, I'd like to propose a price of $14,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $14000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9500. This would allow us both to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $9,500 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price, but it's getting closer. However, I still have a better alternative with John, who is willing to pay $15,000. Since Bob's offer is still $5,500 short of my alternative, I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further to see if we can get closer to a mutually beneficial price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $9,500. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I still need to get a better price for the product. Considering your latest offer, I'd like to propose a price of $12,500. This is a further concession from my previous offer, and I believe it's a reasonable price given the product's value. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to go up to $10500.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to look elsewhere.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $10,500 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I have a better alternative with John, who is willing to pay $15,000. Since Bob's offer is still $4,500 short of my alternative, and he's mentioned that he'll need to look elsewhere if I don't meet him at this price, I think it's time to consider selling to John. I don't want to risk losing the deal with John, who is willing to pay a higher price.
