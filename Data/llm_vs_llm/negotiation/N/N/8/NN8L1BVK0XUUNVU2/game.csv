"Thank you for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your counteroffer, but unfortunately, I can't go that low. How about we settle on a price of $1350000? I believe this is a fair value for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate the reduction, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'd like to propose a price of $700000. I believe this is a reasonable offer, considering the market value of similar products.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob! However, I can't sell at that price. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell the product for $1250000. This reflects its true value while still being a competitive offer. Let me know what you think!",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with a price that high. I'd like to propose a price of $750000. This is my highest offer so far, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your patience, Bob! I understand your position, but I still believe the product is worth more. How about this: I can offer it to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm able to accept, and I truly believe it's a worthwhile investment. Please consider it and let me know!",1200000.0,Alice,7,
