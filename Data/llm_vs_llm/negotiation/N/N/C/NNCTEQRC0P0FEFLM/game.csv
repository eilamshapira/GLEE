"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Given market conditions and comparable alternatives, I can offer $7000 for the product. This is a reasonable price that would still give you a decent profit margin.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $7000 is too low for this product. I understand your position, but considering the product's value, I can offer it to you for $13000. This is already a reduction from my initial price.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $13000 is still well above what I can justify spending. Given that I have other options available in the market, I can increase my offer to $7500. This represents a fair middle ground and would still provide you with a reasonable profit.",7500.0,Bob,4,
