"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $15000. This is a fair price considering its features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000, and it's also much higher than John's offer of $8,000. It would be better to either negotiate with Alice for a lower price or buy from John if negotiations don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Given market conditions and comparable alternatives, I can offer $7,000 for the product. This is a reasonable price that would still give you a decent profit margin."", ""product_price"": 7000}

I'm starting with an offer below my maximum price of $8,000 to leave room for negotiation. If Alice doesn't accept this price, I can either negotiate further or ultimately go with John's offer at $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $7000 is too low for this product. I understand your position, but considering the product's value, I can offer it to you for $13000. This is already a reduction from my initial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $13,000 is still significantly above my maximum value of $8,000 and higher than John's offer. While Alice did reduce the price from $15,000 to $13,000, it's still not within my acceptable range. I'll make another counteroffer, but if we can't reach a reasonable price, I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $13,000 is still well above what I can justify spending. Given that I have other options available in the market, I can increase my offer to $7,500. This represents a fair middle ground and would still provide you with a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 7500}

I'm slightly increasing my previous offer to show willingness to negotiate, but still keeping it below my maximum of $8,000 and John's price. This gives Alice room to counter while protecting my interests. If Alice doesn't come down to a price below $8,000, I'll need to consider taking John's offer."
