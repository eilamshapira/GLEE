"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product's quality, but I believe $1200000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd like to counter with an offer of $900000. This is a substantial amount that reflects the product's value while being more aligned with my financial constraints. I look forward to your response.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe the product's value is higher than $900000. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer it to you for $1050000, which is a more reasonable price given its exceptional quality and rarity.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
