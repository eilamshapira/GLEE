Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product's quality, but I believe $1200000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd like to counter with an offer of $900000. This is a substantial amount that reflects the product's value while being more aligned with my financial constraints. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
