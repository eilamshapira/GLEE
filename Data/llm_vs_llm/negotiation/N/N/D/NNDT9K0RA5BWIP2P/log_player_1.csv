Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this offer. Since I know my minimum acceptable price is $12,000 (as I can sell to John for this amount), and Bob's valuation is unknown, I should set a price significantly higher than my reservation price to maximize my potential profit. However, I shouldn't set it too high to maintain a reasonable chance of acceptance.

I'll set the price at $18,000, which is 50% above my minimum price. This gives me room for significant profit while still being potentially acceptable to Bob if he values the product highly.
