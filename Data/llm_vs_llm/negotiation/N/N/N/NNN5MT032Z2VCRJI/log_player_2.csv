"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $950,000 because it's significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's alternative price ($800,000). In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer that's more reasonable and below my maximum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'll offer $700,000, which is $100,000 below John's price. This gives some room for negotiation while still being a reasonable offer considering Alice's cost basis of $800,000. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate upward, or I always have the option to go with John's offer of $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $900,000 as it's still above both my maximum value and John's price of $800,000. Since Alice has moved down from her initial offer of $950,000 to $900,000, there seems to be room for further negotiation. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, but if we can't reach a deal below $800,000, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 750000}

I'll increase my offer to $750,000. This is $50,000 higher than my previous offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying below John's price of $800,000. This offer would save Alice from selling at her cost basis ($800,000) and would save me money compared to buying from John. It's a reasonable middle ground that could benefit both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John for $800,000. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($850,000) is still above John's price ($800,000)
2. After several rounds of negotiation, Alice has only come down to $850,000, which suggests she's unlikely to go below $800,000
3. $800,000 is my maximum value for the product anyway
4. Continuing negotiations would just waste time when I have a guaranteed option at my maximum acceptable price

It's best to take John's offer now rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to result in a better deal."
