"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900000 is too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $1025000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1025000 is still a touch higher than I'd like. Would you be willing to consider $950000? That would make this a very attractive deal for me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but $950000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1000000? This is a fair price that reflects the product's value. It's a win-win for both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
