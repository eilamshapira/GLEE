"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this quality product. Based on its market value and features, I'm offering it to you for $18000. This represents excellent value for the capabilities and benefits you'll receive.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're presenting, $18000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm  interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $10000 at this time. ",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand budget concerns, but I need to be transparent that $10000 is significantly below what I can accept for this product. My acquisition cost alone is $15000, which is the minimum I can sell for to avoid a loss. I can come down to $16500, which is already a substantial reduction from my initial offer. This product delivers excellent value at this price point.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While $16500 is closer, it's still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our needs. ",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I need to be completely honest with you. This product costs me $15000, so anything below that price means I'm taking a loss. I've already received a firm offer from another buyer at exactly $15000. I'd prefer to do business with you, so I can offer you the product at $15500, which is very close to my absolute minimum while giving me just a small margin. I can't go any lower than this without losing money on the transaction.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your situation, and I value our potential partnership.  However, $15500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that lets us both walk away with a positive outcome. ",13000.0,Bob,6,
