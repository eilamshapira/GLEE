{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're presenting, $18,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm  interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time. "", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand budget concerns, but I need to be transparent that $10000 is significantly below what I can accept for this product. My acquisition cost alone is $15000, which is the minimum I can sell for to avoid a loss. I can come down to $16500, which is already a substantial reduction from my initial offer. This product delivers excellent value at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I need to be completely honest with you. This product costs me $15000, so anything below that price means I'm taking a loss. I've already received a firm offer from another buyer at exactly $15000. I'd prefer to do business with you, so I can offer you the product at $15500, which is very close to my absolute minimum while giving me just a small margin. I can't go any lower than this without losing money on the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500.
