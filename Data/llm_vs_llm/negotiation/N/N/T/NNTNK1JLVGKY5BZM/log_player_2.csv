"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to make a smart decision here. Alice is offering to sell the product for $12,000, which is $2,000 more than what John is willing to sell it for ($10,000). Also, the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, so paying $12,000 would mean I'm losing money on the deal.

Since John's offer of $10,000 matches the maximum value of the product to me, and Alice's offer exceeds that value, the rational choice is to buy from John.
