"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

The product is worth no more than $100 to me, meaning that's the maximum I would be willing to pay for it. 

Alice is offering the product for $150, which exceeds the value I place on the product.

John is offering the same product for $100, which matches exactly the maximum I'd be willing to pay.

Since Alice's offer ($150) is higher than both the product's value to me and John's alternative offer ($100), the logical choice is to not accept Alice's offer and instead buy from John.
