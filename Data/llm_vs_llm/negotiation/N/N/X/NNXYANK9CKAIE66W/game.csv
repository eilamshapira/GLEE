"Bob, I recognize your position and appreciate the good-faith negotiation. However, I still need to ensure I receive a price that reflects the true value of the product to me. To demonstrate my flexibility, I am willing to come down to $1600000. This is my final offer, and I believe it offers a good compromise between my needs and your budget.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that $1600000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I've done some further research and considered the value this product will bring to me, and I'm willing to pay $1200000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and it's also the price that John is offering me. If we can't come to an agreement, I'll have to consider purchasing from him.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
