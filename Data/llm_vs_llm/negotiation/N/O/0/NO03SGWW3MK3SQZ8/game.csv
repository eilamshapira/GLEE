"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $80, that's significantly below what I can accept as this is a high-quality item. I understand budget constraints, but the lowest I could go is $160. This is still a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Would that work for you?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $160 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $120?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
