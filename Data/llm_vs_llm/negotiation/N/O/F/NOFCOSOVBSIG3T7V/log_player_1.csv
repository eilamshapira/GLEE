Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18000 is outside my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $5000. This considers my budget constraints while still offering you a reasonable return. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your response, but $5,000 is significantly below the value of this product. My minimum sale price is $15,000, which is already a fair price considering the product's quality and value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but $15000 is still too high for me.  I can go up to $6500.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my serious interest in acquiring the product.  While I understand your position, I do have an alternative option available at $8000, so I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you raising your offer, but I need to be transparent - this product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

This represents a compromise, and I believe itâ€™s a fair price considering I have another option available.  If this doesn't work, I'll likely have to go with the alternative.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the increased offer. However, I must emphasize that I cannot sell below $15,000, as that's the product's minimum value to me. I notice you mentioned having another option at $8,000. Since we're still quite far apart in our negotiation and I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, I think it makes sense for me to sell to my other buyer. Unless you can meet my minimum price of $15,000, I'll need to conclude our negotiation and move forward with my other option."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
