Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your response, but $5000 is significantly below the value of this product. My minimum sale price is $15000, which is already a fair price considering the product's quality and value. I have another potential buyer willing to pay this amount, but I wanted to give you an opportunity first. Could you reconsider your offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my serious interest in acquiring the product.  While I understand your position, I do have an alternative option available at $8,000, so I need to stay within my budget."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you raising your offer, but I need to be transparent - this product is worth at least $15000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price. While I'd prefer to sell to you, I can't go below my minimum value. The lowest I can possibly go is $14000, which still represents a significant value for you. This is truly my best possible offer considering my circumstances. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,500.  This represents a compromise, and I believe itâ€™s a fair price considering I have another option available.  If this doesn't work, I'll likely have to go with the alternative."",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the increased offer. However, I must emphasize that I cannot sell below $15000, as that's the product's minimum value to me. I notice you mentioned having another option at $8000. Since we're still quite far apart in our negotiation and I have a guaranteed buyer at $15000, I think it makes sense for me to sell to my other buyer. Unless you can meet my minimum price of $15000, I'll need to conclude our negotiation and move forward with my other option. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
