"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me think about this strategically:

1. My maximum value for the product is $15,000
2. Alice's current offer is $14,000
3. I know the product is worth $10,000 to Alice
4. I have the option to buy from John at $15,000, but that's more expensive
5. Since Alice's cost is $10,000, there's room for negotiation

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer. There's no reason to accept $14,000 when Alice has such a large profit margin, and definitely no reason to buy from John at a higher price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's cost is $10,000 and she offered $14,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower but still gives her a reasonable profit. I'll offer $11,500, which would give her a $1,500 profit while saving me a significant amount compared to her initial offer and John's price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has lowered her price from $14,000 to $13,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, given that her cost is $10,000, there's still room for a better price. Since she came down by $1,000, it shows she has flexibility in her pricing. I'll reject this offer and try another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down from $14,000 to $13,000, showing willingness to negotiate, and rejected my previous offer of $11,500, I'll try to meet her somewhere in the middle. I'll offer $12,000, which would still give her a $2,000 profit while being a significant improvement for me compared to her current offer.
