"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering you a fantastic product that I'm sure you will love. How about you buy it for $95? It's a great deal and I think you'll really appreciate it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze the options:

1. Alice's offer: $95
2. John's price: $100
3. The product is worth $100 to me

Alice is offering the product for $95, which is $5 less than what John is offering ($100). Since the product is worth $100 to me, and Alice's offer will save me $5 compared to buying from John, it makes economic sense to accept Alice's offer.
