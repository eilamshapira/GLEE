"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I need to be strategic here. The product is worth $10,000 to me, but only $8,000 to Bob. Since I have the option to sell to John for $10,000 at any time, I won't accept anything less than that. I'll start with a higher offer to Bob to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": $12,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $7,000 is below my minimum value of $10,000, and I have the option to sell to John for $10,000 at any time. There's no reason for me to accept an offer lower than what I can get elsewhere, and Bob's starting offer suggests he's not likely to reach my minimum price.
