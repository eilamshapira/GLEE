"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Based on the information provided:

1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $1,200,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $800,000

Since Alice's price ($1,200,000) exceeds both the product's value to me and John's alternative offer, the logical choice is to buy from John and save $400,000.
