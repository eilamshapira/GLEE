"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering you a fantastic product that I believe you will really enjoy. I'm selling it for $150. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Since you can get the product from John for the same price, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer. You have no information about the product to justify paying more."
