"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has tremendous value, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its worth."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I agree it has significant value. However, I believe your initial price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer that reflects the product's worth while also considering my budget. I'd like to propose a price that is more in line with my expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 1200000} 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $800,000 because it's lower than my target price and the product's value to me. I'm making a counteroffer of $1,200,000, which is still below my initial offer but higher than Bob's proposal, to see if we can meet in the middle and close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $800,000. I understand that you're looking for a more affordable option, but I must emphasize that this product is truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure that the price reflects its worth. I'm making a counteroffer that's more reasonable, considering your budget and the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and consider my budget. However, I still believe that $1200000 is a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob's new offer of $1,000,000 matches the price I can get from selling to John, and it's a price that Bob is willing to pay, I'm accepting his offer. This way, I can close the deal with Bob and avoid further negotiations, while still getting a good price for the product."
