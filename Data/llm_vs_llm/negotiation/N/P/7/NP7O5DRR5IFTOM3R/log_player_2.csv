(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer of $200 is higher than my maximum budget of $150, I will reject her offer. I still want to try to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a relatively low offer.

{""product_price"": 120}"

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $180 is still higher than my maximum budget of $150. While it's a step in the right direction, I'm not willing to pay that much. I'll reject her offer again and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer decreased by $20 from $200 to $180, I'll try to meet her halfway and increase my offer by $10 from $120 to $130. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and compromise.

{""product_price"": 130}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $160 is getting closer to my maximum budget of $150, but it's still slightly above it. I'm not willing to pay more than $150, so I'll reject her offer again. Since I'm getting close to my limit, I'll consider making a more aggressive counteroffer to try to bring the price down.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer is now $160, and I'm trying to get as close to $150 as possible, I'll make a counteroffer of $140. This is a bit lower than my previous offer, but it's still a reasonable price. I'm hoping Alice will be willing to meet me at this price or at least come down a bit further.
