"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $12,000 to me (maximum I'm willing to pay)
2. Alice's current offer is $11,500
3. The product is worth $10,000 to Alice
4. John's fixed price is $12,000

Alice's offer of $11,500 is less than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000), but it's still quite high considering Alice's cost is $10,000. There's room for negotiation here, as Alice has a $1,500 margin between her cost ($10,000) and current offer ($11,500).

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. Even if Alice doesn't accept my next counteroffer, I still have John's option as a backup, and Alice knows this.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably between Alice's cost ($10,000) and her current offer ($11,500).

Since Alice needs to make a profit and the product costs her $10,000, I'll offer a price that gives her a decent profit while still saving me money compared to her initial offer and John's price.

{""product_price"": 10800}

This offer:
1. Gives Alice an $800 profit (8% margin)
2. Saves me $1,200 compared to John's price
3. Is $700 less than Alice's initial offer
4. Is reasonable enough that Alice might accept it or counter with a price we can both agree on"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has moved down from $11,500 to $11,200 (a $300 reduction)
2. This shows she's willing to negotiate and has some flexibility
3. The new offer is still $800 higher than my previous counteroffer of $10,800
4. It's still $800 below my maximum value and John's price

While this is movement in the right direction, there's still room for negotiation. Alice has shown willingness to reduce the price, and since her cost is $10,000, there's still margin for further reduction.

I'll reject this offer and try one more round of negotiation. If the next round isn't satisfactory, I can still accept Alice's current offer or go to John as a last resort.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $300 from her initial offer, I should also move up from my previous offer to show good faith in the negotiation. I'll aim for a middle ground between my last offer ($10,800) and her current offer ($11,200).

{""product_price"": 11000}

This counteroffer:
1. Is $200 higher than my previous offer, showing willingness to compromise
2. Still gives me a good $1,000 savings compared to John's price
3. Gives Alice a $1,000 profit (10% margin), which is reasonable
4. Splits the difference between our last positions fairly evenly
5. Shows we're getting closer to a mutually acceptable price"
