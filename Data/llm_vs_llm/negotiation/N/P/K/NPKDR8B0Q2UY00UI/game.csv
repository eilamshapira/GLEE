"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity. I believe this product could be incredibly valuable to you. To start, I'm offering it for $25000.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, $25000 is significantly above my budget. Based on my research and the current market, I value this product at no more than $10000. I understand you may have your own considerations, but I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While $10000 is lower than I'm willing to go, I appreciate you engaging in the negotiation. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $22000.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. However, $22000 is still considerably above what I can justify for this product. John has actually offered me the same product for $15000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can increase my offer to $12000, which I believe is reasonable considering the market value. I hope we can work something out.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12000 is too low for me. Considering John's offer, I'll come down a bit more. How about $20000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go for now.",20000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $20000 is still significantly above what I can pay for this product. As mentioned, John is offering it at $15000, which is actually the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend. To be completely transparent, this product is worth no more than $15000 to me based on my needs and budget. I value building a business relationship with you, so I'm willing to match John's price at $15000. This is the highest I can go while still making this purchase worthwhile for me.",15000.0,Bob,6,
