Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, $25000 is significantly above my budget. Based on my research and the current market, I value this product at no more than $10000. I understand you may have your own considerations, but I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While $10,000 is lower than I'm willing to go, I appreciate you engaging in the negotiation. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $22,000."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. However, $22000 is still considerably above what I can justify for this product. John has actually offered me the same product for $15000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can increase my offer to $12000, which I believe is reasonable considering the market value. I hope we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is too low for me. Considering John's offer, I'll come down a bit more. How about $20,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go for now."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $20000 is still significantly above what I can pay for this product. As mentioned, John is offering it at $15000, which is actually the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend. To be completely transparent, this product is worth no more than $15000 to me based on my needs and budget. I value building a business relationship with you, so I'm willing to match John's price at $15000. This is the highest I can go while still making this purchase worthwhile for me.
