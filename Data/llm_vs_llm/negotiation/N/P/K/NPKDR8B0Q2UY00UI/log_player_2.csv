"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity. I believe this product could be incredibly valuable to you. To start, I'm offering it for $25000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Based on the information provided, Alice's offer is $25,000, which is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($15,000) and John's alternative offer ($15,000). There's no reason to accept this offer as it exceeds what the product is worth to me.

Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum valuation ($15,000), I could buy from him immediately. However, it makes sense to try negotiating with Alice first to potentially get a better price than John's offer.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, $25,000 is significantly above my budget. Based on my research and the current market, I value this product at no more than $10,000. I understand you may have your own considerations, but I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While $10000 is lower than I'm willing to go, I appreciate you engaging in the negotiation. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $22000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $22,000 is still well above my maximum valuation of $15,000 and also above John's alternative offer of $15,000. Alice has only reduced her price by $3,000 from her initial offer, suggesting she may not be willing to come down to my price range quickly.

Since I can always buy from John at $15,000 (which is my maximum valuation anyway), there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. However, $22,000 is still considerably above what I can justify for this product. John has actually offered me the same product for $15,000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can increase my offer to $12,000, which I believe is reasonable considering the market value. I hope we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12000 is too low for me. Considering John's offer, I'll come down a bit more. How about $20000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price to $20,000, which is still $5,000 higher than John's offer of $15,000. Since the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer. 

Alice seems to be coming down in price slowly (from $25,000 to $22,000 to $20,000), but she's still far from matching John's price. At this point, I'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more favorable price, but I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a strong alternative.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $20,000 is still significantly above what I can pay for this product. As mentioned, John is offering it at $15,000, which is actually the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend. To be completely transparent, this product is worth no more than $15,000 to me based on my needs and budget. I value building a business relationship with you, so I'm willing to match John's price at $15,000. This is the highest I can go while still making this purchase worthwhile for me."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
