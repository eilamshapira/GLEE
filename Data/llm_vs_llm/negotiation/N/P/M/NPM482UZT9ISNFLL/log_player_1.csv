Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'd like to start the negotiation at $14,500."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While the product is appealing, I'm hoping to get it closer to my budget. I'd like to offer $13000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $13,000 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($12,000), but lower than my initial offer ($14,500), I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

My counteroffer will be $13,750, which is still lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer. This way, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and compromise, while also trying to get a better price for the product.

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer of $13,750.
