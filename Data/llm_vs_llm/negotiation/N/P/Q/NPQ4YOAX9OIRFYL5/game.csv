"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I can only afford $60. Would you be willing to sell it to me at this price?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is far too low for this product given its quality and market value. While I understand budget constraints, I cannot go below $200 as this would be significantly undervaluing the product. Would you be able to meet me at this price point?",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $200 is still above my budget. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I can offer $80 for the product. Would you be willing to accept this price?",80.0,Bob,4,
