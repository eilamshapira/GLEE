Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $250. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I can only afford $60. Would you be willing to sell it to me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. The $60 offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and even well below what John is willing to pay. I should continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is far too low for this product given its quality and market value. While I understand budget constraints, I cannot go below $200 as this would be significantly undervaluing the product. Would you be able to meet me at this price point?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $200 is still above my budget. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I can offer $80 for the product. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $150. Bob's offers are consistently well below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and his latest increase from $60 to $80 suggests he's likely not going to reach a price point that would be acceptable to me. Since John's offer of $150 is guaranteed and meets my minimum requirement, it's best to take that option rather than continue negotiations that may not lead to a better outcome."
