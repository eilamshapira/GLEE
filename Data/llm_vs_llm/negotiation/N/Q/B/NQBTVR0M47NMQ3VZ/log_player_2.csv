"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a wonderful product to offer you today. This high-quality product is currently valued at $2000000 in the market. However, I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price of $1900000. This product has tremendous potential and will be a valuable asset for your portfolio. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $1,900,000
2. The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me
3. John is willing to sell it for $1,500,000
4. Alice's offer is significantly above both my maximum value and John's price

Since Alice's offer ($1,900,000) is well above my maximum value ($1,500,000) and also higher than John's fixed price ($1,500,000), there's no reason to accept this offer. While I could make a counteroffer, Alice's initial price is so high that it might be more efficient to simply go with John's guaranteed price.
