"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm selling a fantastic product and I would like to offer it to you for $160. I think it's a great value! What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $160
2. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
3. John is offering the same product for $120
4. Alice's cost is $150, so she won't likely accept anything below that

Alice's initial offer of $160 is too high - it's $40 more than my maximum value ($120) and $40 more than John's price. It would be unwise to accept this offer.

While I could make a counteroffer, given that Alice's cost is $150, it's unlikely she'll go below that price, which is still above my maximum value of $120.

John's offer of $120 matches my maximum value, and it's guaranteed. There's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice when I can get the product at my maximum acceptable price right now.
