"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,750,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,200,000, and it's also higher than John's fixed price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement with Alice, I can always buy from John at $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'll start with a relatively low offer of $1,000,000. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice and I have a maximum value of $1,200,000, this gives room for negotiation. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground that works for both of us, while keeping in mind that I always have the option to buy from John at $1,200,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,600,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000). While Alice has reduced her price from the initial $1,750,000, it's still not acceptable. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. If Alice continues to make offers above my maximum value, I can always exercise my option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'll increase my previous offer to $1,100,000. This shows some movement towards meeting in the middle, but still keeps the price well below my maximum value of $1,200,000. Since Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by lowering her price from $1,750,000 to $1,600,000, I'm hoping this increased offer will encourage further negotiation. However, I'm still mindful that I can buy from John at $1,200,000 if Alice's next counter is still too high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

After several rounds of negotiation, it's clear that Alice's offers remain significantly above my maximum value of $1,200,000. While Alice has gradually reduced her price from $1,750,000 to $1,550,000, she's still far from a price I can accept. Since John is offering the product at $1,200,000 (which is exactly my maximum value), and Alice seems unlikely to match or beat this price, the most rational decision is to end the negotiation with Alice and buy from John instead."
