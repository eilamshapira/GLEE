"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you our exclusive product at a special price of $1000000. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Looking at the situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000
2. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $800,000

Since Alice's price ($1,000,000) exceeds the maximum value the product has to me ($800,000), and John offers a better price that matches my valuation, I should buy from John.
