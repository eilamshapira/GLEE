"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this extraordinary product. Given its exceptional value, I am offering it to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $1,000,000 to me (my maximum value)
2. Alice's offer is $950,000
3. John's fixed price is $1,000,000
4. The product costs Alice $800,000

Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is quite high, considering she only paid $800,000. There's significant room for negotiation since her profit margin would be $150,000. Since we have 10 rounds of negotiation, and the price is already lower than John's offer, it's worth trying to negotiate for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but still leaves room for negotiation. Since Alice paid $800,000, I'll start with a price that gives her a modest profit while being significantly better for me than her initial offer.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think $950,000 is too high considering market conditions. I value this product, but I would be more comfortable with a price of $850,000, which still gives you a fair profit margin. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. Given the value this product holds, I'm willing to lower my initial offer slightly to $900000. I believe this is a reasonable price that reflects its true worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let's analyze the situation:

1. Alice has moved down from $950,000 to $900,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. She dropped $50,000 from her initial offer
3. There's still a large profit margin for her ($100,000)
4. We still have 7 more rounds of potential negotiation
5. John's offer of $1,000,000 remains as our backup

Since Alice has shown flexibility by reducing her price, but there's still significant room for negotiation (she's making a $100,000 profit at this price), and we have several rounds left, it's worth continuing to negotiate for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $50,000 from her initial offer, I'll also show some flexibility by moving up from my previous offer of $850,000. This shows good faith in the negotiation while still trying to reach a fair middle ground.

{""message"": ""Thank you for considering my previous offer and lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. To meet you partway, I can increase my offer to $870,000. This gives you a very reasonable profit while being more aligned with my budget. Would you consider this fair?"", ""product_price"": 870000}"
