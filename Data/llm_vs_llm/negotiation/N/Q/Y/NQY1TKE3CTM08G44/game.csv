"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is more than I can spend. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell it to me for exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better deal. Would you consider selling it for $7000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $7000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? That would give you a good price and still allow me to make a decent profit.",8500.0,Alice,3,
