"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is more than I can spend. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell it to me for exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better deal. Would you consider selling it for $7000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $7000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? That would give you a good price and still allow me to make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 8500}
