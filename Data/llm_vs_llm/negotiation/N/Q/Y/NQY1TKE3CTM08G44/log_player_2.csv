"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer of $10,000 is above the maximum amount the product is worth to me ($8,000). Since John is willing to sell me the same product for $8,000, which is equal to my maximum value, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and either make a counteroffer or buy from John directly.

Given that John's price is already at my maximum value threshold, there's no guarantee Alice would accept a lower counteroffer that would benefit me more than John's offer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is more than I can spend. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell it to me for exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better deal. Would you consider selling it for $7,000?"", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $7000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? That would give you a good price and still allow me to make a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's counteroffer of $8,500 is still above the maximum amount the product is worth to me ($8,000) and is also higher than John's offer of $8,000. Since I can get the same product from John at a lower price that is within my value threshold, it makes the most sense to buy from John.
