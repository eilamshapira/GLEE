"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer against my alternatives. Alice is offering the product for $2,500,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum valuation of $1,200,000. It's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $1,200,000.

Given that Alice's initial offer is more than double what the product is worth to me, I should reject this and make a counteroffer.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has only slightly lowered her offer to $2,200,000, which is still well above my maximum valuation of $1,200,000 and John's price. The offer remains unacceptable, so I should continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice only came down slightly from her initial offer, I need to make it clear that her price point is still far from acceptable while moving toward a reasonable middle ground.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $1,950,000, which shows some movement but is still significantly above my maximum valuation and John's price of $1,200,000. Since we still have several rounds left for negotiation and Alice appears to be willing to reduce her price, I should continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly to show willingness to move toward a middle ground, but I need to keep my price below John's alternative.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice continues to lower her price, now offering $1,750,000. While this shows progress, it's still significantly above John's price of $1,200,000, which is my maximum valuation for the product. Since Alice has been consistently moving down in larger increments than I've been moving up, continuing the negotiation seems worthwhile.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has been making larger concessions, so I'll increase my offer more meaningfully to show good faith, but still keep well below John's price to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": $1,100,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's offer has come down to $1,600,000, which is moving closer but is still $400,000 above John's price of $1,200,000. Since John's price represents my maximum valuation and we only have one more round after this, I need to make a decision carefully.

Given that Alice has been consistently reducing her price and we're approaching the end of our negotiation rounds, I'll reject this offer but prepare to make my final best offer in the next round. If we can't reach an agreement, I always have the option to buy from John.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","This is the final round of negotiation, so I need to make my best offer. Since John is willing to sell me the product for $1,200,000, which is my maximum valuation, I'll offer Alice a price slightly below that to give me some benefit from this negotiation.
