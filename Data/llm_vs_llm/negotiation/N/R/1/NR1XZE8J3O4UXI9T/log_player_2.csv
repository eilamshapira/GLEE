"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $9,500
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John at $8,000

Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and Alice's offer ($9,500) is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price, it wouldn't make economic sense to accept Alice's offer. 

John's offer at $8,000 is the better option, as it matches my maximum valuation and is $1,500 less than Alice's offer.
