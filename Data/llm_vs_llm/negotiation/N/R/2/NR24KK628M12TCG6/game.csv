,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. I can offer you the product for $130, which is a significant discount from my original price. Let me know if this works for you.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for the product.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $95 is a reasonable offer, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I can offer you the product for $112.50. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",112.5,Alice,5,
