"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12000.  I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $12,000, which is well above my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $8,000

The logical choice is to reject Alice's offer. However, since John's offer matches my maximum value and is already better than Alice's current offer, it makes more sense to just buy from John rather than enter a potentially lengthy negotiation with Alice.
