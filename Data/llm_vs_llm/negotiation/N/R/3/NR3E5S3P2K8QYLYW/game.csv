"Hello Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $1000000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something of great value. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, that price is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $700000. It's a fair price, considering my budget and the value of this product to me. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $700000 is below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which still offers you great value while being more aligned with our costs. What do you think?",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's find a middle ground. I can offer you the product for $850000. This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer while still respecting the value of the product. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $750000. This is a fair price, considering the value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is still below our minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825000. This price is fair and reflects a significant compromise on our part. What do you say?",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's keep working towards a deal. I can lower the price to $810000. This is a very competitive offer that I believe meets both our needs. What do you think?",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $810000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $780000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while still staying within my financial limits.",780000.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, I see we're getting closer, but $780000 is still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $805000. This is my final offer before considering other options. What do you say?",,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close to finding a solution. My final offer before considering other options is $805000. This price is very competitive and reflects a significant compromise on my part. What do you think?",805000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're close to finding a solution, but $805000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $795000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal.",795000.0,Bob,8,
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal, but $795000 is still below our minimum acceptable price. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase the product for $800000. Therefore, I will be selling the product to him. Thank you for your interest.",,Alice,8,SellToJhon
