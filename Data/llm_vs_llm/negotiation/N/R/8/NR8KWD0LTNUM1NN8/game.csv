"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that $200 might be a bit high for you. However, $120 is a bit low for me. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $160? That way, we both give a little.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $160 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $135? This way, it's closer to the middle and still within my budget.",135.0,Bob,4,
