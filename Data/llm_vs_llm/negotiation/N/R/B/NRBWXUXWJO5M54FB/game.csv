"Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I'm offering for sale. Given its quality and features, I'm pricing it at $25000. This product represents exceptional value and I believe it will serve your needs perfectly. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is beyond my budget. How about we settle for $5000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I'm afraid $5000 is significantly below the product's value. This is a premium item with exceptional quality and features. I understand budget concerns, but I need to maintain its value. I can come down to $22000, which is already a good reduction from my initial offer. The product has a minimum value of $15000 to me, so I cannot go below that threshold.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for coming down in price. I understand your position, but $22000 is still too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $7000? This is closer to what I have budgeted.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your increased offer. However, I must emphasize that this product has a value of at least $15000 to me, which is why I cannot accept offers below this threshold. I understand you have budget constraints, so I'm willing to reduce my price to $19500. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value. If your budget absolutely cannot accommodate a price near the $15000 mark, I'm afraid we may not be able to reach an agreement.",19500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer and understanding. I value your product, but I really can't go higher than $8000 given my situation. I hope you reconsider, as I'm eager to make a deal at this amount.",8000.0,Bob,6,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your revised offer. However, I need to be transparent with you - I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase this product for $15000. This reflects the minimum value I can accept for this item. Given that you've mentioned budget constraints, I'm willing to offer you one final price of $16000, which is just slightly above my minimum acceptable value. This is the absolute lowest I can go while still making this a worthwhile transaction for me. If your budget truly cannot accommodate a price near the $15000 range, I'll need to move forward with the other buyer.",16000.0,Alice,7,
