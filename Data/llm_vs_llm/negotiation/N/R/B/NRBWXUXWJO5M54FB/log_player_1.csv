Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I'm afraid $5,000 is significantly below the product's value. This is a premium item with exceptional quality and features. I understand budget concerns, but I need to maintain its value.

The product has a minimum value of $15,000 to me, so I cannot go below that threshold."", ""product_price"": 22000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your increased offer. However, I must emphasize that this product has a value of at least $15,000 to me, which is why I cannot accept offers below this threshold. I understand you have budget constraints, so I'm willing to reduce my price to $19,500. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value. If your budget absolutely cannot accommodate a price near the $15,000 mark, I'm afraid we may not be able to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 19500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your revised offer. However, I need to be transparent with you - I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase this product for $15,000. This reflects the minimum value I can accept for this item. Given that you've mentioned budget constraints, I'm willing to offer you one final price of $16,000, which is just slightly above my minimum acceptable value. This is the absolute lowest I can go while still making this a worthwhile transaction for me. If your budget truly cannot accommodate a price near the $15,000 range, I'll need to move forward with the other buyer."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
