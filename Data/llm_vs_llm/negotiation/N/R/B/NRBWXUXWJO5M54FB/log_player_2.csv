Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I'm afraid $5000 is significantly below the product's value. This is a premium item with exceptional quality and features. I understand budget concerns, but I need to maintain its value. I can come down to $22000, which is already a good reduction from my initial offer. The product has a minimum value of $15000 to me, so I cannot go below that threshold. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your increased offer. However, I must emphasize that this product has a value of at least $15000 to me, which is why I cannot accept offers below this threshold. I understand you have budget constraints, so I'm willing to reduce my price to $19500. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value. If your budget absolutely cannot accommodate a price near the $15000 mark, I'm afraid we may not be able to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,500

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer and understanding. I value your product, but I really can't go higher than $8,000 given my situation. I hope you reconsider, as I'm eager to make a deal at this amount."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your revised offer. However, I need to be transparent with you - I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase this product for $15000. This reflects the minimum value I can accept for this item. Given that you've mentioned budget constraints, I'm willing to offer you one final price of $16000, which is just slightly above my minimum acceptable value. This is the absolute lowest I can go while still making this a worthwhile transaction for me. If your budget truly cannot accommodate a price near the $15000 range, I'll need to move forward with the other buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
