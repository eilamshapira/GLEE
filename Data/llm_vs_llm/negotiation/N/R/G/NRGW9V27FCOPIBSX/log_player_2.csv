"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's initial offer is $120, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and I also have the option to buy it from John for the same price, I don't see any benefit in accepting Alice's offer without trying to negotiate a better price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in hopes of getting a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, to see if we can negotiate a better price. Let's say I'll offer $90.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has made a new offer of $110, which is $10 lower than her initial offer. This suggests that she is willing to negotiate and may be open to further price reductions.

Since $110 is still below my maximum budget of $120, and I've already made a counteroffer of $90, I'll try to meet Alice halfway between her new offer and my previous counteroffer. Let's calculate the midpoint: ($110 + $90) / 2 = $100.

I'll make a new counteroffer of $100 to see if Alice is willing to accept it.

(Note: I'll reject the current offer and make a new counteroffer in the next step)"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has made another new offer of $105, which is $5 lower than her previous offer of $110. This suggests that she is still willing to negotiate, but the price reductions are getting smaller.

At this point, I'm getting closer to my maximum budget of $120, and Alice's offer of $105 is only $15 away from that. Considering that I can buy the product from John for $120, I think $105 is a reasonable price.

I'll accept Alice's offer of $105, as it's a good compromise and I don't want to risk losing the deal by making another counteroffer.
