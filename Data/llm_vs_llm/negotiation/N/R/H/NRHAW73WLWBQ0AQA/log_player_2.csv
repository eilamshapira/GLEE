"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Looking at Alice's initial offer of $18,000, I need to consider my options carefully.

This price is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000, and it's also higher than John's guaranteed offer of $8,000.

Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible while acquiring the product, and I know I can get it for $8,000 from John, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer. I should either negotiate with Alice to try getting a better price or go with John's option.

I'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate it down in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice that gives us room to negotiate while still trying to get a better price than John's $8,000 offer.

{""product_price"": $5,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price from $18,000 to $15,000, which shows some willingness to negotiate. However, this is still significantly higher than both my maximum value of $8,000 and John's guaranteed offer of $8,000.

Since I can definitely get the product for $8,000 from John, and Alice's current offer is almost double that amount, I should continue negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a better deal than John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer somewhat but still aim to get a better price than John's $8,000 option.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price again to $13,500, which shows she's willing to negotiate further. However, this price is still significantly higher than John's guaranteed offer of $8,000, and it exceeds my maximum value for the product.

Since I can buy the product from John for $8,000, and that's exactly my maximum value for it, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer. I should continue negotiating to see if I can get an even better price from Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
