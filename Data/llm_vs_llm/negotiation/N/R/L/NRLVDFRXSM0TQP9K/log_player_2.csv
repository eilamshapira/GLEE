"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for a price of $120. I know you'll find it incredibly valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $80 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $120
3. John is willing to sell it for $80
4. If I accept Alice's offer, I'll be paying $40 more than what the product is worth to me
5. If I buy from John, I'll pay exactly what the product is worth to me

Since Alice's offer ($120) is significantly higher than both:
- The product's worth to me ($80)
- John's alternative offer ($80)

The rational decision is to buy from John.
