"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $150 to me and I know it's only worth $80 to Bob, I should start with a high but not unreasonable offer. Since I always have the option to sell to John for $150, that's my backup plan. I'll start with a price above Bob's valuation but leaving some room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $70 is well below my minimum value of $150, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $150, there's no reason to accept Bob's low offer or continue negotiating. Bob's maximum value for the product is $80, so he will never offer more than that, which is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
