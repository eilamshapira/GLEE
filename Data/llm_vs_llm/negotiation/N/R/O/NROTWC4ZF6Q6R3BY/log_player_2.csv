"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this premium product to you for $20000. It's an excellent value given its quality and features. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering the product for $20,000, which exceeds the maximum value of $8,000 that the product is worth to you. Since John is willing to sell the same product for exactly $8,000, which matches your maximum valuation, it would be more economical to buy from John rather than accept Alice's significantly higher offer or attempt negotiations that might not reach an acceptable price.
