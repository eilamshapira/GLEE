Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling the product to me. However, I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. The product is certainly valuable, but I'm looking at a price point closer to what the product is worth to you with a reasonable profit margin. I'd like to counter with $1150000, which provides you with a significant profit while giving me more value than your initial offer. This is substantially better than market value and represents a fair deal for both of us.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but I feel we're still quite far apart. The product is indeed valuable to me, but I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. I understand you want a fair return, and I want to offer you a good profit margin above your cost. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1225000, which represents a $225000 profit for you - that's a 22.5% return on your investment. This is a substantial improvement from my previous offer and provides you with a very healthy profit while giving me more value than your current offer. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to work toward a mutually beneficial agreement. Thank you for your latest concession.
