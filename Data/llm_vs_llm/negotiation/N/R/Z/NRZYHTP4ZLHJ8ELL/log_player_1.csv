Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, I believe $140 is a bit steep. Given market conditions, I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product, which would still give you a good profit margin. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
