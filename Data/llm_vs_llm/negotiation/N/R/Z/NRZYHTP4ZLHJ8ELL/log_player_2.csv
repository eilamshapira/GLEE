"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in buying the product. I'm offering it to you for $140, which I believe is a fair price considering its value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. Alice's offer is $140
3. I know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's significant room for negotiation
4. John's price ($150) is my worst-case option

Since Alice's initial offer of $140 is quite high (especially knowing her cost is $80), and there's room for negotiation, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. Even if negotiations fail, I can still buy from John at $150, so I have nothing to lose by negotiating.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, I believe $140 is a bit steep. Given market conditions, I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product, which would still give you a good profit margin. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this updated situation:

1. Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $140 to $120
2. This is a $30 savings compared to John's price of $150
3. While Alice's cost is $80, and there might be room for further negotiation, $120 is a reasonable price
4. There's a risk that if I push too hard, Alice might become less flexible, and I might end up having to pay more

Given that $120 represents a good savings from my maximum value ($150) and from Alice's initial offer ($140), and it's a fair price point in the negotiation, I should accept this offer.
