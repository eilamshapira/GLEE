"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Let me start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer of $550,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 (which I can get from John). There's no reason to accept this low offer when I have a guaranteed better alternative.

However, since we still have several rounds of negotiation left, I'll make a counteroffer rather than immediately selling to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still maintain a price well above my minimum to leave room for negotiation while signaling that I won't go as low as Bob's previous offer.

{""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's new offer of $650,000 is still well below what I can get from John ($800,000). While Bob has increased his offer, showing some willingness to negotiate, the gap is still too large. Since I have a guaranteed better option with John, there's no reason to accept this lower offer.

I'll continue negotiating since we still have several rounds left, but if Bob doesn't make substantial increases in his offers, I may need to consider selling to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price again but still maintain a price above my guaranteed alternative from John, showing willingness to negotiate while protecting my interests.

{""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer of $750,000 is still below what I can get from John ($800,000). While Bob has shown significant movement in his offers (from $550,000 to $650,000 to $750,000), accepting anything less than $800,000 would be irrational since I have a guaranteed offer at that price.

With only 4 rounds remaining and Bob still below my minimum acceptable price, I'm getting concerned about the likelihood of reaching a deal that beats John's offer. However, I'll give Bob one more chance to improve his offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Given that Bob's last offer was $750,000, and we're running out of rounds, I'll lower my price slightly but still keep it above my guaranteed alternative from John.

{""product_price"": 850000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob has now offered exactly the same amount that John is willing to pay ($800,000). Given that:
1. We only have 2 rounds left
2. Bob's pattern of offers suggests he's unlikely to go significantly higher
3. I have no advantage in continuing negotiation when I can get the same amount now
4. There's risk in continuing negotiation as Bob might lower his offer

At this point, it's rational to accept Bob's offer since it matches my guaranteed alternative.
