"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is asking for $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000. Since John is willing to sell me the product for exactly $800,000, Alice's offer would cause me to lose money.

Given that Alice's initial offer is so far above my maximum value, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives us room to negotiate while still being significantly below my maximum price point.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her offer from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this price is still above my maximum value of $800,000 and also above John's guaranteed price of $800,000.

Since Alice's current offer would still cause me to lose money compared to my alternatives, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has come down by $200,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. I'll increase my offer a bit to show good faith while still keeping it well below both my maximum value and John's price.

{""product_price"": $650,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $900,000, which shows continued willingness to negotiate. However, this price is still above John's guaranteed price of $800,000, so accepting it would mean I'm paying $100,000 more than necessary.

Since John's offer is better than Alice's current offer, and we only have 10 rounds total to negotiate, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice is gradually coming down in price. She started at $1,200,000, then $1,000,000, and now $900,000. I'll raise my offer a bit more to show I'm negotiating in good faith, but I'll keep it below John's price of $800,000.

{""product_price"": $750,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $850,000, which is getting closer to John's price of $800,000. However, it's still $50,000 more than what I'd pay if I bought from John.

Since John's offer is still better than Alice's current offer, and we have limited rounds left to negotiate, I'll reject this offer and make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal that's better than John's.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice is gradually coming down in price and we're getting closer. Her last offer was $850,000, which is just $50,000 above John's price. I'll make one final reasonable counteroffer at exactly $800,000, which matches John's price. This gives Alice a clear choice - either match my alternative option or I'll go with John.
