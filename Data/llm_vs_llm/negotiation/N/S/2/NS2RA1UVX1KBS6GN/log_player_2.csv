"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $3,000,000 is far too high, as it's more than double my maximum value of $1,200,000. I can always buy from John at $1,200,000, so there's no reason to accept any offer higher than that. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $800,000. This is significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000, which gives me room to negotiate upward if needed. Since I know my maximum value is $1,200,000, starting at $800,000 gives me a buffer of $400,000 for potential back-and-forth negotiation while ensuring I can still get a better deal than John's offer."
