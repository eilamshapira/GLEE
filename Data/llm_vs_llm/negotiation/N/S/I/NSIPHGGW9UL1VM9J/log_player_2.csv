# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering you a great product that I believe you will find valuable. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the offer from Alice is $150, which is above my budget of $100, I will reject Alice's offer. I can buy the same product from John for $100, which is within my budget.
