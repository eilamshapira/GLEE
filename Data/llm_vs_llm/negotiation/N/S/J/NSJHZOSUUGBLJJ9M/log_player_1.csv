Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $150 to Bob
2. It's worth $120 to me (my minimum)
3. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $120
4. The maximum surplus to split with Bob is $30 ($150 - $120)

I'll offer a price that leaves some surplus for Bob to incentivize him to accept, but still gives me a good profit above my $120 minimum.
