"Hello Bob, thank you for your prompt response and for making a serious offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must admit that $12000 is a bit lower than I had hoped for. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm now offering the product to you for $13000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,
