"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will bring you significant value. After careful consideration, I'm willing to let it go for a price of $14000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. I look forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $14,000. This means there's room for negotiation.
* You're willing to pay a maximum of $15,000, so rejecting her offer and counter-offering is a better strategy than immediately buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity,  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your prompt response and for making a serious offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must admit that $12000 is a bit lower than I had hoped for. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm now offering the product to you for $13000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is now offering the product for $13,000, which is still within your budget and a better deal than buying from John.
* While you could potentially try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't go lower than $13,000.  There's a risk that rejecting her offer could lead to a longer negotiation that might result in you having to pay more or lose the product.

Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a good price within your budget."
