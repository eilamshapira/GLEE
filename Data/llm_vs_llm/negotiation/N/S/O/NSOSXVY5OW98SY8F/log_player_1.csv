Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to lower the price. However, $105 is still above my budget. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to make a serious effort to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80 for the product.

Since Bob's offer of $80 is still lower than what I can get from John ($100), I will choose to sell the product to John instead of continuing the negotiation with Bob."
