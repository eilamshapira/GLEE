Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider this carefully. I know the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, and I have John as a backup buyer at exactly that price. Bob values the product at $8,000, so there's no way for us to reach a deal that benefits both of us - any price below $10,000 would be a loss for me, and any price above $8,000 would be a loss for Bob.

Since I can sell to John for $10,000 at any time, and that matches my minimum value, I should offer Bob a price that ensures I don't lose anything if he accepts, though I expect he'll reject it.
