"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to consider the offers carefully:

Alice is offering the product for $850,000, which is actually $50,000 more than the product is worth to me (since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me).

John is offering the same product for $800,000, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, I should choose the option that costs me less.
