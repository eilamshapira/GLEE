"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. Given its exceptional value, I'm setting the price at $1500000. If you're interested, please let me know and we can finalize the sale. If not, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to make a decision that maximizes my value.

The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, but Alice is offering it for $1,500,000. That would mean I'd be paying $500,000 more than the product's value to me.

John is offering the same product for $1,000,000, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me.

Since Alice's price exceeds the value I place on the product, and I have a guaranteed alternative at a lower price, the rational choice is to buy from John.
