"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its market value and potential, I'm offering it at $1500000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential value to your business. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given the information provided, I can see that:

1. The product is worth at most $1,000,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $1,500,000
3. John is offering the same product for $1,000,000

Since Alice's offer ($1,500,000) exceeds both the product's worth to me and John's offering price, the logical choice is to buy from John instead.
