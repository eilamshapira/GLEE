"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $2000000 is beyond my budget for this product. Considering market conditions and my evaluation, I'd like to offer $800000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is significantly below the product's market value. I have another buyer willing to pay $1500000, but I'm willing to work with you. Given that the product is worth $1000000 to you, I can offer it at $1600000, which is a considerable reduction from my initial price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my situation, Alice. While I understand the value of your offer, my limit remains at $1000000. I can offer $900000 for the product. I believe this could be a fair deal, considering the circumstances.",900000.0,Bob,4,
