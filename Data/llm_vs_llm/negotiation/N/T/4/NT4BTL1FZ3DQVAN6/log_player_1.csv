"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be beneficial for you. Given its unique features and market value, I'm offering it at $2,000,000. This is a premium product with significant value potential."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $2000000 is beyond my budget for this product. Considering market conditions and my evaluation, I'd like to offer $800000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. The price of $800,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and even below the product's value to Bob ($1,000,000). Let me make a more reasonable counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's market value. I have another buyer willing to pay $1,500,000, but I'm willing to work with you. Given that the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, I can offer it at $1,600,000, which is a considerable reduction from my initial price."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my situation, Alice. While I understand the value of your offer, my limit remains at $1000000. I can offer $900000 for the product. I believe this could be a fair deal, considering the circumstances. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offers remain significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and he's indicated his maximum limit is $1,000,000, it's clear we won't reach a mutually beneficial agreement. The best course of action is to accept John's offer of $1,500,000, which meets my minimum price requirement and ensures I receive fair value for the product."
