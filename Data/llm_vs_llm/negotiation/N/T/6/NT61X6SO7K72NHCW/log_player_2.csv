"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Let me analyze this situation:

- The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me (Bob)
- Alice is offering to sell it for $1,200,000
- John is willing to sell the same product for $800,000

Since Alice's offer ($1,200,000) exceeds the maximum value of the product to me ($800,000), and John's offer ($800,000) is exactly at my maximum value, the financially responsible decision is clear.
