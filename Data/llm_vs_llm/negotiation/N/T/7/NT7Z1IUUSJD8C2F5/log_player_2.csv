(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Let's start with a lower counteroffer and see how Alice responds.)

Counteroffer: $3,000

Explanation: Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, I want to start the negotiation at a lower price point and gradually increase it if needed. This way, I can try to save as much money as possible."
