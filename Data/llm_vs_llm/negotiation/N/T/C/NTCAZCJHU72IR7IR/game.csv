"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I have a budget I'm working with. I would like to offer $7000 for the product.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you have a budget to work with, but I cannot accept $7000 as it's below my minimum threshold for this product. The product's value to me is no less than $8000, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, I'm willing to work with you and can reduce my initial asking price. Would you consider $12500? This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer while still accounting for the product's true value.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $12500 is still above my budget. I would like to make a counteroffer of $7500 for the product.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $7500. I appreciate that you've increased your offer, but I must be transparent - I have a firm minimum of $8000 for this product, which happens to be the exact amount another buyer (John) is ready to pay. If we can't reach at least $8000, I'll need to sell to him instead. Given the quality and value of this product, would you be able to meet me at $10000? This would still represent a substantial discount from my initial price and provides you with excellent value.",10000.0,Alice,5,
