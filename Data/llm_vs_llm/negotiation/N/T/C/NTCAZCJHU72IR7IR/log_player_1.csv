Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you have a budget to work with, but I cannot accept $7,000 as it's below my minimum threshold for this product. The product's value to me is no less than $8,000, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, I'm willing to work with you and can reduce my initial asking price. Would you consider $12,500? This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer while still accounting for the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 12500}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $7,500. I appreciate that you've increased your offer, but I must be transparent - I have a firm minimum of $8,000 for this product, which happens to be the exact amount another buyer (John) is ready to pay. If we can't reach at least $8,000, I'll need to sell to him instead. Given the quality and value of this product, would you be able to meet me at $10,000? This would still represent a substantial discount from my initial price and provides you with excellent value."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
