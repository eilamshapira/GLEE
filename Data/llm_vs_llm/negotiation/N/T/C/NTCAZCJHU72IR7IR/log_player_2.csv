Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you have a budget to work with, but I cannot accept $7000 as it's below my minimum threshold for this product. The product's value to me is no less than $8000, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, I'm willing to work with you and can reduce my initial asking price. Would you consider $12500? This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer while still accounting for the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $7500. I appreciate that you've increased your offer, but I must be transparent - I have a firm minimum of $8000 for this product, which happens to be the exact amount another buyer (John) is ready to pay. If we can't reach at least $8000, I'll need to sell to him instead. Given the quality and value of this product, would you be able to meet me at $10000? This would still represent a substantial discount from my initial price and provides you with excellent value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
