Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $1,500,000, I will reject Bob's very low offer and propose a new counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

My counteroffer to Bob: $2,000,000

This lower price shows some flexibility from my initial offer while still maintaining a good profit margin and staying well above my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2,000,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $750,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and it's less than half of what John is offering. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $1,500,000, and Bob's offers are still very far from this amount, it's best to end the negotiation with Bob and take John's offer.
