"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I should buy the product for the lowest possible price. Alice's offer is $150, which is the same as John's offer. I don't know if I can get a better price from Alice through negotiation. Therefore, it is a waste of time to negotiate with Alice.
