Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a good price to offer Bob that he's likely to accept while maximizing my profit.

Bob values the product at $12,000, so any price below that could be acceptable to him. I need to get at least $8,000 since that's my minimum acceptable value, and I have the guaranteed fallback option of selling to John for exactly $8,000.

To maximize my profit while giving Bob some incentive to accept, I'll offer a price that's below Bob's valuation but significantly above my minimum:

{""product_price"": 10500}"
