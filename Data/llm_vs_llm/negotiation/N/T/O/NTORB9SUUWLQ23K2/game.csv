"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you be willing to come down to $12000?  I think that's a fair price considering the product's potential value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $12000 is a good offer, it's a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $13500. How does that sound?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your position, but $13500 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13000. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
