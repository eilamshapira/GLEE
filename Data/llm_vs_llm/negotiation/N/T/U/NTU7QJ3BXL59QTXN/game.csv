"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I can actually get this product elsewhere for much less. I value this product at a much lower price point. Would you consider $6000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you may be able to find similar products elsewhere, but I believe this one has unique qualities that make it worth more. I'm willing to negotiate, but $6000 is too low for me. I can offer you a better price than my initial offer, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's meet in the middle - I can offer it to you for $17500.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $17500 is still far above what I can justify spending. While I understand you believe this product has unique qualities, I have a firm budget constraint and can get a similar product for $8000 from another seller. To be transparent, I cannot go above $8000. Would you consider $6500? This is a genuine offer based on my budget and assessment of the product's value.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your transparency about your budget constraint and the similar product you can get for $8000. However, I still believe my product has unique qualities that justify a higher price. I'm willing to make a significant concession to try to reach a deal with you. I can offer the product to you for $15500, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. If you're unable to meet me at this price, I may need to consider other options.",15500.0,Alice,5,
