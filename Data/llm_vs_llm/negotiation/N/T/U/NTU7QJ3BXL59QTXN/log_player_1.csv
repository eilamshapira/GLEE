"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I can actually get this product elsewhere for much less. I value this product at a much lower price point. Would you consider $6000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $6,000 because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you may be able to find similar products elsewhere, but I believe this one has unique qualities that make it worth more. I'm willing to negotiate, but $6,000 is too low for me. I can offer you a better price than my initial offer, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's meet in the middle - I can offer it to you for $17,500."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $17500 is still far above what I can justify spending. While I understand you believe this product has unique qualities, I have a firm budget constraint and can get a similar product for $8000 from another seller. To be transparent, I cannot go above $8000. Would you consider $6500? This is a genuine offer based on my budget and assessment of the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $6,500 because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Although Bob has been transparent about his budget constraint, I believe the product is worth more. I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer, trying to find a compromise that works for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your transparency about your budget constraint and the similar product you can get for $8,000. However, I still believe my product has unique qualities that justify a higher price. I'm willing to make a significant concession to try to reach a deal with you. I can offer the product to you for $15,500, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. If you're unable to meet me at this price, I may need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
