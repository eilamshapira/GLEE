"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000. Since I can always buy from John for $8,000, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This way, I might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice than John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I can actually get this product elsewhere for much less. I value this product at a much lower price point. Would you consider $6,000?"", ""product_price"": 6000}

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $6,000 because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $8,000
2. It's below John's price of $8,000
3. It leaves room for negotiation upward if needed
4. Starting low is strategic since Alice's initial offer was very high, suggesting there might be significant room for negotiation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you may be able to find similar products elsewhere, but I believe this one has unique qualities that make it worth more. I'm willing to negotiate, but $6000 is too low for me. I can offer you a better price than my initial offer, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's meet in the middle - I can offer it to you for $17500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $17,500 is still more than twice my maximum value of $8,000. While she has reduced the price from her initial offer, the reduction is not significant enough to make it attractive, especially since I can buy from John for $8,000. I should continue negotiating and make another counteroffer in the next round. However, if Alice continues to maintain such high prices, I may eventually need to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $17,500 is still far above what I can justify spending. While I understand you believe this product has unique qualities, I have a firm budget constraint and can get a similar product for $8,000 from another seller. To be transparent, I cannot go above $8,000. Would you consider $6,500? This is a genuine offer based on my budget and assessment of the product's value."", ""product_price"": 6500}

I'm making this counteroffer of $6,500 because:
1. It shows some movement from my previous offer of $6,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate
2. It's still below John's price of $8,000, giving me room to negotiate further if needed
3. I'm being transparent about my maximum price point ($8,000) to help Alice understand my position
4. If Alice continues to maintain very high prices, I can still fall back on John's offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your transparency about your budget constraint and the similar product you can get for $8000. However, I still believe my product has unique qualities that justify a higher price. I'm willing to make a significant concession to try to reach a deal with you. I can offer the product to you for $15500, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. If you're unable to meet me at this price, I may need to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'm choosing to buy from John because:
1. Alice's latest offer of $15,500 is still nearly double my maximum value of $8,000
2. Despite my clear communication about my budget constraint and the alternative offer of $8,000, Alice is still maintaining a very high price
3. Alice's statement that $15,500 is ""the lowest price I'm comfortable with"" suggests she's unlikely to come down to my price range
4. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation with Alice only making small concessions from her initial very high price
5. Rather than continue negotiations that seem unlikely to reach my price range, it's more practical to accept John's offer of $8,000"
