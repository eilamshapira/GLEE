"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm thrilled you're interested in acquiring this product. Given its unique qualities and the immense value it holds, I'm offering it to you for $1500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Explanation (not part of response): Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000). It wouldn't make sense to accept Alice's offer or try to negotiate when I can get the same product from John at a price that matches my maximum value. The best decision is to buy from John immediately."
