"Hello Bob, I'm Alice. I have a premium product that I'm looking to sell. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it to you for $18000. This is a product that combines excellent craftsmanship with superior functionality, making it a worthwhile investment. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm looking to spend no more than $10000. How about we settle at this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $10000 is below my bottom line for this item. The quality and value of this product merits a higher price point. I can come down to $16500, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. This represents excellent value for the quality you'll be receiving. Would this be acceptable to you?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the reduction, $16500 is still quite high for me. I understand the product's value, but my budget is more in the range of $11000. Would you consider this price?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but $11000 is still below what I can accept for this product. I'm willing to meet you partway and offer the product for $15000. This represents a $3000 reduction from my initial offer and fairly reflects the product's true value. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price point.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down further, but $15000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more in the range of $11500. Can we settle at this price?",11500.0,Bob,6,
