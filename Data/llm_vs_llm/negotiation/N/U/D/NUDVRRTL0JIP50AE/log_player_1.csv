Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm looking to spend no more than $10000. How about we settle at this price?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $10,000 is below my bottom line for this item. The quality and value of this product merits a higher price point. I can come down to $16,500, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. This represents excellent value for the quality you'll be receiving. Would this be acceptable to you?"", ""product_price"": 16500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
