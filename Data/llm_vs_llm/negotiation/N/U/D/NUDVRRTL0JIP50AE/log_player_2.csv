Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $10000 is below my bottom line for this item. The quality and value of this product merits a higher price point. I can come down to $16500, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. This represents excellent value for the quality you'll be receiving. Would this be acceptable to you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but $11000 is still below what I can accept for this product. I'm willing to meet you partway and offer the product for $15000. This represents a $3000 reduction from my initial offer and fairly reflects the product's true value. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price point.
