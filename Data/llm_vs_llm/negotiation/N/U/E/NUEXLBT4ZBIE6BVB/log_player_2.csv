"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to analyze this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $8,000, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay for it, as it's worth no more than $8,000 to me. John is also selling the same product for $8,000.

Since Alice values the product at $8,000 (her cost), she has no room to lower the price without taking a loss. I could reject and make a counteroffer, but since the product is worth exactly $8,000 to Alice, she's unlikely to accept any lower price.

Given that both Alice and John are offering the same price ($8,000), and this equals my maximum valuation, there's no advantage to negotiating further or switching to John.
