"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is a bit high for my budget. I can offer $80 for the product. Let me know if that works for you!",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on a price that's more reasonable for both of us?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand where you're coming from, but $120 is still a bit above my budget. I can meet you slightly higher than my initial offer, though. How about $90? I think that's a fair compromise.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Since you've come up from $80 to $90, I'm willing to come down a bit more from $120. Let's try to find a middle ground. I can offer the product for $110, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
