"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is a bit high for my budget. I can offer $80 for the product. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $80 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob or sell it to John for $100 if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on a price that's more reasonable for both of us?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand where you're coming from, but $120 is still a bit above my budget. I can meet you slightly higher than my initial offer, though. How about $90? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Although $90 is getting closer to a price I'd be willing to accept, I still believe I can get a better deal from Bob or sell it to John for $100, which is my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to meet Bob in the middle again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Since you've come up from $80 to $90, I'm willing to come down a bit more from $120. Let's try to find a middle ground. I can offer the product for $110, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
