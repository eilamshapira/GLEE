"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand that the product has exceptional value, but $12000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay a reasonable price, but I need to stay within my means. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a price that reflects the product's true value. Considering this, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $11000. I believe this price is more reasonable, given the product's exceptional worth.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and come down to $11000. However, I'm still looking to get the best possible deal. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9500, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence in trying to find a mutually agreeable price. While $9500 is a reasonable offer, I still believe the product's value warrants a slightly higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and yours. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10250.",10250.0,Alice,5,
