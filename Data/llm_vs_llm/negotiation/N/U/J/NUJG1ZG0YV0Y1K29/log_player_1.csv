"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","While $13,000 is above my minimum threshold of $12,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob since the product is worth $15,000 to him. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial offer but still try to secure a better deal than $13,000.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob has increased his offer by $250, showing he's willing to negotiate upward. However, there might still be room to get a better price. Since his new offer of $13,250 is significantly better than John's $12,000, I'll reject and make one more counteroffer.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob has increased his offer to $13,500, which is a good improvement from his previous offers. While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might get frustrated and walk away. The current offer of $13,500 is significantly better than John's $12,000, and we've made good progress from the initial offers. I'll accept this offer.
