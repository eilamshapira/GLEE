"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since the product is worth $15,000 to me and Alice's offer of $14,500 is lower than that, it's a good deal. However, I want to try to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is close to my maximum budget, but I believe I can negotiate a better price since the product is only worth $12,000 to her.

Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer, hoping to get a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, I'll aim for a price that is closer to that value, but also taking into account that I'm willing to pay up to $15,000.

My counteroffer will be $13,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has lowered her price to $14,000, which is still a bit higher than I was hoping for, but it's getting closer to a reasonable deal. Since I know the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, I believe there's still some room for negotiation.

However, I also need to consider that Alice may not be willing to go much lower, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Additionally, buying from John for $15,000 is still an option, but I'd rather try to get a better deal from Alice.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer, trying to meet her halfway between her current offer and my previous counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","My next counteroffer will be $13,250. I'm trying to slowly bridge the gap between Alice's offer and my target price, while also giving her a chance to consider a more reasonable deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has lowered her price again to $13,750, which is getting very close to my target price range. At this point, I'm starting to feel that the deal is almost reasonable, considering I'm willing to pay up to $15,000.

However, I still think I can get a slightly better deal. Since Alice has already come down from $14,500 to $13,750, I believe she's willing to negotiate further.

I'll reject Alice's offer one more time and make another counteroffer, trying to split the difference between her current offer and my previous counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","My next counteroffer will be $13,500. This price is still lower than Alice's current offer, but it's a reasonable compromise considering the back-and-forth negotiations we've had so far.
