"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. Considering its unique qualities and the interest it has generated, I'm offering it to you for $2000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll analyze this offer:

Alice is offering the product for $2,000,000, which exceeds:
1. The maximum value to me ($1,000,000)
2. The value to Alice ($1,500,000)
3. John's offering price ($1,000,000)

Since Alice's price is double what I value the product at and double what John is offering, this isn't a good deal for me. John's price matches exactly what the product is worth to me, so I should take that option.
