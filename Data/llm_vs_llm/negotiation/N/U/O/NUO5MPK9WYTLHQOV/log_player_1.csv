"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, Bob's offer of $60 is too low. I need to make a decision:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60** - This would result in a loss, as the product is worth no less than $150 to me.
*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer** - This gives me another chance to get a better price.
*   **(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150** - This guarantees me a profit, which is the minimum I need.

I'll choose to see if I can get a better offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, I'll make a counteroffer. I'll try to get a better price this time.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","This is still too low. Let's review the options again:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70** - This is a loss.
*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer** - Risking another counteroffer.
*   **(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150** - Profit guaranteed.

Given the offers so far, I should move on and sell to John.
