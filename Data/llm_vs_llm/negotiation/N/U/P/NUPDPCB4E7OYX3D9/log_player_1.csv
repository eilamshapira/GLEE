"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and also lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($15,000), and considering I have the option to sell it to John for $15,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I am willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Thus, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be $18,000, which is slightly lower than my initial offer, indicating my willingness to negotiate but still reflecting the value I believe the product holds.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's new offer of $10,000 is still below the minimum value I have for the product ($15,000) and also below what I believe it's worth. Since I have the option to sell it to John for $15,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer, I will reject Bob's offer again. However, I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price that is more favorable to me.

My next counteroffer will be $17,000, which is a bit lower than my previous offer, showing that I'm open to finding a middle ground but still aiming to get a good price for the product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below the minimum value I have for the product ($15,000). Given that I have the option to sell the product to John for $15,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's current offer, I will reject Bob's offer again.

At this point, it seems that Bob's offers are not getting close enough to what I consider a fair price for the product, and the gap between his offers and my counteroffers is not narrowing sufficiently. Considering the alternative of selling to John for $15,000, which is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm comfortable with, I will choose to sell the product to John.
