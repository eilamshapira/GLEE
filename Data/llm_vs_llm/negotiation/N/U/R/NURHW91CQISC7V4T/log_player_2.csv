"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will reject this offer because $150 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $80, and it's also higher than John's alternative offer. It makes sense to reject and make a counteroffer to Alice, knowing I can always fall back on John's $80 offer if negotiations with Alice don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 60}

I'll offer $60, which is below John's price of $80. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to John's offer. If Alice accepts, I'll save $20 compared to buying from John. If she counters with a higher price, we can still negotiate as long as it stays below $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer because $135 is still well above both my maximum value ($80) and John's alternative price ($80). There's no reason to accept a price that's $55 higher than my alternative option. I'll make another counteroffer to try to reach a more reasonable price, knowing I can still fall back on John's $80 offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 65}

I'll slightly increase my previous offer to $65. This is still well below John's price of $80, which gives me a good potential savings if Alice accepts. It also shows some movement in the negotiation from my previous offer of $60, while maintaining a strong negotiating position since I have John's $80 offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer because $130 is still significantly higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). While Alice has reduced her price from $150 to $135 to $130, she's still far above the competitive alternative. I'll make another counteroffer, as there's no risk in continuing to negotiate when I have John's $80 offer as a reliable backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

I'll increase my offer to $70, showing continued willingness to negotiate by moving up from my previous offer of $65. This price would still save me $10 compared to John's offer, while giving Alice a better price than my previous offers. If Alice doesn't accept a price near this range, I can always fall back on John's $80 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $80. While Alice has been gradually lowering her price (from $150 to $125), she's still asking $45 more than John's price. The negotiation pattern suggests Alice is unlikely to drop her price below John's $80 offer in any reasonable number of rounds. Since $80 is already my maximum value for the product, and John is offering exactly that price, it makes more sense to end the negotiation and take John's offer rather than continue this back-and-forth."
