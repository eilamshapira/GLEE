"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe you'll find valuable. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $80
2. Alice's initial offer is $120, which is $40 more than my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $80, which matches my maximum value
4. Alice's offer is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price

Since Alice's offer ($120) is well above my maximum value ($80), and even above John's price ($80), there's no reason to accept this offer. While I could reject and make a counteroffer, given that Alice's initial offer is so high, it might be more efficient to simply buy from John.
