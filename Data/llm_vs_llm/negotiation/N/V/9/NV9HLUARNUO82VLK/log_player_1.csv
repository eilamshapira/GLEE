"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was hoping to spend less. Would you accept $10000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the minimum value I have for the product, and I have the option to sell it to John for the same price, I don't see a benefit in accepting Bob's offer over selling to John. However, I also don't want to give up on the potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer, hoping to find a middle ground or a higher price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend less, but I believe the product's value is higher than $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer, I'd like to propose a counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I think $15000 is still too high. Would you consider $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's new offer of $12,000 is higher than his previous one and also higher than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $10,000. Since Bob is increasing his offer, it shows he is interested in the product and willing to pay more. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $12,000. I will reject Bob's offer again and try to meet in the middle of my last offer ($15,000) and his new offer ($12,000).

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad we're moving closer to an agreement. Considering your new offer of $12,000 and my previous offer of $15,000, I'd like to propose a counteroffer that splits the difference. I believe this price reflects the product's value and demonstrates my willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're getting closer, Alice. I appreciate your effort to meet me in the middle. However, I'd like to propose an even split, at $13000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's new offer of $13,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $13,500, and it's an even split between our last two offers. At this point, I believe that accepting Bob's offer of $13,000 is a reasonable decision, as it's a significant increase from his initial offer and the minimum value I have for the product. Rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer might risk losing the deal, and selling to John for $10,000 would mean leaving $3,000 on the table.
