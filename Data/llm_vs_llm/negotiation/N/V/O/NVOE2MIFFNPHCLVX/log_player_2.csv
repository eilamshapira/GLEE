"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this high-quality product. After careful consideration, I've decided to price it at $80, which I believe represents its fair market value. This product has been very popular with other customers, and in fact, I already have another buyer named John who's ready to purchase it at this price. However, I wanted to give you the first opportunity to acquire it. Would you like to proceed with the purchase at $80? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
