"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a fair price. How about $90?  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering the product for $90. The product is worth no more than $100 to me, so this offer is below my maximum value. 

If I reject Alice's offer, my alternative is to buy from John for $100. That would cost me $10 more.

Since Alice's offer ($90) is less than John's price ($100), and below my maximum valuation, accepting Alice's offer would save me money.
