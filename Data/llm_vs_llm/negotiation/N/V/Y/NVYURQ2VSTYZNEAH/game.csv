"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750000. Let me know if that works for you!",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! While I understand your budget constraints, I can't go as low as $750000. However, I'd be willing to sell you the product for $850000. This price is still a great deal compared to its market value. Let me know if this works for you!",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $850000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $800000? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
