Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to set a price that balances the chance of Bob accepting while maximizing my profit. Since I know the product is worth at least $10,000 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, I should offer Bob a price higher than this amount.

Given that I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll set a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value, but not so high that it would immediately be rejected.
