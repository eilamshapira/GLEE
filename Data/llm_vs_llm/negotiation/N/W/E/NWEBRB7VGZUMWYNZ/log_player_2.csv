"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer ($15,000) is higher than both my maximum valuation ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000), it would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. The best decision would be to buy from John for $12,000, as this gives me the product at my maximum acceptable price.
