Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob
2. It's worth $1,000,000 to me
3. If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for $1,000,000

I want to maximize my profit while ensuring Bob might accept. Since Bob values it at $1,200,000, he would theoretically be willing to pay any amount up to that price. However, if I price too close to $1,200,000, he might reject it. I should leave some surplus for Bob to make the deal attractive while still making more than my fallback option with John.

I'll offer it for $1,100,000, which:
- Gives me $100,000 more than my minimum acceptable price
- Leaves $100,000 in value for Bob
- Is a reasonable middle ground between our valuations
