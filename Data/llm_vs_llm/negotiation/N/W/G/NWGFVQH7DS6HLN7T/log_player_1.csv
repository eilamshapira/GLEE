I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum price of $15,000, but still allows me to make a profit. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to pay this price, as it's still a good deal for him, considering the product is worth $8,000 to him."

I'm countering Bob's offer with $10,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and his offer. It's still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $8,000, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."
