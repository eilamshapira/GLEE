"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds immense value, and I believe it could be a perfect fit for your needs.  I'm confident you'll find it incredibly beneficial.  I'm asking for $20000 for it, which is a fair price considering its potential.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $20,000, but it's only worth up to $12,000 to me. John is willing to sell me the same product for $12,000.

Since Alice's price ($20,000) exceeds both the maximum value to me ($12,000) and John's alternative offer ($12,000), the rational decision is to buy from John instead.
