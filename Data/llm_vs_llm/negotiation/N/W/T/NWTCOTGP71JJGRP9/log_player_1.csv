Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll really love. I'm offering it to you for $140."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Okay, considering Bob values the product at $150 and I value it at $100, I want to maximize my profit. $120 is better than $100 (selling to John). I'll try to get a little more if I can.

Therefore, my decision is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your counteroffer. How about we meet in the middle at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down to $130, Alice. I'm still trying to keep within my budget. Could you go a bit lower, maybe to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Okay, let's analyze this again. Bob values the product at $150, and I value it at $100. $110 is better than selling to John for $100. I've already moved down quite a bit. While I'd *like* to get more, I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether. It's time to accept the offer.

Therefore, my decision is:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
