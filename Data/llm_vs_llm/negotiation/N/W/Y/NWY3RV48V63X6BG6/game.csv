,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",50.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,200.0
"Thanks for the interest, Bob. I understand that $250 was a bit high. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $200.",200.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down from $250, but $200 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer, so how about $60? I think that's a fair price for the product.",60.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,180.0
"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here. $60 is just too low for me. Look, I'll come down a bit more. How about $180?",180.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $180 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new offer. How about $120? I think that's a fair compromise.",120.0,Bob,6,,
