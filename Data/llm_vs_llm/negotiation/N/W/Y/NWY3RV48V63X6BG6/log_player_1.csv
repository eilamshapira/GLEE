Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Given Bob's counteroffer of $50, which is significantly below my minimum value, I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the interest, Bob. I understand that $250 was a bit high. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $200."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down from $250, but $200 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer, so how about $60? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's counteroffer of $60 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer_price"": 180}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here. $60 is just too low for me. Look, I'll come down a bit more. How about $180?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $180 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new offer. How about $120? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer of $120 is still below my preferred price. However, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150. At this point, I have to consider whether continuing to negotiate with Bob will result in a higher sale price than selling to John for $150.

Given that the offers have been decreasing rather than increasing, and considering the risk of Bob's final offer being lower than $150, I will choose to sell to John.
