"Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since the price Alice is offering ($160) is higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($150), I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $150, which is within my budget.
