"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than the maximum value of $15,000 that the product is worth to me. Additionally, I know that John is willing to sell me the same product for $15,000, which matches my maximum valuation. There's no reason for me to accept Alice's current offer or to make a counteroffer, as I have a guaranteed option at my maximum acceptable price.
