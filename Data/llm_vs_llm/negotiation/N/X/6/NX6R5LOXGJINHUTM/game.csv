"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $100 is quite low for the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a fair compromise here. $115 is still a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $125? That's my final offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
