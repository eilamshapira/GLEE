"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $1500000 is exactly what I can get it for from another seller. For me to choose your product over theirs, I'd need a better price. I'm willing to offer $1200000 which I believe is fair given market conditions. This gives you a quick sale while allowing me some savings compared to my alternative option.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand you have other options, but I should clarify that this product has unique advantages over comparable alternatives. While I can't match your proposed $1200000, I can meet you partway at $1350000. This price reflects the product's superior quality and long-term value while still offering you savings compared to similar products on the market. Would this work for you?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your product does sound appealing, and I'm definitely interested. However, I'm working within budget constraints and was hoping we could meet in the middle at $1275000. This would give me the justification I need to choose your product over other options, while still reflecting the quality you're offering. Would this price point work for you?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
