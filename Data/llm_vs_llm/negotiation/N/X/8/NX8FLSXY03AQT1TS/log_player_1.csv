Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $1500000 is exactly what I can get it for from another seller. For me to choose your product over theirs, I'd need a better price. I'm willing to offer $1200000 which I believe is fair given market conditions. This gives you a quick sale while allowing me some savings compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
