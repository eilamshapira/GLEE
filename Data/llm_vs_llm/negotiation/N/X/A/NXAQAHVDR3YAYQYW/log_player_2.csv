"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'll analyze this offer:

Alice is offering the product for $2,000,000, which exceeds the maximum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me. Additionally, John is offering the same product for $800,000.

Since Alice's price is significantly higher than both the product's value to me and John's alternative offer, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer or continue negotiating.
