"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully. She's offering the product for $120, which is significantly higher than the $80 maximum value it has to me. Additionally, I have the option to buy it from John for exactly $80.

Since Alice's offer is $40 more than what the product is worth to me, and $40 more than John's price, it makes sense to reject this offer.

Since I can buy the product from John for $80, and that's the maximum value it has to me anyway, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $110.
