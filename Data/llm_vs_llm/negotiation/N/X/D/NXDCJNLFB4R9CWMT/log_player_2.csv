"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $12,000, and also higher than John's guaranteed price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 8000}

I'll start with a relatively low offer of $8,000. This gives room for negotiation while still being a reasonable price that's well below both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000). If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground that's beneficial for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $18,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000). While she has reduced the price from her initial offer, it's still not competitive. I'll reject and make another counteroffer to try to reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 10000}

I'll increase my previous offer to $10,000. This shows I'm willing to move up from my initial offer while still staying below both my maximum value and John's price. It's a reasonable step up from my previous offer of $8,000, showing good faith in the negotiation while maintaining a good margin for potential further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John for $12,000. After several rounds of negotiation, Alice's offers have remained significantly above my maximum value ($12,000) and have only decreased marginally (from $20,000 to $17,500). Given that:
1. Alice's current offer is still $5,500 above John's price
2. Alice's small decrements in price suggest she's unlikely to drop the price below John's offer
3. We've already used half of our negotiation rounds
4. John's price of $12,000 matches my maximum value

It's most rational to take John's guaranteed offer rather than continue negotiations that show little promise of reaching an acceptable price point."
