Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. 

Bob's valuation of the product is unknown to me, but I know I have a guaranteed backup offer of $800,000 from John. Therefore, I should offer the product to Bob at a significantly higher price to maximize my potential profit, while knowing I won't lose anything if he rejects since I have John's offer.

I'll set a price that's notably higher than my minimum threshold, but not so extreme that it would immediately be rejected if Bob values the product highly.
