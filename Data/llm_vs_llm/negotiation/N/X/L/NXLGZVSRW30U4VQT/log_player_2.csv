"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's initial offer of $100 is already below my maximum budget of $150, I'll consider it a good starting point. However, I'd like to try to negotiate a better price to save as much money as possible.

My decision for Round 1 is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send Alice a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I don't know the value of the product to Alice, I'll start by offering a price that is $20 lower than her initial offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $90. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has come down by $10 from her initial offer, which is a good sign. However, I'm still aiming to save as much money as possible. Since Alice's new offer of $90 is still above my initial counteroffer of $80, I'll try to negotiate further.

My decision for Round 3 is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send Alice a counteroffer. I'll meet her halfway between my previous offer and her new offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer of $85. 

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer! I'm getting closer to what I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to sell the product for $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I've already decided on my counteroffer in the previous round. I'll send it to Alice again.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer! I'm getting closer to what I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to sell the product for $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}"
