Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make an offer that maximizes my profit while being attractive enough for Bob to accept. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, I could capture some of that surplus value.

{""product_price"": $1,300,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to decide whether to accept Bob's counteroffer of $1,100,000, make a new counteroffer, or sell to John for $1,000,000.

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is better than my guaranteed option with John ($1,000,000), but it's considerably lower than my initial offer of $1,300,000. Since Bob's valuation is $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation to capture more value.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that moves closer to Bob's position while still trying to capture good value for myself.
