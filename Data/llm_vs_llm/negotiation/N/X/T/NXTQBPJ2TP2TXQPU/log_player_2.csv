"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $1,300,000
2. The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me
3. I know Alice's bottom line is $1,000,000 (her cost)
4. John's fixed price is $1,500,000

Alice's current offer ($1,300,000) is already better than John's price ($1,500,000), but since I know Alice's cost is $1,000,000, there might be room for negotiation. It would be reasonable to try to get a better price by making a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's above Alice's cost ($1,000,000) but significantly lower than her current offer ($1,300,000). This gives room for potential back-and-forth negotiation while still being reasonable.

{""product_price"": 1100000}

This offer:
1. Is $100,000 above Alice's cost, so she could still make a profit
2. Saves me $200,000 compared to her current offer
3. Saves me $400,000 compared to John's price
4. Leaves room for negotiation if Alice counters"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

1. Alice reduced her price from $1,300,000 to $1,225,000 (a $75,000 reduction)
2. This shows she's willing to negotiate and make meaningful concessions
3. The new price is still well below John's price ($1,500,000)
4. While we might get a slightly better price with more negotiation, the risk is that Alice might become frustrated and stop negotiating

Given that:
- Alice has shown significant movement from her initial price
- The current price saves me $275,000 compared to John's option
- Further negotiation might risk the deal for diminishing returns
- This seems like a fair middle ground between her initial offer and my counteroffer
