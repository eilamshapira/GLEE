"Hello Alice, thank you for offering this product. While I appreciate the value it offers, your asking price is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I'd be willing to pay $6000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. While I understand budget constraints, I cannot accept $6000 as it's significantly below my minimum value of $15000. The product has exceptional quality and market value that justifies a higher price. I'm willing to work with you, but my counteroffer is $16000. This is already reduced from my initial offer and represents good value. If this doesn't work for your budget, I understand, as I do have another buyer ready at $15000.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you coming down a bit. To be totally transparent, I've seen similar products in the range of $8000 to $9000, so I need to stay within that ballpark. Would you be willing to meet me at $8000? I'm ready to close the deal today at that price.",8000.0,Bob,4,
