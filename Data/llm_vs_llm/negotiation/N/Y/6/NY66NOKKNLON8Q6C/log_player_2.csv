"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's price ($1,500,000), it doesn't make sense for me to accept it. The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, so I shouldn't pay more than that.

I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, but since I already have a guaranteed option to buy from John at my maximum value, there's no reason to risk continuing negotiations that might not end favorably.
