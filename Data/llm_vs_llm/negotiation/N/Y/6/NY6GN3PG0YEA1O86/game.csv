"Hi Bob, I’m glad to connect with you. I have an exceptional product available, and given its unique value and capabilities, I’m setting the price at $1200000. I believe this product offers unparalleled benefits that justify this investment. Let me know if you’re interested or have any questions.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but I need to be transparent that $1200000 is beyond my budget for this product. I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $1000000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better agreement. My research shows that a fair market value would be around $850000, which is what I'm prepared to offer. This would save me money compared to John's offer while still providing you with a profitable sale. Would this work for you?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your candid response. I appreciate your transparency about budget and the comparison with John. That said, the quality and unique features of my product justify a premium well above the fair market value you mentioned. Considering its exceptional value, I can offer it to you for $1000000. I believe this represents a competitive deal given what similar products are being offered elsewhere. Please let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down to $1000000, Alice. I appreciate that you've matched John's offer. However, since I'm now comparing identical prices, I need to consider other factors to make my decision. If I'm going to choose you as my supplier over John, I'd like to see some additional value - either in the form of a slightly better price or perhaps some added service or warranty. Would you be willing to offer the product at $950000? This would give me a clear reason to move forward with you rather than John. I'm ready to close this deal quickly if we can reach this agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
