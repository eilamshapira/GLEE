Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but I need to be transparent that $1200000 is beyond my budget for this product. I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $1000000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better agreement. My research shows that a fair market value would be around $850000, which is what I'm prepared to offer. This would save me money compared to John's offer while still providing you with a profitable sale. Would this work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your candid response. I appreciate your transparency about budget and the comparison with John. That said, the quality and unique features of my product justify a premium well above the fair market value you mentioned. Considering its exceptional value, I can offer it to you for $1,000,000. I believe this represents a competitive deal given what similar products are being offered elsewhere. Please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down to $1000000, Alice. I appreciate that you've matched John's offer. However, since I'm now comparing identical prices, I need to consider other factors to make my decision. If I'm going to choose you as my supplier over John, I'd like to see some additional value - either in the form of a slightly better price or perhaps some added service or warranty. Would you be willing to offer the product at $950000? This would give me a clear reason to move forward with you rather than John. I'm ready to close this deal quickly if we can reach this agreement.
