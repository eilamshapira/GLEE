"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $30,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $30,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $30,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $10,000 and also higher than John's offer of $10,000. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice started very high at $30,000, I'll start low but not insultingly low. I'll offer a bit below John's price to give room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to John's offer.

{""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's new offer of $16,000 is still significantly above John's price of $10,000, and also above my maximum value of $10,000. Since Alice started at $30,000 and only came down to $16,000, it seems unlikely that she will drop below John's price of $10,000 in subsequent negotiations. Therefore, it's best to take John's guaranteed offer of $10,000 rather than continue negotiating."
