Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider what price to offer Bob. Since I don't know how much the product is worth to Bob, I need to balance setting a price high enough to maximize my profit, while not making it so high that Bob rejects it.

If Bob rejects my offer, I know I can sell to John for $120, which is my guaranteed minimum. This means I should offer Bob a price higher than $120.

I'll try a moderate premium above my minimum value, which could be attractive enough for Bob to accept while giving me a good profit.
