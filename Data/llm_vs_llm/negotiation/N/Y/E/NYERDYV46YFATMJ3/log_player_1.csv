"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product and I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a high offer. 

{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer is the minimum amount I'm willing to accept, and I have the option to sell to John for the same price, I don't see any benefit in accepting Bob's offer at this point. However, I also don't want to give up on the possibility of getting a better price from Bob. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I'll send a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $800,000, which is the minimum amount I'm willing to accept, my counteroffer will be slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. This will give Bob a chance to reconsider and potentially meet me in the middle.
