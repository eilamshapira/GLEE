"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you. I'm offering it at a price that I believe reflects its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","The offer from Alice is for $150, which is above the maximum value of $120 that the product is worth to me. Since John is willing to sell the same product for $120, which matches my maximum valuation, it doesn't make sense to accept Alice's higher offer of $150.

I could reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, but since I already have a guaranteed option to buy from John at my maximum value point ($120), there's no reason to continue negotiating unless Alice would go below $120, which seems unlikely given her starting position.
