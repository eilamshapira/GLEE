Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it to you for $180."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering this product. While I appreciate the quality you described, $180 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I can still negotiate for a better price than John's $150 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for this product. I have another buyer willing to pay $150, but I'd like to work with you. I can offer it to you for $160, which is a better price than my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I need to stay within my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's maximum offer of $130 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and it's clear that Bob's budget constraints won't allow him to meet my minimum price, I'll take John's guaranteed offer of $150."
