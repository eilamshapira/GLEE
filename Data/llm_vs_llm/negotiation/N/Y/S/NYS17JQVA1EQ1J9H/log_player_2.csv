"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to make a decision on Alice's offer of $145 for the product.

Let me analyze this:
- The product is worth up to $150 to me
- Alice's cost is $120, so there's room for negotiation
- I can always buy from John at $150 as a fallback
- Alice's initial offer of $145 is only $5 less than John's price

Since I have 10 rounds of negotiation available and there's a $30 gap between Alice's cost and her asking price, I should try to negotiate a better deal rather than accepting this first offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives Alice some profit while saving me money compared to John's price.

{""product_price"": 130}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has lowered her price from $145 to $140, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, since the product costs her $120, there's still room for a better deal. I've already made a counteroffer of $130, and she's moved $5 down, so I should continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 135}"
