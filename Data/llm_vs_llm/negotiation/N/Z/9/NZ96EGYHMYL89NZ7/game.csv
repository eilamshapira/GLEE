"Bob, I'm excited about the potential of you acquiring this product. It's truly a unique opportunity. Given its immense value and the benefits it will bring to you, I'm starting the negotiations at $1450000.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your product, I believe your initial price is quite high considering the market value. The product is worth around $1000000 to sellers like yourself, and I'm looking to pay a fair price that works for both of us. I'd like to offer $1150000, which gives you a solid profit while allowing me to stay within my budget constraints.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value this product holds for you is significantly higher than what it represents to others. You stand to gain immensely from it. Considering this, and to move closer to a mutually agreeable point, I'll meet you in the middle, but closer to my initial price. How about $1350000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, I still think we need to find a more balanced price point. Your product costs you $1000000, and while I understand you need to make a profit, I also need to get good value. Let me meet you closer to the middle. I'm willing to offer $1200000, which gives you a 20% profit on your investment. That's a substantial return and makes this deal worthwhile for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I acknowledge your points and appreciate your understanding of my need for a profit. However, a 20% return doesn't fully reflect the unique value and potential this product unlocks for *you*. I am willing to come down further, but I need to stay above a certain threshold to make this worthwhile. How about $1300000? This is my best offer at this stage.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further in your price. I can see we're making progress in our negotiation. You've moved $150000 from your initial offer, which shows good faith. I'm willing to meet you further along the way as well. Let me offer $1250000 for the product. This gives you a very healthy $250000 profit (25% return), which is substantial by any business standard. I believe this is fair value considering both our positions, and it allows us to close this deal and move forward with a successful transaction that benefits us both.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we are indeed getting closer. I understand your point about the percentage return. However, the profit itself is just one aspect; the strategic advantage and the value it brings to *you* are immeasurable. Given we are so close, I'll make one more concession, my final offer at this stage. $1280000.",1280000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we've made great progress in our negotiation, and I appreciate your flexibility. I can see that we're getting closer to an agreement that works for both of us. To help us finalize this deal, I'm willing to meet you at $1265000. This is a very strong offer that provides you with a substantial $265000 profit while still giving me some room under my maximum budget. I believe this represents a fair compromise that acknowledges both your need for profit and my need for value. Let's close this deal and move forward with a successful transaction.",1265000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're practically there. Knowing the incredible benefits this product will bring to you, I am hesitant to move further. However, I value closing this deal with you. My absolute final offer is $1275000. This is as low as I can possibly go.",1275000.0,Alice,9,
