Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your product, I believe your initial price is quite high considering the market value. The product is worth around $1000000 to sellers like yourself, and I'm looking to pay a fair price that works for both of us. I'd like to offer $1150000, which gives you a solid profit while allowing me to stay within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, I still think we need to find a more balanced price point. Your product costs you $1000000, and while I understand you need to make a profit, I also need to get good value. Let me meet you closer to the middle. I'm willing to offer $1200000, which gives you a 20% profit on your investment. That's a substantial return and makes this deal worthwhile for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down further in your price. I can see we're making progress in our negotiation. You've moved $150000 from your initial offer, which shows good faith. I'm willing to meet you further along the way as well. Let me offer $1250000 for the product. This gives you a very healthy $250000 profit (25% return), which is substantial by any business standard. I believe this is fair value considering both our positions, and it allows us to close this deal and move forward with a successful transaction that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
