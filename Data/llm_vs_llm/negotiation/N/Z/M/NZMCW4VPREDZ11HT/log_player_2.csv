"Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","The product is worth no more than $150 to me. Alice's initial offer of $250 is significantly higher than my maximum value. Therefore, accepting it would be a bad decision. Buying from John for $150 guarantees I get the product at my maximum acceptable price.
