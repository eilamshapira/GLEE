"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20000. I think it's a great deal for you, given its value and potential.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $10000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $17000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13000, which is closer to my budget and still represents a good value for the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $13000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle at $15000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not comfortable with $15000. Let's split the difference and settle on $14000. This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",14000.0,Bob,6,
