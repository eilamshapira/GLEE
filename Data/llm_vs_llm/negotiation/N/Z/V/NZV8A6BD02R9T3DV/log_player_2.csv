"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20000. I think it's a great deal for you, given its value and potential.  What do you think?

Alice's offer is way too high. I'll try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $10000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm not sure the value of the product to Alice, but I'll try to push for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $17,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is closer to my budget and still represents a good value for the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you.  $13000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle at $15000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still hesitant to go above $13,000.  I'll make one more counteroffer, but I'm getting closer to just buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
