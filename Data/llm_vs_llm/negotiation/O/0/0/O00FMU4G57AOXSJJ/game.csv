"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price. While $150 is my absolute minimum, I'm looking to get more value for this product. I can come down to $175, which is a fair middle ground between our positions. This is a high-quality product that will serve you well. What do you think about that price?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $175 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $160, which is closer to my budget and still a fair price for the product. Let me know what you think.",160.0,Bob,4,
