"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product. I think it's really valuable, and I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, I'm not willing to sell for $90. That's less than what the product is worth to me and less than I can get from John.

So, I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I can't go down to $90, but I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $130, but it's still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I can do $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Hmm, $100 is still not good enough. It's below what the product is worth to me, and well below what John will pay. I also believe that Bob is willing to pay more.

I'll reject Bob's offer again and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I see where you're coming from, but I really can't go that low. How about we split the difference again? I'll offer it to you for $125."", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $125 is close, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, this is a tougher decision. $115 is still less than what John is offering. However, if I reject this offer, there is a chance that Bob will not increase his offer, so I may lose out.
I think I will reject the offer, and offer Bob a price of $120.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, here's my counteroffer:
