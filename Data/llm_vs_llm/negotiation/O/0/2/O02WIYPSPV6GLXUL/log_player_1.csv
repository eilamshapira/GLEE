Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get more than my minimum acceptable price of $100.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer ($80) is below my minimum acceptable price ($100) and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, I'll reject Bob's offer but continue negotiating since there might be potential for a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial $180, but still keep it well above my minimum to maintain room for negotiation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer ($90) is still below my minimum acceptable price ($100) and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, at this point I should take the guaranteed $100 from John. Bob's offers are trending up very slowly and remain below my minimum, so it's safer to take the sure deal.
