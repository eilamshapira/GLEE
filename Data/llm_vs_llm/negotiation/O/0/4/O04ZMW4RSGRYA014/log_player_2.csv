"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given that Alice's offer is $120, which is the same price as John's offer, and it's the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, it makes sense to reject and make a counteroffer. There's potential to get a better deal from Alice, while I still have John's $120 offer as a backup.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial $120 offer, but not so low as to be unreasonable. A reasonable starting point for negotiation would be around 60% of the initial offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has reduced her price from $120 to $100, which is a good improvement and $20 less than John's price. However, since she was willing to drop the price significantly from her first offer, there might still be room for negotiation. I'll reject and try one more counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $120 to $100, and she rejected my previous offer of $75, I'll try to meet closer to the middle between my last offer and her current offer.
