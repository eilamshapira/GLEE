"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'll analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering the product for $20,000
2. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me (Bob)
3. I can buy the same product from John for $8,000
4. My goal is to save as much money as possible

Alice's offer ($20,000) is significantly higher than both the product's value to me ($8,000) and John's offer ($8,000). There's no reason to accept Alice's offer.
