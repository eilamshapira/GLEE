"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Looking at the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $120 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $150
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $120

Since Alice's price ($150) exceeds both the value the product has to me and John's alternative price, the rational decision is to buy from John instead.
