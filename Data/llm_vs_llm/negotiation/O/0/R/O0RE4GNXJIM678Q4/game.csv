"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I appreciate your perspective on the value. However, my initial offer reflects the true worth and potential of this product, particularly in the long run. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2000000. This is a significant reduction and a fair offer considering the immense value this product holds.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2000000 is still quite high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $900000. This price point feels more realistic for my budget and the potential benefits I might see from the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects.  I'm willing to drop to $1700000, but that's my absolute lowest.  This offer takes into account your perspective while still reflecting the true worth of what's on the table.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
