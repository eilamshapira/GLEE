"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

In this case, since all options lead to paying $1,000,000 for the product, it makes no difference financially which option I choose. I'll accept Alice's offer since it's the most straightforward option and maintains a good business relationship with Alice."
