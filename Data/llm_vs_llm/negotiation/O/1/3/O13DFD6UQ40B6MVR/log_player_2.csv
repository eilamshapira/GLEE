"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Based on the information given, Alice's offer is for $10,000, which is the same as the worth of the product to her. However, this exceeds the maximum of $8,000 that the product is worth to you (Bob).

Considering my options:
- Alice's offer ($10,000) exceeds my valuation of the product
- John is willing to sell the same product for $8,000, which matches my maximum valuation

It makes financial sense to buy from John for $8,000 rather than accept Alice's higher offer.
