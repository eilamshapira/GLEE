"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since the product is worth $800,000 to me and Alice's offer of $950,000 exceeds that value, it doesn't make sense to accept the offer as it is higher than what the product is worth to me. Additionally, buying from John for $800,000 is an option that matches the product's worth to me, but I'd like to try and negotiate a better price with Alice first. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of getting a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make an initial counteroffer that is lower than Alice's offer but still reasonable, considering the product's worth to me. Since I know the product is worth $800,000 to me and Alice initially offered $950,000, I'll start by offering a price that is somewhat closer to my maximum budget but leaves room for further negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $875,000 is closer to my budget of $800,000 but still exceeds it. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, accepting this offer would mean spending more than the product is worth to me. However, it's also important to consider that negotiating further might not yield a significantly better offer, and buying from John for $800,000 is still an option that matches my budget exactly.

Given that Alice's offer has moved closer to my target but still hasn't met it, and considering the option to buy from John at $800,000, I will reject Alice's offer again. This decision is made in the hope that further negotiation could bring the price down to or below $800,000, which is the product's worth to me.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $875,000 and I'm trying to get as close as possible to my maximum budget of $800,000 without going over, I'll make a counteroffer that splits the difference between Alice's last offer and my target price. This approach shows that I'm willing to negotiate and meet Alice halfway but also emphasizes my budget constraint.

The difference between Alice's offer ($875,000) and my target ($800,000) is $75,000. Splitting this difference would mean reducing Alice's offer by half of $75,000, which is $37,500. So, my counteroffer would be $875,000 - $37,500 = $837,500.
