"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $2000000. This is a competitive price for such a premium product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $2,000,000, which is significantly above my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $1,500,000

It would not make sense to accept Alice's offer of $2,000,000 as it's well above both my maximum value and John's price. I could try to negotiate with Alice, but since John's price already matches my maximum value, it's most logical to simply buy from John.
