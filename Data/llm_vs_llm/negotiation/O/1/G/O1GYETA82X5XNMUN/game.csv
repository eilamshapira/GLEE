"Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for a great price of $200. It's a steal! What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget, but $80 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $140 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $95? That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious, and I want to make this work.  How about $125? That's a $15 compromise on my end, and it gets us closer to a deal.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $110? That feels like a fair deal to me.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're a tough negotiator! I appreciate your persistence.  Let's try this: $117.50. I'm really trying to make this work.",117.5,Alice,7,
