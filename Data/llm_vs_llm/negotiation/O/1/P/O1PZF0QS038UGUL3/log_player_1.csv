# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget range. I'm interested in the product and would be willing to pay $60 for it. Let me know if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
