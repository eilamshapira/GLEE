"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to consider my options here:

1. Accept Alice's offer of $20,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John for $8,000

Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and John is offering it for exactly $8,000, Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than both the value to me and my alternative option. It would make no financial sense to accept Alice's offer.

The most rational decision is to buy from John for $8,000.
