"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $18500. This is a competitive price for such a premium item.",18500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. That price seems a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, I need to be transparent - I have another buyer willing to pay $10000, so I cannot go below that price. However, I still believe this product would be more valuable to you, and I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price significantly. I can offer it to you for $14000, which is a substantial reduction from my first offer.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I understand it's a good product, but $14000 is still a stretch for my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between your offer and mine, at $11000. That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
