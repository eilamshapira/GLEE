"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $18,500. This is a competitive price for such a premium item."", ""product_price"": 18500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. That price seems a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 (which I can get from John), so I cannot accept it. However, since Bob has shown interest and there's room for negotiation, I'll continue the discussion with a new offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, I need to be transparent - I have another buyer willing to pay $10,000, so I cannot go below that price. However, I still believe this product would be more valuable to you, and I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price significantly. I can offer it to you for $14,000, which is a substantial reduction from my first offer."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I understand it's a good product, but $14000 is still a stretch for my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between your offer and mine, at $11000. That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $11,000. This is a reasonable price that exceeds my minimum threshold of $10,000 (John's offer), and Bob has shown good faith in negotiating by making a significant increase from his initial offer. This represents a fair compromise that benefits both parties."
