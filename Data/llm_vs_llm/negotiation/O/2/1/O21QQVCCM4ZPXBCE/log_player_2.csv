"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $18500. This is a competitive price for such a premium item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. That price seems a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8,000 for it."",
 ""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

This starting counter-offer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer. This accomplishes a few things:

* **Gauges Alice's flexibility:**  It helps us understand how much Alice is willing to negotiate. 
* **Establishes our target range:** It sets a starting point for us to potentially reach a price closer to our $12,000 maximum.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  We've given ourselves space to increase our offer if needed, while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, I need to be transparent - I have another buyer willing to pay $10000, so I cannot go below that price. However, I still believe this product would be more valuable to you, and I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price significantly. I can offer it to you for $14000, which is a substantial reduction from my first offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice mentioning another buyer is likely a negotiation tactic, but it does tell us that she's probably willing to go a bit lower than $14,000. We're still significantly above our ideal price, so we'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I understand it's a good product, but $14,000 is still a stretch for my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between your offer and mine, at $11,000. That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this counteroffer:

* **Show willingness to negotiate:** We're moving closer to her price, demonstrating that we're serious about finding a deal. 
* **Stay within budget:**  $11,000 keeps us under our $12,000 maximum.
* **""Halfway"" framing:** By positioning our offer as a compromise at the midpoint, it feels more reasonable and might make Alice more receptive."
