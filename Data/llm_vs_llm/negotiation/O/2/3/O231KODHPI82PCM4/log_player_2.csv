"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **Alice's Offer:** $14,500
*   **My Valuation:** $15,000 (maximum I'll pay)
*   **John's Offer:** $15,000

Since Alice's offer is less than what the product is worth to me, and it's less than John's offer, I should accept it.
