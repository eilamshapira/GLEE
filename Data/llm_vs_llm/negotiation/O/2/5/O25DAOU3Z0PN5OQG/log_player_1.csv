Round 2

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $120 is higher than my minimum price of $100 and lower than his perceived value of $150, I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll try to meet Bob halfway between my previous offer and his counteroffer. My previous offer was $140, and his counteroffer was $120, so I'll offer $130.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer is $125, and my previous offer was $130, I'll try to find a middle ground. I'll offer $127.50, which is slightly lower than my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's current offer.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $126. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $126
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer of $126 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $127.50. At this point, I think it's a good idea to accept his offer, as it's still a good price and we're running out of rounds. Accepting $126 is better than risking further negotiation and potentially having to sell to John for $100.
