"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm offering it to you for $14000. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go lower to make a sale."
