"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, the price of $20000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only consider it if the price is significantly lower. I'd like to propose a price of $5000.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal. However, $5000 is significantly lower than our valuation. Given this, I'm willing to lower our initial price to $18000.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $18000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer, but I need a more substantial reduction in price. I'd like to propose a price of $7000.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're still quite far apart on the price. To try and bridge this gap, I'm willing to lower the price to $16000. This is very close to the minimum I can accept, so I hope we can make this work.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to lower the price. However, $16000 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. Given that you mentioned $16000 is close to the minimum you can accept, I'm willing to make a more significant concession. I'd like to propose a price of $9000, which is very close to my maximum budget.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. I'm willing to make another concession to try and close this deal. Let's settle for $13000.",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to lower the price. However, $13000 is still above my budget. Given that we're getting closer to a mutually acceptable price, I'd like to propose a price of $9500. If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to consider alternative options that better fit my budget.",9500.0,Bob,8,
