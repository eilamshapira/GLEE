"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $11,000 is high and closer to John's price of $12,000, and knowing the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, I should try to negotiate for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and I value it up to $12,000, I'll start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation. I'll offer a price that's reasonably above Alice's cost but significantly below her initial offer.

{""product_price"": 9000}

This offer gives Alice a $1,000 profit margin above her cost ($8,000) while still being $2,000 less than her initial offer. It also leaves room for negotiation while being well below my maximum price of $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price from $11,000 to $10,500, showing willingness to negotiate. However, there might still be room for a better deal since her cost is $8,000. I'll reject this offer and try one more counter.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still try to get a good deal. Since Alice came down $500 from her initial offer, I'll come up a similar amount from my previous offer to show good faith in the negotiation.

{""product_price"": 9500}

This offer splits the difference between our last positions fairly well. It gives Alice a $1,500 profit margin above her cost ($8,000), which is reasonable, while still saving me a significant amount compared to both Alice's current offer ($10,500) and John's price ($12,000)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has shown continued willingness to negotiate by lowering her price further to $10,250. This is now $1,750 less than John's price ($12,000), and while Alice still has a healthy profit margin of $2,250 above her cost, we've reached a point where the potential benefit of further negotiation might not be worth the risk of losing the deal. The price movements are getting smaller, suggesting we're approaching Alice's bottom line. I'll accept this offer.
