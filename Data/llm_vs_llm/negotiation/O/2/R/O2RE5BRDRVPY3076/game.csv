"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only consider a much lower price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $4000.",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but $4000 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'd like to make a counteroffer that's more reasonable.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer, but I need to stay within a reasonable range. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6000.",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $6000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm trying to be flexible and find a price that works for both of us. Considering your previous offers, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous counteroffer. I'd like to propose a price that's closer to my minimum, but still shows I'm willing to negotiate.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $16000 is still significantly above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer again, but I need to stay within a reasonable range. Considering your flexibility, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7000.",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your latest offer, but $7000 is still not close to what I'm looking for. I'm starting to think that we might not be able to reach a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm willing to give it one more try. I'll make a small concession, but I need you to consider a significantly higher price. If you're truly interested in the product, I'd like to propose a price that's closer to my minimum.",15000.0,Alice,7,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $15000 is still above my budget. I've been considering my options, and I'm willing to make one more offer. I'd like to propose a price that's slightly higher than my previous offer, but still within my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500.",7500.0,Bob,8,
