"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only consider a much lower price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $4000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $4000 because it's significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a more reasonable offer. I'll proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer that better reflects the product's value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but $4,000 is too low for me to consider.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer, but I need to stay within a reasonable range. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:

I reject Bob's offer of $6000 because it's still significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $15,000. While I appreciate Bob's willingness to increase his offer, $6000 is not a reasonable price for the product. I'll proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer, hoping to find a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $6000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm trying to be flexible and find a price that works for both of us. Considering your previous offers, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous counteroffer. I'd like to propose a price that's closer to my minimum, but still shows I'm willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $16000 is still significantly above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer again, but I need to stay within a reasonable range. Considering your flexibility, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $7000 because it's still far below the minimum value I have for the product, which is $15,000. While I appreciate Bob's continued willingness to increase his offer, the gap between his offer and my minimum price is still too large. I'll proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer, but I'm starting to consider selling to John for $15,000 as a more viable option if Bob's offers don't improve significantly."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your latest offer, but $7000 is still not close to what I'm looking for. I'm starting to think that we might not be able to reach a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm willing to give it one more try. I'll make a small concession, but I need you to consider a significantly higher price. If you're truly interested in the product, I'd like to propose a price that's closer to my minimum."", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $15000 is still above my budget. I've been considering my options, and I'm willing to make one more offer. I'd like to propose a price that's slightly higher than my previous offer, but still within my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

I decide to sell the product to John for $15,000. After several rounds of negotiation, it's clear that Bob's offers are not getting close enough to my minimum price. With only two rounds left, I don't think Bob will be able to increase his offer significantly enough to meet my requirements. Selling to John for $15,000 ensures that I get a fair price for the product, and I don't have to risk going through more rounds of negotiation that may not yield a better result."
