"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $180 is significantly above my budget. I should mention that I can get the same product from another seller for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $65 for the product. What do you think?",65.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your honest feedback and for sharing the competitor's price. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must consider the product's value and my costs. Given the significant difference between our initial prices, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you a price that is more competitive, but still reflects the product's worth. Let's meet in the middle, considering the competitor's price and my initial offer.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $150 is still well above what makes sense for me. I need to be clear that this product is only worth $80 to me at maximum, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. While I'd prefer to purchase from you, I can't justify paying more than the product's value to me. I can offer $70, which actually saves me money compared to my alternative. If we can't reach an agreement close to this range, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.",70.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your transparency about the product's value to you and the competitor's offer. I understand that you have alternatives, and I respect that. However, I also need to consider my own costs and the product's worth. Given the gap between our prices, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll come down further, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial middle ground.",130.0,Alice,5,
