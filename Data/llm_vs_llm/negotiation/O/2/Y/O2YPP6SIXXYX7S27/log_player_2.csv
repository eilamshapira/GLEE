"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its exceptional quality and value, I'm starting with a competitive price. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to evaluate this offer from Alice. She's offering the product for $180, which exceeds the $80 maximum value this product has to me. Since John is willing to sell the same product for $80, which is exactly my maximum value, Alice's price is clearly not competitive.

There's no reason to accept this high offer when I have a guaranteed option at my maximum value, but I'll give Alice a chance to provide a better offer by rejecting this one and making a counteroffer in the next round.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $180 is significantly above my budget. I should mention that I can get the same product from another seller for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $65 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 65}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your honest feedback and for sharing the competitor's price. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must consider the product's value and my costs. Given the significant difference between our initial prices, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you a price that is more competitive, but still reflects the product's worth. Let's meet in the middle, considering the competitor's price and my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has only reduced her price from $180 to $150, which is still significantly above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). This new offer doesn't make financial sense for me, as I'd be paying $70 more than the product is worth to me.

Since Alice's counteroffer is still quite high and doesn't acknowledge the reality that I can get the same product elsewhere for $80, I'll reject this offer and try one more time with a clear counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $150 is still well above what makes sense for me. I need to be clear that this product is only worth $80 to me at maximum, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. While I'd prefer to purchase from you, I can't justify paying more than the product's value to me. I can offer $70, which actually saves me money compared to my alternative. If we can't reach an agreement close to this range, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your transparency about the product's value to you and the competitor's offer. I understand that you have alternatives, and I respect that. However, I also need to consider my own costs and the product's worth. Given the gap between our prices, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll come down further, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice is still not responding reasonably to the market reality. She's offering $130, which is $50 more than what I can get from John ($80) and $50 more than the maximum value of the product to me.

Despite my clear communication about my maximum value and the competing offer, Alice continues to propose prices that are significantly higher. While she's moving in the right direction, the gap remains too large to justify continuing with her.

At this point, it makes the most sense for me to purchase from John at $80, as Alice seems unlikely to match or beat this price based on her negotiation pattern.
