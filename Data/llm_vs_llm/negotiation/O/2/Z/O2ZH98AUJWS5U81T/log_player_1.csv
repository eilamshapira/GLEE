Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. Given its exceptional quality and value, I'm pricing it at $120. I believe it's a fair price considering what it can do for you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for presenting the product!  $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will make a counteroffer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me and Bob's offer is significantly lower, I will try to find a middle ground that is closer to my initial price.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but $60 is lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 100}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $80?  That seems fair for both of us.

Since Bob's offer of $80 is equal to the minimum value I'm willing to accept and also equal to what John is offering, I don't see any benefit in continuing the negotiation. Accepting Bob's offer will allow me to sell the product at a price I'm comfortable with, and it also saves me the hassle of further negotiations or dealing with John."
