"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you the product we discussed. I can sell it to you for $14000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $14,000
2. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me (Bob)
3. John is offering the same product for $10,000

Since:
- Alice's price ($14,000) is higher than my maximum value ($10,000)
- John's offer ($10,000) equals my maximum value
- I would lose $4,000 by accepting Alice's offer
- I can get the same product from John at a better price

The logical choice is to buy from John.
