"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to sell you this product for $10000. It's a great piece, and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's offer of $10,000 is above my maximum value of $8,000, and John is offering the same product for $8,000, which is equal to my maximum value, the logical choice is to buy from John.
