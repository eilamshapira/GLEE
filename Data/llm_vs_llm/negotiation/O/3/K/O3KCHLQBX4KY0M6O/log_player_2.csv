"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a great [Product name] that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to reasonable offers.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's starting price is too high. You know you can get the product for $150 from John, so there's no need to accept an offer above that."
