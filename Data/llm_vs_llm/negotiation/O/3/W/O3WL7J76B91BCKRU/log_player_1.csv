Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need a better price. I'll offer you $5000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $5000 because it's significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a more reasonable offer from Bob. I'll proceed to the next round to send a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20,000 might be too high, but $5,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and find a middle ground. I'll lower my price, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for the product."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for lowering your price. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $15000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my previous offer, but I need to stay within my budget. I'll offer you $7000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $7000 because it's still below the minimum value I have for the product, which is $12,000. Although Bob is increasing his offer, the gap between his offer and my minimum acceptable price is still significant. I'll proceed to the next round to send a counteroffer, hoping to find a mutually acceptable price. 

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer. However, $7000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to see a more substantial increase from your side.
