"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential for you, I'm initially pricing it at $2000000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return you'll see on your investment.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to make a counteroffer. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $600000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $600000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1500000. However, I value your interest and want to continue the conversation. How about we meet in the middle a bit? I can offer it to you for $1850000.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1850000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. Considering your minimum acceptable price and my budget constraints, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your minimum price. I'll offer $1050000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm looking forward to your response.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand budget constraints, but $1050000 is still too low for me. I truly can't go below $1500000. However, I am willing to work with you on payment terms to make this deal happen. I can offer you $1650000, with flexible payment options spread over a reasonable timeframe. This allows you to acquire the product while managing your cash flow. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the flexible payment options, but $1650000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. I understand that you can't go below $1500000, but I'm not ready to meet that price yet. I'd like to make another counteroffer. Considering the value of the product to me and the flexible payment terms, I'm willing to offer $1200000. This is the highest I'm willing to go at this point, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
