Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a very high starting point. While I understand this product is unique, $5000000 is far beyond my budget. To start, I'd be willing to offer $1000000 for it.  I'm open to negotiating further, but I need to stay within a reasonable price range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
