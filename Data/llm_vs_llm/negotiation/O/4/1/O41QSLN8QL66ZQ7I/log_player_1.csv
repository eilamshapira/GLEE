Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this:

1. The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob
2. It's worth $1,000,000 to me
3. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $1,000,000
4. Bob will only accept if he feels he's getting value

Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, I should price it below that to give him some incentive to buy, but well above my minimum of $1,000,000 to maximize my profit. I'll aim for a price that gives Bob some surplus value while maximizing my return.
