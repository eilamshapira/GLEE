"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $250 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $40 for it.",40.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $250 might be too high for you, but $40 is too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. How about $200? It's a fair price for the value you're getting.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $200 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I can only go up to $50. I think it's a fair price considering my budget.",50.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're still far apart on the price. I'm willing to come down some more, but I can't go as low as $50. Let's split the difference. How about $150? This is a great value for the product and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $150 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer again, but I can only go up to $60. I think this is a reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product.",60.0,Bob,6,
