"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm starting with a price of $150, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately way below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $120 for you, which is still a great deal! Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $120. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still a bit short of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but $105 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $75, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. If we can't agree on a price, I'll have to consider other options.",75.0,Bob,6,
