"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $18000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counter, Bob. I understand budget considerations. While $25000 is my ideal price, I'm willing to come down a bit to meet you halfway. How about $22000?",22000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down on the price. However, $22000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $18000.  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",18000.0,Bob,4,
