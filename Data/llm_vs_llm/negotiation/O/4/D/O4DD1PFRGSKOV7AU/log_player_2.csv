"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Let's see if Alice can lower her price. The product is worth no more than $150 to me, so I won't accept the current offer of $250. Buying from John for $150 is my last resort.)

Now, let's proceed to the next round, where I will make a counteroffer to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 100}

(I'm starting with a lower offer to see how Alice responds. I want to buy the product but also want to save as much money as possible.)

Now, let's see Alice's response to my counteroffer."
