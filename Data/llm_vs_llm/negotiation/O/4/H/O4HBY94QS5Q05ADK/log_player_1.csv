"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation.  I'll be keeping a close eye on his reaction and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a significant profit. I believe this price is fair and allows for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. While it's closer to my ideal price, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. I'll counter with a price in between our last offers, hoping to reach a deal within the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still holding out for a substantial profit. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to give up on a better deal just yet. I'll counter with a price in between our last offers, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm now offering $1,050,000. This price is a good compromise and shows that I'm serious about reaching a deal with Bob. It's also a price that I'm comfortable with, as it's still above my minimum value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close to a deal, but I'm running out of time. If I keep negotiating, I risk Bob refusing my final offer and potentially selling the product to someone else. John is a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, which is very close to my desired price, so I'm going to take the safe route and sell to him."
