"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exclusive product. Given its rarity and the immense value it holds, I'm initially offering it to you for $2500000. Let me know your thoughts!",2500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2500000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only consider it at a significantly lower price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I also know the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but $600000 is simply not enough. How about we meet in the middle? I'll offer it to you for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $2000000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer, but I need to stay within a reasonable range. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a certain range, but $700000 is just not going to work. I am prepared to lower the price further. How about $1750000? This is a significant discount. I am very willing to sell the product if you accept this price.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $1750000 is still above what I'm willing to pay. I've been considering other options, and I need to stay competitive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but this is a valuable product, and I'm not willing to go much lower. The lowest I can go is $1500000. This is my final offer.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but $1500000 is still too high for me. Considering you said it's your final offer, I'll make one last attempt to meet in the middle. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,8,
