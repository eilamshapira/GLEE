"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exclusive product. Given its rarity and the immense value it holds, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,500,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2500000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only consider it at a significantly lower price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Okay, Bob's counteroffer is much lower than I'd hoped. I need to be strategic here. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate closer to my desired price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, let's try to find some common ground.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I also know the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but $600,000 is simply not enough. How about we meet in the middle? I'll offer it to you for $2,000,000."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $2000000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer, but I need to stay within a reasonable range. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is not going well. Bob's offers are still far too low. However, I have 6 rounds left. I think I can still get a better deal than selling to John. I'll reject Bob's offer and try again.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, let's try a different approach. I need to try to get Bob closer to a more reasonable price.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a certain range, but $700,000 is just not going to work. I am prepared to lower the price further. How about $1,750,000? This is a significant discount. I am very willing to sell the product if you accept this price."", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $1750000 is still above what I'm willing to pay. I've been considering other options, and I need to stay competitive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Okay, Bob's getting closer, but still way too low. I'm starting to get worried. I could take the deal with John, but I still have 4 rounds left, and if Bob is slowly raising his offer, I can probably get a better deal than selling it to John. I'll reject Bob's offer and negotiate again.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, I need to be more assertive now. I'm going to make a slightly more aggressive counteroffer, while also indicating that my price isn't negotiable anymore.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but this is a valuable product, and I'm not willing to go much lower. The lowest I can go is $1,500,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but $1500000 is still too high for me. Considering you said it's your final offer, I'll make one last attempt to meet in the middle. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a difficult decision. Bob is still offering far less than I hoped for. I am beginning to lose faith in my ability to negotiate a better price. I now have only 2 rounds left. Given Bob's pace of offer increases, it is very unlikely that I will get him to raise the offer to more than $1,000,000.
I will sell the product to John.
