"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited you're interested in the product. It's a truly exceptional piece. I'm offering it to you for $17000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and the benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice is offering the product for $17,000, which is actually higher than both my maximum value ($15,000) and John's price ($15,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept her offer. I could try to negotiate with Alice by rejecting and making a counteroffer, but since John is already offering the product at my maximum acceptable price, the most rational decision would be to buy from John directly.
