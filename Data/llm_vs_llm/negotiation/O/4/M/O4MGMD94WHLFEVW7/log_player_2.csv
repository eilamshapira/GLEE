"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you the product for $110. It’s a solid deal considering the quality and value. If you’d like to proceed at this price, great—if not, feel free to suggest a counteroffer. Just a heads-up, I do have another interested buyer at $80, so I’ll need to keep the process moving. Looking forward to your response.
