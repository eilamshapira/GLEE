Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a reasonably high price to leave room for negotiation while still maintaining good profit potential.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","$60 is way too low and is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Since I have John's guaranteed offer of $120, there's no reason to accept such a low offer. However, I'll reject and make a counteroffer rather than immediately selling to John, as there's still potential to get a better price from Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still maintain a price well above my minimum of $120.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer of $70 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and he's only increased his offer by $10 from his previous bid. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, and Bob's negotiating pattern suggests he's unlikely to reach an acceptable price, it's best to end the negotiation and take the guaranteed $120 from John.
