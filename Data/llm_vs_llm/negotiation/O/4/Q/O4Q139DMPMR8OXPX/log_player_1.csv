"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product and I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start by making a high offer. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially settle on a higher price than if I started with a lower offer.

{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is below my minimum threshold of $800,000, and I have the option to sell the product to John for $800,000, I will not accept Bob's offer.

However, I still want to try to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a higher price, so I won't sell to John just yet.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $600,000, which is below my minimum threshold, I'll make a counteroffer that is still high but slightly lower than my initial offer. This will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still expect a good price for the product.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's new offer of $650,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. While it's slightly better than his previous offer, it's not enough to convince me to accept it.

I'll reject Bob's offer again and consider making another counteroffer. However, I'll also keep in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $800,000, which is still a safer choice.

Before making another counteroffer, I'll think about how much more I'm willing to compromise on the price. Since Bob has increased his offer by $50,000, I might consider meeting him halfway between my previous offer and his new offer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's new offer was $650,000, and my previous offer was $1,100,000, I'll try to find a middle ground. I'll reduce my offer by $100,000, which is a significant concession, but still keeps the price above $1,000,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's new offer of $700,000 is getting closer to my minimum threshold of $800,000, but it's still below it. I'm starting to think that Bob might not be willing to meet my minimum price, and I need to consider the option of selling to John for $800,000 more seriously.

However, I'll give Bob one more chance to meet my minimum price. I'll reject his offer again and make another counteroffer, but this time, I'll make it closer to my minimum threshold.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's new offer was $700,000, and I'm getting closer to my minimum threshold of $800,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly above my minimum threshold. This will give Bob a clear idea of my bottom line and encourage him to meet it.
