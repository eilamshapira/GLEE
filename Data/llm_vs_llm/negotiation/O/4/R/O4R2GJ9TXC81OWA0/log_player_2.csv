"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is more than the product's worth to you ($10,000) and more than John's price ($10,000).

Since Alice's offer exceeds both your maximum value for the product and the alternative price from John, it would be economically rational to either make a counteroffer or buy from John directly.

Given that John is offering exactly the maximum price you're willing to pay ($10,000), and there's uncertainty about whether Alice would accept a lower counteroffer, the most prudent decision would be to buy from John.
