"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject Alice's offer of $20,000 as it's significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000 and also higher than John's guaranteed price. It makes sense to try negotiating with Alice for a better price since I have multiple rounds available, but if we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I always have John's $8,000 offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 5000}

I'll make a counteroffer of $5,000. This is significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer and John's price, which gives room for negotiation. Since my maximum value is $8,000 and John's offer is $8,000, I need to try to get a better deal from Alice to make the negotiation worthwhile. Starting with $5,000 allows room for potential back-and-forth negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject Alice's offer of $18,000. While she has reduced her price from $20,000 to $18,000, it's still more than twice my maximum value of $8,000. The reduction is too small to indicate that we're moving toward a reasonable price point. I'll continue negotiating since I still have several rounds left, but if Alice doesn't make more significant reductions in price, I can always fall back on John's $8,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 6000}

I'll increase my previous offer to $6,000. While Alice did come down in price, her offer is still far above my maximum value. By increasing my offer by $1,000, I'm showing willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price well below my maximum of $8,000 and John's alternative offer. This gives room for further negotiation while potentially securing a better deal than John's $8,000 price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject Alice's offer of $16,000. While she continues to lower her price (from $20,000 to $18,000 to $16,000), the reductions are too small and the price is still double my maximum value of $8,000. The pattern suggests Alice might continue to make small concessions, but we're still very far from a price that would be better than John's offer. I'll continue negotiating since I still have rounds left, but if Alice's price reductions continue at this slow pace, I may need to consider taking John's $8,000 offer soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 7000}

I'll increase my offer to $7,000. This is my highest offer yet, showing continued willingness to negotiate and moving closer to my maximum value. However, it still gives me a $1,000 advantage over John's price if Alice accepts. Given that we're more than halfway through our negotiation rounds and Alice's price reductions have been relatively small (about $2,000 per round), I want to make a more substantial move to see if we can reach an agreement. If Alice doesn't respond with a significant price reduction, I may need to take John's offer in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I choose to buy from John for $8,000. At this point, it's clear that Alice and I are too far apart to reach a deal that would be beneficial for me. Alice's latest offer of $15,000 is still nearly double my maximum value, and her price reductions have been minimal (from $20,000 to $15,000 over several rounds, about $1,000-$2,000 per round). At this rate, even with the remaining rounds, it's unlikely we'll reach a price below $8,000. Therefore, it's most rational to take John's guaranteed offer of $8,000 rather than continue negotiating with Alice."
