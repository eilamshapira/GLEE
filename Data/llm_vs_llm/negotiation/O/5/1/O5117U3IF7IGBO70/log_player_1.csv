Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $110 is more than I'm willing to pay. The product is worth about $80 to me, and I can actually get it from another seller for that price. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you be willing to sell it for $70? That would give me a reason to choose you over the other seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but $70 is not a fair price for this product.""} 
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have other options, but I'm confident this product is worth more than $70. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This way, we both get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. That shows you're willing to work with me. However, I really can't go above $80 since that's what I value the product at and what I can get it for elsewhere. To make it worth choosing you over the other seller, would you consider $75? That would give you a quick sale and save me from having to go elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still too low for me. I'm not in a rush to sell, and I believe the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to continue talking, but I need a price closer to my asking price.""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep talking.  Let's meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it shows that I'm willing to make a compromise."", ""product_price"": 85}
