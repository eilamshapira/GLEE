"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to consider the value of the product to me ($80) and the offers available.

Alice's asking for $110, which is above my maximum value. If I buy from her at this price, I'd be paying $30 more than the product is worth to me.

John is offering it for $80, which is exactly my maximum value.

Since Alice's price is significantly higher than my maximum value and John's offer, I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal from her.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $110 is more than I'm willing to pay. The product is worth about $80 to me, and I can actually get it from another seller for that price. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you be willing to sell it for $70? That would give me a reason to choose you over the other seller."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have other options, but I'm confident this product is worth more than $70. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This way, we both get a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has come down to $90, which is better than her initial offer but still $10 more than the product is worth to me and $10 more than John's offer.

Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value ($80), and Alice's new offer is above that, I should reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. That shows you're willing to work with me. However, I really can't go above $80 since that's what I value the product at and what I can get it for elsewhere. To make it worth choosing you over the other seller, would you consider $75? That would give you a quick sale and save me from having to go elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep talking.  Let's meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it shows that I'm willing to make a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice is now offering the product for $85, which is still $5 more than my maximum value and $5 more than John's offer of $80.

Since I can get the product from John at exactly my maximum value ($80), and Alice's offer is still above that, I should buy from John instead.
