Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation,  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still confident in the value of the product. $11,000 is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

```

Bob's offer is my minimum, and I'm not willing to go any lower. John is willing to pay the same amount, so it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid any further negotiations."
