(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $7,500 is lower than my minimum price of $10,000 and also lower than what I know the product is worth to him ($8,000), I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer is: $11,000
