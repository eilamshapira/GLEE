Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make an offer to Bob for the product. I'll think through the situation.

I know:
- Bob values the product at $1,000,000
- I can definitely get $800,000 from John if Bob rejects
- I need to maximize my earnings

If I offer Bob $1,000,000, he would get no surplus value and likely reject.
If I offer Bob a price significantly lower than $1,000,000, I'm leaving money on the table.
I should offer a price that gives Bob some incentive to accept while maximizing my revenue.

A reasonable approach is to give Bob a small discount from his maximum valuation. I'll offer the product at $950,000, which gives Bob a $50,000 surplus while earning me $150,000 more than my fallback option with John.
