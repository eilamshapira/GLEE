Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my exclusive product at a price of $25000. Let me know if you're interested or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer is $25,000, which is way above my budget of $8,000, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower, but still shows that I'm interested in the product.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. However, the price of $25,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for the product. Let me know if we can discuss further."", ""product_price"": 5000}"
