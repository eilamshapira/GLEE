Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your position. I can come down a bit more to meet you halfway. How about $12500? This is the best I can do while still valuing the product appropriately.

Alice has come down significantly in price and is now offering the product for $12,500. Given that the alternative is to buy from John for $15,000, I will accept Alice's offer as it saves me $2,500."
