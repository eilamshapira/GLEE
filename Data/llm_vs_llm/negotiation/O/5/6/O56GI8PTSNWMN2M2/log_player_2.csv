You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, I definitely don't want to pay $150 for it. I also have the option to buy it from John for $80, which is within my budget. However, I'm willing to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's reasonable and within my budget. Since I'm willing to pay no more than $80, I'll start with a lower offer to see how Alice responds.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $140 is still above my budget of $80. While it's a slight decrease from her initial offer of $150, it's not enough to make me want to accept it.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate further. Maybe I can get her to lower the price even more.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice rejected my previous offer of $60, I'll try to meet her halfway between my previous offer and her new offer of $140. However, I'll still keep my counteroffer below my maximum budget of $80.
