"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given that Alice's offer is $1,000,000, which is $200,000 less than what John is offering ($1,200,000), and also below the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000), this is a good offer. However, I might be able to negotiate an even better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to try to get a better price, but not so low that Alice would reject it outright.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her price from $1,000,000 to $950,000, which is $250,000 less than John's price. This is a very good offer and significantly below my maximum price point. While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has already shown willingness to compromise, and this price represents a substantial savings. I'll accept this offer.
