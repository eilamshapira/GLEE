"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and it's also below what John is willing to pay. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a middle ground that's above $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still maintain a price above my minimum threshold and John's offer.

{""product_price"": 12500}

This price represents a significant reduction from my initial offer of $15,000, showing willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a good profit margin. It's also strategically positioned between my initial offer and Bob's $8,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $10,000, and we've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation with Bob's offers remaining below my minimum acceptable price, it's most profitable to take John's certain offer of $10,000 rather than continue negotiations that might not lead to a better outcome."
