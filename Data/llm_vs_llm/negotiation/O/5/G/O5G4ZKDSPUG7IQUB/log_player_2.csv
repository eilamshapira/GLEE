"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer of $12,000 is already below my maximum budget of $15,000, it's a good starting point. However, I'd like to try to negotiate a better price to save as much money as possible.

My decision is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send Alice a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, to see how she responds.

My counteroffer is: {""product_price"": $9,000}

This is a reasonable starting point for the negotiation, and it gives Alice room to consider a lower price while still being within my budget. Let's see how she responds!"
