"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. Iâ€™m offering my exclusive product at $1200000. I believe this price reflects the exceptional value that it offers, and I'm confident you'll see its worth. Please let me know if you accept this offer or if you'd like to discuss any adjustments. I look forward to your reply. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","The offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000 and is also higher than John's price. It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer when I can get the same product from John for $800,000. While I could make a counteroffer, given that Alice's initial offer is so high, it's more efficient to simply go with John's guaranteed price.
