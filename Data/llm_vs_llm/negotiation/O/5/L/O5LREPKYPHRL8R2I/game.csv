"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is much higher than what I am willing to spend. How about I pay $60 for the product? It is still a good deal. Would you be willing to accept this?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is too low for this product given its quality and market value. I understand $150 might have been high for you, so I can offer it for $130, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. Would this work better for you?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for coming down, but $130 is still too high for me. How about I offer $70 for the product?  Would you be willing to accept this?",70.0,Bob,4,
