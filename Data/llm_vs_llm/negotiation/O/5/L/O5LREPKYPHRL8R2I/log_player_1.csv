Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it for $150. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is much higher than what I am willing to spend. How about I pay $60 for the product? It is still a good deal. Would you be willing to accept this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
# Explanation: Bob's offer of $60 is far too low, as it's below both my minimum value ($120) and even below Bob's own value ($80). I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as there might still be room for negotiation between $80 (Bob's value) and $120 (my minimum)."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is too low for this product given its quality and market value. I understand $150 might have been high for you, so I can offer it for $130, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. Would this work better for you?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for coming down, but $130 is still too high for me. How about I offer $70 for the product?  Would you be willing to accept this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
# Explanation: Bob's second offer of $70 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and it's even below his own value of $80. Given that his offers are increasing very slowly ($60 to $70) and remain far below my minimum, it seems unlikely we'll reach a mutually acceptable price. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $120, which meets my minimum price, it's best to take this sure option rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to succeed."
