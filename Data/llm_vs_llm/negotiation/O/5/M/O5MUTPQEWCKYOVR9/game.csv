"Hi Bob! I'm selling this fantastic product. Considering its value, I'm offering it to you for a price of $250. What do you think?",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but $250 is out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate it. However, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $200.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really pushing my budget here, but I could do $140.  Let's see if we can make this work.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm trying to make a fair deal for both of us. Considering the value, and since I know you really want it, I'll come down to $180. This is my final offer.",180.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I hear you, but $180 is still more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $140.  This is my final price.  If you're willing to do that, we have a deal.  If not, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",140.0,Bob,6,
