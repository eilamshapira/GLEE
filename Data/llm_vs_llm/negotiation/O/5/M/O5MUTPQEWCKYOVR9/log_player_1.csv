"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm selling this fantastic product. Considering its value, I'm offering it to you for a price of $250. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but $250 is out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer for Round 3:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really pushing my budget here, but I could do $140.  Let's see if we can make this work.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer for Round 5:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm trying to make a fair deal for both of us. Considering the value, and since I know you really want it, I'll come down to $180. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I hear you, but $180 is still more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $140.  This is my final price.  If you're willing to do that, we have a deal.  If not, I'm going to have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob is threatening to walk away, and he's clearly not budging from $140. I'm also starting to feel like I'm getting nowhere with him. The product is worth $150 to me.

Given the situation, I should take the higher offer.
