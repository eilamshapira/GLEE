"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $200 is way too high considering:
1. The product is only worth $80 to me
2. I have a guaranteed option to buy it from John for $80
3. Alice's cost is $150, so there might be room for negotiation to reach a more reasonable price

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 65}

I'm offering $65, which is below John's price of $80. My reasoning is:
1. This gives room for negotiation upward while still keeping the final price potentially below John's $80
2. While this is below Alice's cost of $150, she doesn't know about John's offer, and this might lead to a counter that's still acceptable to me
3. If Alice rejects this, I can still walk away and buy from John at $80"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll buy from John because:
1. Alice's new offer of $180 is still way above my maximum value of $80
2. While Alice did reduce her price from $200 to $180, she's still far from a price that would be acceptable to me
3. John's guaranteed price of $80 exactly matches my maximum value
4. Further negotiation with Alice seems unlikely to reach a price below $80, since her cost is $150 and she's shown resistance to significant price reductions

It's best to take the sure deal with John rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to succeed."
