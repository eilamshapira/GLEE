Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that the product is worth at least $10,000 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, I should make an offer significantly higher than $10,000 to maximize my potential profit. Since I don't know Bob's maximum valuation, I'll make a reasonably high offer while still keeping it within a realistic range.
