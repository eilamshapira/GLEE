Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. The product looks interesting, but $100 is a bit high for my budget right now. Since we both want to make this work, I'd like to offer $85 for the product. This gives you a small profit and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
