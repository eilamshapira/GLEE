"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you the product for $100. I believe you'll find it a great deal! What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice is offering the product for $100. The product is worth at most $120 to me, and Alice values it at $80.

If I accept Alice's offer, I pay $100 and get $20 in consumer surplus ($120 - $100).

If I buy from John, I pay $120 and get $0 in consumer surplus.

If I reject and make a counteroffer, I have a chance to negotiate a better price with Alice. Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, she should be willing to accept any price above that.

Given these options, I should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. The product looks interesting, but $100 is a bit high for my budget right now. Since we both want to make this work, I'd like to offer $85 for the product. This gives you a small profit and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this updated offer:

Alice has countered with $90, which is a $10 reduction from her initial offer of $100. This is a good improvement. 

If I accept Alice's offer of $90, I pay $90 and get $30 in consumer surplus ($120 - $90).

If I buy from John, I pay $120 and get $0 in consumer surplus.

If I reject and make another counteroffer, I might be able to negotiate an even better price, but there's also a risk that the negotiation could stall or Alice could become less willing to negotiate.

$90 is significantly better than John's price of $120, and it's fairly close to Alice's cost of $80. This represents a reasonable compromise where both Alice and I benefit from the deal.

Given these considerations, I'll accept Alice's offer of $90.
