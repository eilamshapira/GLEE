"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product available today and I’m offering it exclusively to you at $150. Let me know if you’d like to take it off my hands! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $120
2. Alice is offering the product for $150
3. John is offering the product for $120

Since Alice's price ($150) is higher than both:
- My maximum value ($120)
- John's alternative price ($120)

It makes the most sense to buy from John. Accepting Alice's offer would mean paying $30 more than my maximum value, and $30 more than John's price.
