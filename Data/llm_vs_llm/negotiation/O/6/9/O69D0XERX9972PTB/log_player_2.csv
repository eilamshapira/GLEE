"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($12,000) and John's alternative offer ($12,000), it would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. John's offer matches my maximum valuation and is $8,000 cheaper than Alice's offer.
