"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2000000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than both the product's worth to you ($1,200,000) and John's alternative offer ($1,200,000). Accepting Alice's offer would mean paying $800,000 more than the product is worth to you.

Since John is offering the product at exactly what it's worth to you ($1,200,000), and Alice's initial offer is so much higher, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
