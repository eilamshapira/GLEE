"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that my minimum acceptable price is $120 and Bob values the product at $80, I'll start with a higher offer to leave room for negotiation, but not too high to completely discourage Bob.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and even below his own valuation of $80, I will reject this offer. However, given that I have a guaranteed offer from John at $120, which matches my minimum price, and considering that Bob's valuation ($80) is below my minimum acceptable price ($120), there's no realistic possibility of reaching a deal with Bob that would be beneficial for both parties.

Therefore, the most rational decision is to take the guaranteed offer from John.
