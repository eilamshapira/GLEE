Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $12000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the minimum amount I'm willing to accept, and I have the option to sell it to John for the same price, I don't see a benefit in accepting Bob's offer over selling to John. However, I also don't want to give up on the potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $14000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob is getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with, and $14,000 is a significant improvement over his initial offer. Since he's willing to split the difference and meet me halfway, I think it's a good sign that he's serious about buying the product. Accepting his offer would also avoid the risk of him walking away from the deal.
