Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll consider what's a reasonable offer to present to Bob.

Bob values the product at $800,000, and if he rejects my offer, I have a guaranteed fallback buyer (John) at $800,000. Since the product is worth at least $800,000 to me as well, there's no advantage in offering Bob a price below $800,000.

Given these circumstances, I should offer Bob a price slightly above $800,000. This gives me a chance to earn more than my alternative option, while still being close enough to Bob's valuation that he might accept.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'd like to offer you this product for $810,000. This represents excellent value for a product of this quality and specification. I look forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 810000}"
