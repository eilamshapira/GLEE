"Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiating.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Let me know if we can work something out.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $125, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your new offer, so I'll offer $92.50. Let me know if that works for you.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $92.50 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's a good compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'll offer $100, which is a bit higher than my previous offer. If we can meet at $100, I'd be happy to make the purchase.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see you are coming up in your offer, but $100 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and go with $105.  This is a good deal for both of us, I think.",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway at $105. I'm getting close to my budget limit, but I'll try to squeeze out a bit more. I'll offer $102.50, which is a small increase from my previous offer. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to make the purchase.",102.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a price we can both agree on.  I'm willing to come down to $103.75.  That's only a small difference from your offer, and I think it's fair to both of us. What do you say?",103.75,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your latest offer of $103.75. However, I'm still a bit above my desired budget. I'll make a final offer of $80, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying from another seller.",80.0,Bob,10,
