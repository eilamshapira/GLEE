Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a reasonably high offer to leave room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $8,000 as it's well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 (which I can get from John). Since Bob's offer is so low, it suggests we're quite far apart in our valuations. Rather than continue negotiating, it would be more prudent to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John.
