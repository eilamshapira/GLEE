"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. Given its market value and the interest from other potential buyers, I'm offering it to you at a price of $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and worth. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $15,000
3. John is willing to sell it for $12,000

The rational decision is to buy from John. Alice's price is above my maximum valuation, and John's offer matches my maximum valuation. There's no reason to pay $3,000 more for the same product.
