"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You've already stated you are willing to pay $10,000 for the product, and John is offering it at that price.  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer, as you can get the product for the same price from John."
