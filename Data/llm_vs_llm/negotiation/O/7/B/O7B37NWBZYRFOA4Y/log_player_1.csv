Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to counter with $8000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's counteroffer of $8,000 is the minimum value I have for the product, and I also have the option to sell it to John for the same price, I don't see a benefit in accepting Bob's offer over selling to John or trying to negotiate further with Bob. However, selling to John or accepting Bob's offer would end the negotiation immediately without exploring potential for a higher price. Given that Bob has shown interest and is willing to pay $8,000, which is my baseline, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can meet at a higher price.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value lies somewhere in between our initial offers. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price.
