"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's valued at $1500000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1750000.  This price reflects the product's potential and our mutual benefit.  Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1750000 is higher than I'm willing to pay. I value the product, but my budget is a bit tighter. Would you consider $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1300000 is below my minimum value, I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement. I'm offering you the product for $1450000. This price is a fair middle ground that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  Please consider my counteroffer carefully.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
