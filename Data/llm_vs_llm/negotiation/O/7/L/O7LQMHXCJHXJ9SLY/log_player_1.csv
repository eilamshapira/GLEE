"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation, as Bob values the product higher.  Let's see if he's willing to meet me halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting, I'm going to hold out for a better price. I'll send him a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm coming down slightly from my initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum. Hopefully, this shows Bob I'm serious about negotiating but I also won't settle for an unreasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This offer is closer to my ideal price, and it would be a waste of time to continue negotiating. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $1,300,000."
