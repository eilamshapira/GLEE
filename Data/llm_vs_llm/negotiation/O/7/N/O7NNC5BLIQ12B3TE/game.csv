"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for being open to alternative options. I appreciate the reduction in price, but $1800000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $950000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget constraints. If we're still unable to meet at this price, I'd be interested in discussing the alternative options you mentioned to see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer and for being open to discussing alternative options. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm afraid $950000 is still below my expectations. Before we consider other options, I'd like to make one more offer. I'm thinking of a price around $1700000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's exceptional value. If this price is still not feasible for you, I'm more than happy to discuss alternative options that could benefit both parties.",1700000.0,Alice,7,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for being willing to consider alternative options. I appreciate the reduction in price, but $1700000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession and increase my previous offer to $975000, which is the highest I'm comfortable going. If we're still unable to meet at this price, I think it would be best to discuss the alternative options you mentioned to see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution. If not, I'll have to consider other purchasing options.",975000.0,Bob,8,
