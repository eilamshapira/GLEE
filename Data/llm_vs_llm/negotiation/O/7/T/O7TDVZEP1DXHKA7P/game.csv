"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but the lowest I can go is $150 for this product. It's a great deal at this price, considering its value. Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down to $150, Alice. However, that's still a bit high for me. I can stretch my budget to $70. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",70.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I need to maintain a minimum value for this product. I can come down to $130, which is the lowest I can go while still making it worthwhile for me. What do you say?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your latest offer, Alice. I understand you need to maintain value, but $130 is still beyond what I'm comfortable spending. Could you consider $75? That's the highest I can go while still feeling it's a fair deal.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you on the budget concerns. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125? This is really the lowest I can go to ensure I'm not losing out. Let me know if this works for you.",125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $125 is still too high for me. I can go up to $80, which is my absolute limit. If this works for you, let's close the deal.",80.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm trying to work with you. I can lower the price to $122, which is just above my minimum. This is my final offer before I have to consider other options. Let me know if this works for you.",122.0,Alice,9,
