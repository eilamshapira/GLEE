"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique item I believe you'd be incredibly interested in. Considering its rarity and value, I'm offering it to you for a price of: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since the price Alice is offering, $25,000, is more than I'm willing to pay ($12,000), it makes sense to explore other options that could save me money.
