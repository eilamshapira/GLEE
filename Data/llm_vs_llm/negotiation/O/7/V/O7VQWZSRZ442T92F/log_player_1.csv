"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I must say that $3000000 is significantly above my budget and the market value I've researched. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me, which is actually the price another seller (John) has already offered me. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $500000 for the product, which would allow me some value while giving you a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $500,000 because it's significantly lower than the value I have in mind for the product. Since I have the option to sell it to John for $1,500,000, I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price, but it needs to be substantially higher than his current offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $3,000,000 might be out of your budget, but I also have to consider the value of the product to me. Your offer of $500,000 is below my expectations. However, I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Considering your mention of another offer from John at $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a significant concession from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think there might be some confusion. I mentioned that John's offer is $800000, not $1500000. And $800000 is actually the maximum value this product has to me based on my budget constraints and market research. Your offer of $2000000 is still significantly above what I can justify paying. I understand you need to consider your own value, but I need to be practical about mine as well. I can increase my offer to $600000, which I believe is fair considering the market conditions. If we can't find common ground, I'll need to proceed with John's offer, though I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $600,000. Although he has increased his offer, it still falls short of my minimum acceptable price. Given that I have the option to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is more than twice Bob's current offer, I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if he can meet me at a more reasonable price. However, I need to consider making a more significant concession to encourage further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for clarifying John's offer and for increasing your bid to $600,000. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints and market research. However, I still need to consider the value of the product to me. Given that I have an alternative option to sell it for $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another concession to work with you. I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and your current bid."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, I need to be completely transparent with you - the product is worth no more than $800000 to me, which is exactly what John is offering. I literally cannot justify paying more than that based on the value I'll receive. I understand you mentioned having an alternative buyer at $1500000, and if that's a firm offer, you might want to pursue that option. However, if you're interested in closing a deal today, I can offer $700000 - which is my absolute best offer and very close to my maximum value. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll need to go with John's offer instead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $700,000. While he has increased his offer again and claims it's his absolute best, it's still significantly below the alternative offer I have from John for $1,500,000. Bob's transparency about the product's value to him and his budget constraints is appreciated, but given the substantial difference between his offer and my alternative, I'm inclined to hold out for a better deal. Since Bob is close to his maximum value and I'm far from mine, the gap seems too wide to bridge with another counteroffer at this stage, but I'll consider one more attempt to negotiate before opting for the certain sale to John."

Round 7

I understand that $700,000 is your best offer, but it's still below what I'm willing to accept. Given that I have a firm offer of $1,500,000 from another buyer, I need to prioritize that option if we can't get closer to a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try and close the deal with you. I'll lower my price to $1,000,000, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going considering the product's worth to me."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
