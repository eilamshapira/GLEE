"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's initial offer of $3,000,000 is significantly higher than the $800,000 maximum value of the product to me. John's guaranteed price is exactly at my maximum value threshold, which means I would get zero surplus by buying from him. I should try to negotiate with Alice to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I must say that $3,000,000 is significantly above my budget and the market value I've researched. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, which is actually the price another seller (John) has already offered me. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product, which would allow me some value while giving you a fair price."", ""product_price"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $3000000 might be out of your budget, but I also have to consider the value of the product to me. Your offer of $500000 is below my expectations. However, I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Considering your mention of another offer from John at $1500000, I'm willing to make a significant concession from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I notice Alice seems to have misunderstood my previous message. I mentioned John's offer was $800,000, but Alice referenced it as $1,500,000. Her new offer of $2,000,000 is still well above my maximum value of $800,000. Since we're only in round 3 of a possible 10 rounds, I should continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I think there might be some confusion. I mentioned that John's offer is $800,000, not $1,500,000. And $800,000 is actually the maximum value this product has to me based on my budget constraints and market research. Your offer of $2,000,000 is still significantly above what I can justify paying. I understand you need to consider your own value, but I need to be practical about mine as well. I can increase my offer to $600,000, which I believe is fair considering the market conditions. If we can't find common ground, I'll need to proceed with John's offer, though I'd prefer to work with you."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for clarifying John's offer and for increasing your bid to $600000. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints and market research. However, I still need to consider the value of the product to me. Given that I have an alternative option to sell it for $1500000, I'm willing to make another concession to work with you. I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and your current bid. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice mentions she has an alternative option to sell for $1,500,000, which may explain her reluctance to lower the price further. However, her new offer of $1,300,000 is still considerably above my maximum value of $800,000. Since John is willing to sell the product for $800,000, and Alice's offer is $500,000 higher than that, I should continue negotiating or consider buying from John.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, I need to be completely transparent with you - the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, which is exactly what John is offering. I literally cannot justify paying more than that based on the value I'll receive. I understand you mentioned having an alternative buyer at $1,500,000, and if that's a firm offer, you might want to pursue that option. However, if you're interested in closing a deal today, I can offer $700,000 - which is my absolute best offer and very close to my maximum value. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll need to go with John's offer instead."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your transparency about the product's value to you and your budget constraints. I understand that $700000 is your best offer, but it's still below what I'm willing to accept. Given that I have a firm offer of $1500000 from another buyer, I need to prioritize that option if we can't get closer to a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try and close the deal with you. I'll lower my price to $1000000, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going considering the product's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her price to $1,000,000, which is still $200,000 above my maximum value of $800,000. She mentions having a firm offer of $1,500,000 from another buyer, which suggests she likely won't go below $1,000,000. Given that John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value ($800,000), and we're now in round 7 of 10 with Alice still $200,000 above my maximum, it makes financial sense to buy from John.
