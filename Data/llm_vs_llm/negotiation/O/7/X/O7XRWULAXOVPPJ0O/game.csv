"Hi Bob, I see you're interested but still concerned about the price. Let's meet halfway. I can offer the product for $18500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it represents a fair value for both of us. What do you think?",18500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the effort to find a compromise.  While $18500 is closer, it's still a stretch for my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $13500. That's a significant jump on my end.  Let me know if we can make this work.",13500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. I'm willing to come down further to $17000. This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and should be within a reasonable range for the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",17000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me on this. I'm getting close to my limit, but I could stretch to $14000.  This is a really big decision for me, and I want to make sure it's something I can comfortably afford.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,8,
