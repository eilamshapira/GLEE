"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $850,000 is less than my maximum budget of $1,000,000, and it's also less than what I would pay if I were to buy from John, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer to save money.
