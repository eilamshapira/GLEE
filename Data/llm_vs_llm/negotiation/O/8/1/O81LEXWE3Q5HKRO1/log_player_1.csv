Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get more than my minimum acceptable price of $80.

{""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $60 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80, and I already have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $80, there's no reason for me to accept Bob's low offer. I could make a counteroffer, but since Bob's initial offer was so low, and I have a sure deal with John at my minimum price, the most rational decision is to take the guaranteed $80.
