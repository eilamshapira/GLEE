"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 
I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'm confident in the value of my product and want to see if Bob sees that same value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $500,000 is not even close to my minimum.  I will counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm reducing my price a bit, but I'm still confident in the value of my product.  I'm hoping this counteroffer shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, while still aiming for a price that is fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too low.  While I want to close the deal, I can't afford to sell my product for such a low price. I'm going to make another counteroffer, but if it doesn't get us closer to a reasonable price, I may just sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

This is the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm hoping this offer shows Bob my serious intent to reach a deal, while also ensuring I get the minimum value I need for my product. If he rejects this, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum. I've made several compromises and shown flexibility, but it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed sale to John."
