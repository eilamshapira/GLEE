Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value for the product ($800,000) and also higher than John's fixed offer ($800,000), it doesn't make sense to accept this offer. However, I should try negotiating with Alice before going to John, as I might get a better deal.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has lowered her price from $2,000,000 to $1,750,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still significantly above both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's fixed offer ($800,000). I should continue negotiating to see if we can reach a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice continues to reduce her price, now coming down by another $250,000. She seems flexible, so I'll increase my offer further while still keeping well below John's price.
