"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Based on the information provided:

1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $150
3. John is offering the same product for $100

Since Alice's offer ($150) exceeds both the value of the product to me ($100) and John's price ($100), the rational decision would be to buy from John.
