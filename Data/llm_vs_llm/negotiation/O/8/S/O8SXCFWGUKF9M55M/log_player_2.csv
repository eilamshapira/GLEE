"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $200 (which exceeds the $80 maximum value to me)
2. Reject and make a counteroffer
3. Buy from John for $80

The optimal choice is clear. Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, paying $200 would be a significant loss. John's price matches exactly the maximum I'm willing to pay, making it a fair deal.
