"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $15000. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $12,000 to me (maximum value)
2. Alice is offering it for $15,000
3. John is offering it for $12,000

Alice's offer ($15,000) is higher than both:
- The product's value to me ($12,000)
- John's alternative offer ($12,000)

Since Alice's price is higher than my maximum value and I have a better alternative with John, it makes sense to go with John's offer.
