"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to buy this amazing product. I believe it could be a great fit for you! I'm willing to sell it for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. Alice is offering the product for $150
3. John is also selling it for $150

Since all prices are equal ($150), and this is exactly my maximum value, I am indifferent between accepting Alice's offer or buying from John. However, since Alice has already engaged in the negotiation, it would be reasonable to work with her.
