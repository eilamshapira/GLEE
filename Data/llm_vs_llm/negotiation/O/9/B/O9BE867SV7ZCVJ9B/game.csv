"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering its value to me.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns. However, I can't go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $130.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $90, which I think is a more reasonable price for the product.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $90 is still too low for me. I'm really trying to work with you here. My absolute lowest price is $125. That's as low as I can go.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your honesty about your lowest price. However, $125 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle and offer $100, which is the highest I'm willing to pay for the product.",100.0,Bob,6,
