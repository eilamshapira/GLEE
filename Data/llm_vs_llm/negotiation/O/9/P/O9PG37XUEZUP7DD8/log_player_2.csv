"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Okay, I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, reject it and negotiate, or buy from John.

*   **Accepting Alice's offer** means I get the product for $120.
*   **Rejecting Alice's offer** means I can try to negotiate a lower price, but there's a chance she'll stick to $120 or even raise the price later.
*   **Buying from John** means I get the product for $150, the maximum I'm willing to pay.

Since $120 is less than $150 (the price from John), and I want to save money, I should accept Alice's offer.

Therefore, my answer is:
```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```"
