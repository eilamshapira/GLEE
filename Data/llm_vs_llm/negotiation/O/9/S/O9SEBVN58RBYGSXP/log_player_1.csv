"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. Since Bob offered $15,000 (which is my minimum acceptable price), I'll try to negotiate for a better price. Making a higher counteroffer gives me the opportunity to potentially earn more, while I still have John's $15,000 offer as a fallback option.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $17,500. This is a reasonable compromise as it's $2,500 more than my minimum acceptable price (and John's offer). While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might withdraw from the negotiation, leaving me with only John's lower offer. A guaranteed $17,500 is a good outcome."
