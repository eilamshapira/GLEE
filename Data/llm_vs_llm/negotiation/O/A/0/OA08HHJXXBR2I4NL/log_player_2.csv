"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000 for the product. It's also much higher than John's offer of $8,000. Since I can't pay more than the product is worth to me, and John's price matches my maximum valuation, the logical choice is to buy from John.
