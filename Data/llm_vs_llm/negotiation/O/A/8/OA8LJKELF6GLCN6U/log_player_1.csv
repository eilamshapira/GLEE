You have three options:

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept such a low price this early in the game. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob while still securing a decent profit."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum, though it's getting closer.  I want to see if I can push him a little further before considering selling to John. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}

I'm coming down to my minimum price, but I still want to leave some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will finally accept this offer and we can close the deal."
