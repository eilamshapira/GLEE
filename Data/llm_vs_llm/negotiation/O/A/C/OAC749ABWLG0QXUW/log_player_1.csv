Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price seems a little high to me. I'd be willing to pay $800000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and even lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a better price. My next offer will be lower than my initial price but still higher than John's offer, in an attempt to maximize my earnings.

Here's my counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"

Since Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer. However, considering that Bob is willing to increase his offer and we are getting closer to a deal, I will make one more counteroffer to try and negotiate a better price. If Bob rejects my next offer, I will likely sell the product to John.

Here's my counteroffer:

Since Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still lower than what John is willing to pay, and Bob has stated that $1,150,000 is his absolute limit, I will sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This is the best option available to me, as it maximizes my earnings and brings the negotiation to a close."
