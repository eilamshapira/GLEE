"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $150 is significantly higher than my maximum value ($100) and higher than John's price ($100). It's better to reject and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations don't progress well, I can always buy from John at $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 80}

I'll offer $80, which is below Alice's cost ($100) but gives room for negotiation. Since I know John is willing to sell at $100, I want to try to get a better deal from Alice. If Alice rejects this and counters with a price that's still above $100, I can always go to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $120 is still above both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). It's better to reject and continue negotiating. Alice has shown willingness to reduce the price (from $150 to $120), so there might be room for further negotiation. If we can't reach a deal below $100, I can still buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 90}

I'll increase my offer to $90, which is a reasonable step up from my previous offer of $80. This offer is below both my maximum value and John's price, but might be more appealing to Alice as it's closer to her cost. It shows I'm willing to negotiate upward, while still maintaining room for a good deal. If Alice rejects this, I still have the option to go to John at $100."
