Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I certainly can't go as low as $60, but I'm willing to negotiate.

New offer: {""product_price"": 100}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 100}

This is still a fair price for the product. However, if we can reach a better deal for you, I'm willing to work with it."
