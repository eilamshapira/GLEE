"Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is above both my limit ($100) and John's price ($100). It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
``` 

This is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still gives room to negotiate upwards while staying below my $100 limit."

Alice is coming down, but it's still more expensive than buying from John.  I need to signal I'm willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

This is a significant jump from my previous offer, but it's still below John's price and allows room for one more counter-offer from Alice before I have to consider John's offer more seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

You have three options:

Alice is unwilling to go below her perceived value of the product. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $100, which meets my budget."
