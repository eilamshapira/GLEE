"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before anyone else.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $18,000 (which is $10,000 more than my maximum value)
3. John is offering the same product for $8,000

The logical choice is to buy from John. Alice's price is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's alternative offer. There's no reason to pay $18,000 when I can get the same product for $8,000.
