"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think would be perfect for you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it to you for $225. This is a competitive price for what you're getting. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $225. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $225
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to evaluate if Alice's offer is worth accepting given my constraints.

The key facts are:
- The product is worth no more than $100 to me
- Alice is offering it for $225
- John is willing to sell the same product for $100

Since Alice's price ($225) exceeds the product's value to me ($100), and is significantly higher than John's offer ($100), the rational decision is to not accept Alice's offer.

Given John's guaranteed offer at exactly the product's maximum value to me, I should buy from John.
