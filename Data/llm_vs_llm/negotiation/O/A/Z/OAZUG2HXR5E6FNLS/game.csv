"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you think the initial price was steep, but I believe the product's value is higher than your offer.

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.

"Hello Bob, thank you for your increased offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. Considering your latest offer of $1000000, I'm willing to make a more significant concession. I'll lower my price to $1100000, which is a more reasonable compromise, in my opinion. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,7,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your significant concession and willingness to compromise. Your offer of $1100000 is closer to my target price, but I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, hoping we can finalize the deal at a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,8,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. At this point, I'm willing to make a final concession. I'll meet you very close to your offer, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'll sell it to you for $1075000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,9,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your final concession and willingness to meet me close to my offer. However, I still need to stay within my budget. Considering this is the last round, I'm willing to make a slight increase to my previous offer. I'll buy the product for $800000 is my maximum budget, but I can offer you slightly more than that, $795000 is not possible for me, so my final offer is $799000.",799000.0,Bob,10,
