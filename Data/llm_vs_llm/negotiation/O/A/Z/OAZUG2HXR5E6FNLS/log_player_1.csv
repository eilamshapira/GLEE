Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target price. Bob's offer of $700,000 is still too low, and I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."

Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to a reasonable price, but it's still below my target. Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, I'll continue to negotiate with Bob to see if I can get a better offer. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my previous counteroffer, and I appreciate his efforts to meet me in the middle. However, I still think I can get a better deal, and selling to John for $1,500,000 is a more attractive option.

Bob's final offer of $799,000 is still significantly lower than my target price and even lower than my minimum acceptable price.
