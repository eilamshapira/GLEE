"Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll find our asking price of $1400000 quite reasonable.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1400000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000. This represents a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while still leaving you with a substantial profit.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $1100000 is still too low for us. Let's meet in the middle at $1250000. This way, we both make some concessions, and it ensures a fair deal for both parties.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1250000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1150000, which is a significant compromise on my part. I'm confident this price is fair, reflecting the product's value and allowing us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're making an effort to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, your current offer is still not quite where we need it to be. Let's settle for $1200000. This price recognizes both our positions and enables us to reach an agreement that benefits everyone involved.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1175000. I'm confident this price is fair and allows us both to reach an agreement that benefits everyone involved.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
