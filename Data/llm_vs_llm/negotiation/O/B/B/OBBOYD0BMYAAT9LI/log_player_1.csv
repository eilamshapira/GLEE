"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $150. This is a fair price considering its features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I value the product at $100. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $100 is below even my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I want to try negotiating with Bob before settling for John's $120 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. The product's quality and market value make it worth significantly more. I can come down to $135, which is already a considerable discount from my initial price. This is a fair price that reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 135}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the discount. I appreciate your flexibility. However, my budget is quite tight. I can offer you $110 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $120. Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and since we're already in round 4 with Bob still quite far from my minimum price, it's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John rather than risk more rounds of negotiation that might not reach my minimum price."
