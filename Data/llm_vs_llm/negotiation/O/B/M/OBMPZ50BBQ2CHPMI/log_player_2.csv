"Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to analyze this situation carefully. The product is worth at most $150 to me, and Alice is offering it for $145, which is below my maximum value. However, I can potentially negotiate a better price with Alice since the product is only worth $120 to her.

If I reject her offer, I can make a counteroffer that's lower than $145. This gives me an opportunity to save more money. If negotiations fail, I still have the option to buy from John at $150.

Given that Alice has room to lower her price and still make a profit (anything above $120), and I have the safety net of John's offer, I should reject this initial offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives both Alice and me some benefit.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has come down from $145 to $140, which shows she's willing to negotiate. She still has room to go lower since the product is worth $120 to her. I can continue negotiating to try getting a better price while still having John's offer as a backup.

Since Alice moved $5 in my direction, I should continue the negotiation process. $140 is already better than John's price of $150, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved $5 in my direction (from $145 to $140), I'll also adjust my counteroffer upward to show good faith in the negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has now moved from $140 to $138, continuing to negotiate but with smaller increments. We're getting closer to an agreement. The price of $138 is already $12 below John's offer of $150, which is substantial savings.

I could continue negotiating, but Alice's smaller price reduction suggests we're approaching her limit. Given that we're already well below my maximum value of $150 and significantly better than John's offer, accepting this offer would be reasonable.
