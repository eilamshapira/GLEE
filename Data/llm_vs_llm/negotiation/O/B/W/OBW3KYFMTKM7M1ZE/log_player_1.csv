"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at $12,000, which I think is a fair price considering its quality and market value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but considering other options available to me, I am prepared to offer $8000 for the product. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer because selling to either Bob or John at $8,000 yields the same result, and there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is too low for this product's value. I can come down from my initial price to $10,500. This is a competitive price given the product's quality and features. Would you consider this offer?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
