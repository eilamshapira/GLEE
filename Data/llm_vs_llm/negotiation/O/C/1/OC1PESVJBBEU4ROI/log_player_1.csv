Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, I will not accept it. Additionally, selling to John for $8,000 is an option, but I believe I can get a better price from Bob. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

My counteroffer is: $9,500

However, according to the format, I should respond with one of the given options. Since I'm rejecting Bob's offer and planning to make a counteroffer, the correct response is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 9250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly the same as the price I can get from John, and it's also my minimum acceptable price, I don't see any benefit in continuing the negotiation. In this case, accepting Bob's offer or selling to John would result in the same price.
