"Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I have to be transparent with you. Your asking price of $2500000 is well above what I can justify for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $1000000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a more reasonable price. Would you consider $800000 for the product? This would be a win-win situation, allowing me to choose you over the other seller while still meeting my budget constraints.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thank you for your transparency. I understand you have other options. However, my minimum acceptable price is higher than $800000 due to the product's unique features and the significant value it brings. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. How about $2200000?",2200000.0,Alice,3,
