Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I have to be transparent with you. Your asking price of $2500000 is well above what I can justify for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $1000000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a more reasonable price. Would you consider $800000 for the product? This would be a win-win situation, allowing me to choose you over the other seller while still meeting my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
