"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited about the possibility of you acquiring this exceptional product. Given its unique capabilities and potential to revolutionize your operations, I'm offering it to you for $2500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $2,500,000 because:
1. It's significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,000,000
2. I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $1,000,000
3. I can make a counteroffer to Alice to try to get a better price, knowing I always have John's offer as a backup"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I have to be transparent with you. Your asking price of $2,500,000 is well above what I can justify for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $1,000,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a more reasonable price. Would you consider $800,000 for the product? This would be a win-win situation, allowing me to choose you over the other seller while still meeting my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your transparency. I understand you have other options. However, my minimum acceptable price is higher than $800000 due to the product's unique features and the significant value it brings. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. How about $2200000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John because:
1. Alice's new offer of $2,200,000 is still more than twice my maximum value ($1,000,000)
2. Alice indicated her minimum acceptable price is well above $800,000
3. The gap between our positions is too large to bridge through further negotiation
4. John's offer of $1,000,000 is at my maximum acceptable price and represents a guaranteed option"
