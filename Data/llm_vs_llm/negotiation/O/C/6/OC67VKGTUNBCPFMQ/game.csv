"Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $10000. This is a great opportunity to get a top-quality item at a competitive rate. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $10000 is quite high for this product. Given current market conditions and similar products available, I'd be willing to pay $7200 for it. This would still give you a good return while being a fair price for me. What do you think?",7200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. However, considering the value and quality of the product, I'm willing to lower my offer to $9000. This is still a significant discount from my initial price and reflects a fair compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $9000 is still more than what I can get elsewhere in the market. I can offer $7600 for the product. This is a fair increase from my previous offer and would be beneficial for both of us. What are your thoughts?",7600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see your point and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $8500? This price reflects a significant reduction from my original offer while still acknowledging the product's worth. Let me know if this works for you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
