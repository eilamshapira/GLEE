"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $750000. I believe this price is more reasonable, and I'm willing to negotiate further.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget concerns, $750000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This offer is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1200000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this price is more reasonable, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
