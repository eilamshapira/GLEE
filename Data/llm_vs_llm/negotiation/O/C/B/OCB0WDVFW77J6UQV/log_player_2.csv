Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. Considering my budget constraint of $1,000,000, I'll start by offering a significantly lower price to gauge Alice's flexibility.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this price is more reasonable, and I'm willing to negotiate further."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget concerns, $750000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This offer is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,200,000 is still above my budget of $1,000,000. While I appreciate her willingness to compromise, I'm not ready to accept this price.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer, trying to bring the price closer to my budget.

Next, I'll send a new counteroffer to Alice. 

{""message"": ""Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000.
