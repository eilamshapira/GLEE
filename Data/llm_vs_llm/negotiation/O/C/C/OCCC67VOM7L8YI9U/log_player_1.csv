Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to think about what price to offer to Bob.

Bob values the product at $8,000, which means he won't pay more than that amount.
The product is worth no less than $12,000 to me, and I can sell it to John for exactly $12,000 if Bob rejects my offer.

Since Bob won't pay more than $8,000 (his valuation), and I won't accept less than $12,000 (my minimum valuation), there's no price that would work for both of us. Any price acceptable to Bob would be less than my minimum acceptable price.

The rational choice is to offer a price that Bob will reject, so I can sell to John for $12,000. I'll offer Bob a price that exceeds his valuation.
