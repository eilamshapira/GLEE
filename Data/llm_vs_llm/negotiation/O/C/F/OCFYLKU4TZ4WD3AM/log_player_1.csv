"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is better than John's offer, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $11,750?  I'm confident this price still represents a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 11750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about $11000? That's a significant step from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my asking price,  $11,000 is a good compromise, and it's still significantly higher than John's offer."
