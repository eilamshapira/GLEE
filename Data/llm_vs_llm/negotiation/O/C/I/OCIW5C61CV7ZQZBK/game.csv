"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable for you. After careful consideration of its market value and potential benefits, I am offering it to you for $1300000.

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I believe $1300000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product, considering its potential value to me and the market conditions. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $900000. While I appreciate your interest, that figure is closer to my absolute minimum than to the product's true market value. Given that this product would be worth significantly more to you, I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and reflects my genuine interest in working with you rather than other potential buyers.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1150000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and the need to stay within my financial limits. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer to $950000. We're moving in the right direction, but we're still quite far apart. I understand budget constraints, but I also need to consider the product's true value. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1050000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This product is worth $1500000 to you based on my market research, so even at this price, you stand to gain considerable value. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $1050000. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This is the highest I can offer while still making the investment worthwhile for me. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
