Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable for you.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I believe $1300000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product, considering its potential value to me and the market conditions. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $900,000. While I appreciate your interest, that figure is closer to my absolute minimum than to the product's true market value. Given that this product would be worth significantly more to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and reflects my genuine interest in working with you rather than other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1150000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and the need to stay within my financial limits. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer to $950,000. We're moving in the right direction, but we're still quite far apart. I understand budget constraints, but I also need to consider the product's true value. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,050,000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This product is worth $1,500,000 to you based on my market research, so even at this price, you stand to gain considerable value. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
