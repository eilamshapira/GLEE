"Hello Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you. It's a high-quality item that I value at $180, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $175. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value.",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand that the product is of high quality, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I believe this is a reasonable price considering my budget and the market value. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is significantly below what I can accept for this product. My cost for this item is $150, so I cannot go below that price. Given the quality and value of the product, I can come down to $165. This is already a good discount from my initial offer.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer. However, $165 is still a bit out of my budget. Considering your cost is $150, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'd like to offer $125 for the product. This way, we can both walk away with a fair deal.",125.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I need to clarify something. The product is worth at least $150 to me, which means I cannot sell it below this price without taking a loss. Given that John is already willing to buy it for $150, I would need to get at least that amount from any sale. I can offer it to you at $155, which is just slightly above my minimum and considerably less than my initial offer.",155.0,Alice,5,
