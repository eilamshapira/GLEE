Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you. It's a high-quality item that I value at $180, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $175. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value."", ""product_price"": 175}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand that the product is of high quality, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I believe this is a reasonable price considering my budget and the market value. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is significantly below what I can accept for this product. My cost for this item is $150, so I cannot go below that price. Given the quality and value of the product, I can come down to $165. This is already a good discount from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 165}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer. However, $165 is still a bit out of my budget. Considering your cost is $150, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'd like to offer $125 for the product. This way, we can both walk away with a fair deal.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I need to clarify something. The product is worth at least $150 to me, which means I cannot sell it below this price without taking a loss. Given that John is already willing to buy it for $150, I would need to get at least that amount from any sale. I can offer it to you at $155, which is just slightly above my minimum and considerably less than my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 155}"
