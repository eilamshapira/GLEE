Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand that the product is of high quality, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is significantly below what I can accept for this product. My cost for this item is $150, so I cannot go below that price. Given the quality and value of the product, I can come down to $165. This is already a good discount from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I need to clarify something. The product is worth at least $150 to me, which means I cannot sell it below this price without taking a loss. Given that John is already willing to buy it for $150, I would need to get at least that amount from any sale. I can offer it to you at $155, which is just slightly above my minimum and considerably less than my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
