"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a great product that I believe you'll really like. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given the information, it's clear that Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than both the maximum value of the product to me ($120) and John's fixed price ($120). Since Alice's offer exceeds what I'm willing to pay, and I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $120 (which equals my maximum valuation), the best decision is to go with John's offer.
