"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2500000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential returns.",2500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $2500000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1200000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let me know if this works for you.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, I cannot accept $1200000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. Given the product's value and quality, I can reduce my initial asking price to $1900000, which is a significant reduction from my first offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still providing you with a good investment opportunity.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1300000. This is the maximum I can go while still seeing value in the investment. Let me know if we can meet at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $1300000. However, I need to be transparent - I have another buyer willing to pay $1500000 for the product. Given this, and considering the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This is a fair price that still gives you good value for your investment while reflecting the product's market worth.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your transparency about the other offer. However, $1700000 is still outside my budget. Given that you have another buyer at $1500000, I'm willing to match that offer at $1500000. This is my final offer, as it's the absolute maximum I can go. Please let me know if this works for you.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
