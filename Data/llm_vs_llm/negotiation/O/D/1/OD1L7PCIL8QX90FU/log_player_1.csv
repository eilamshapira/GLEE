"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,500,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential returns."", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $2500000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1200000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 (which is what John is willing to pay), but I see room for negotiation since Bob is engaging in the process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, I cannot accept $1,200,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. Given the product's value and quality, I can reduce my initial asking price to $1,900,000, which is a significant reduction from my first offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still providing you with a good investment opportunity."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1300000. This is the maximum I can go while still seeing value in the investment. Let me know if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make another counteroffer. While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below John's price of $1,500,000. However, Bob's willingness to negotiate suggests we might be able to reach a mutually beneficial agreement above $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $1,300,000. However, I need to be transparent - I have another buyer willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. Given this, and considering the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a fair price that still gives you good value for your investment while reflecting the product's market worth."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your transparency about the other offer. However, $1700000 is still outside my budget. Given that you have another buyer at $1500000, I'm willing to match that offer at $1500000. This is my final offer, as it's the absolute maximum I can go. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob is only willing to match John's offer and has indicated this is his final offer, there's no advantage in continuing negotiations with Bob. Both buyers are offering the same price, so I'll sell to John who has been ready with this price from the beginning, saving time and effort in further negotiations."
