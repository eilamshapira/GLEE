"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is significantly above my budget. Given that I can get a similar product elsewhere for $12000, I would need a much better price. I'm willing to offer $10500 for the product. This would still give you a reasonable profit while being more aligned with market prices.",10500.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your position, $10500 is below what I can accept for this product. I'm willing to come down to $14000, which is still a great deal considering the value and uniqueness of what you're getting. Let me know if this works for you.",14000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. Given the value of the product to you, I'm willing to lower the price further to $13000. This should be a fair compromise, considering the quality and exclusivity of the product. What are your thoughts?",13000.0,Alice,3,
