"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $15,000. This is a unique opportunity to own something that will add significant value to your collection. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is significantly above my budget. Given that I can get a similar product elsewhere for $12000, I would need a much better price. I'm willing to offer $10500 for the product. This would still give you a reasonable profit while being more aligned with market prices. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your position, $10,500 is below what I can accept for this product.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here.
