"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit higher than I was expecting. I'm looking to spend no more than $8000 for the product. How about we discuss this further?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that my initial price might have been a bit steep, but I still believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. Considering your interest, I'm willing to make a compromise. However, $8000 is still below what I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle and discuss further.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you, Bob, for increasing your offer to $9000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. We're getting closer, but I still need to consider the product's value and my initial investment. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need you to meet me a bit higher. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial price.",10000.0,Alice,5,
