"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its worth."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit higher than I was expecting. I'm looking to spend no more than $8000 for the product. How about we discuss this further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($10,000) and also lower than what I was hoping to get, I will reject his offer. I still believe I can get a better price from him or from another buyer if the negotiation doesn't go in my favor. Therefore, I will proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that my initial price might have been a bit steep, but I still believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. Considering your interest, I'm willing to make a compromise. However, $8,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle and discuss further."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to increase my offer to $9000. What do you think about that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it's still a bit short. Since we are only in Round 4 and I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, I believe I can try to get a better offer from Bob. Selling to John for $10,000 is still an option, but I'd like to see if Bob is willing to meet me at my desired price or at least get closer to it.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you, Bob, for increasing your offer to $9,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. We're getting closer, but I still need to consider the product's value and my initial investment. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need you to meet me a bit higher. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
