Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine an appropriate price to offer to Bob. 

I know the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and I'm guaranteed to get that amount from John if Bob rejects my offer. Bob's maximum willingness to pay is unknown to me.

If I set the price too high, Bob might reject it, and I'll get $15,000 from John. If I set the price too low, Bob might accept it, but I'll earn less than I potentially could have.

Since I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, I should offer Bob a price higher than that to potentially increase my earnings. I'll set a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value but still potentially attractive to a buyer.
