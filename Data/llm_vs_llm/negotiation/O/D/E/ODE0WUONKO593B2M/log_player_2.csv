"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","**{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**

Let's see if Alice is willing to go lower. There's no harm in trying to save some money since John is offering the same price anyway.

**Counteroffer**: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was hoping to spend around $80. Would you be willing to match that price?"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","**{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was hoping to spend around $80. Would you be willing to match that price?"", ""product_price"": 80}**

Let's wait for Alice's response."
