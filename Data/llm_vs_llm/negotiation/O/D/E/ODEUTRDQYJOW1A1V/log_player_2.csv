It's not worth it to buy the product from Alice for $1,500,000. You can get it from John for $1,000,000, or potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $750,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price and a starting point for negotiation."
