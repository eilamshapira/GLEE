"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $1200000 is higher than what I was expecting to pay. Given current market conditions, I'd be comfortable purchasing it for $900000. This offers you a significant profit margin while allowing me some room in my budget for implementation costs. Let me know if this works for you.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, I have to set a price that reflects the value of the product. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? I think it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",1050000.0,Alice,3,
