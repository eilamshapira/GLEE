"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $1200000 is higher than what I was expecting to pay. Given current market conditions, I'd be comfortable purchasing it for $900000. This offers you a significant profit margin while allowing me some room in my budget for implementation costs. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
