"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $1200000. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $1,200,000, I need to consider my options carefully.

The product is worth up to $1,500,000 to me, so Alice's offer is below my maximum value. I could accept it now, but there's room for negotiation since the product is only worth $800,000 to Alice.

Buying from John at $1,500,000 would be my worst option, as it's more expensive than Alice's current offer.

The best course of action is to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $1,200,000 is higher than what I was expecting to pay. Given current market conditions, I'd be comfortable purchasing it for $900,000. This offers you a significant profit margin while allowing me some room in my budget for implementation costs. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, I have to set a price that reflects the value of the product. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? I think it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has countered with $1,050,000, which is a significant reduction from her initial offer of $1,200,000. This is moving in the right direction.

Analyzing my options:
- The product is worth up to $1,500,000 to me
- Alice's cost is $800,000
- Her current offer of $1,050,000 gives her a $250,000 profit
- John's offer remains at $1,500,000 (which is still my worst option)

Alice has already moved down $150,000 from her initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate. The current price of $1,050,000 is reasonable and represents a $450,000 discount from my maximum value ($1,500,000).

While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of prolonging the negotiation without significant additional savings. The current offer leaves me with substantial surplus value.
