Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it for $20000. This is a premium product with excellent features and quality. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?,20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $5000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5000 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand budget constraints, I need to ensure a fair price for this premium product. I can reduce my initial asking price to $16000, which is a substantial discount. This price better reflects the product's true value and quality. Would you consider this offer?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $16000 is still too high for me. I understand the value of the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we settle at $7000? This is a fair compromise given the constraints I'm working with.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand you're working within budget constraints, but I need to be transparent - I cannot go below $14000 for this product. This is already a significant reduction from my initial price, and reflects the minimum I can accept while still accounting for the product's true value and quality. I've come down $6000 from my initial offer - would you be able to meet me at $14000?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8000. This is my final offer within my budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",8000.0,Bob,6,
