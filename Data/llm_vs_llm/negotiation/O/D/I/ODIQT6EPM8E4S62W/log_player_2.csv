Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5000 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand budget constraints, I need to ensure a fair price for this premium product. I can reduce my initial asking price to $16000, which is a substantial discount.
