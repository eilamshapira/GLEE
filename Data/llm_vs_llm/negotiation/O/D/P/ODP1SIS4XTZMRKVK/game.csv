"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $130. It's a great price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $130 is still a bit high for me. Could you go down to $110? I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I can see we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I still think the product is worth more than $110. How about we meet at $120? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",120.0,Alice,5,
