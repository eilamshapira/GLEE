"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that my initial price might have been a bit steep, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price.

This price reflects the product's worth and is more in line with its true value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

This price represents a compromise between your offer and my previous counteroffer, aiming to find a middle ground that reflects the product's value and meets your budget constraints.
