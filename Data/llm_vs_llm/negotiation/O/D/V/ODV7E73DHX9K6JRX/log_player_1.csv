Bob's offer:

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us while still aiming to get as close to my target price as possible. 

My counteroffer: $1,400,000. This price is still below my minimum threshold but higher than Bob's offer, giving him an incentive to reconsider while also leaving room for further negotiation if needed."

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since Bob has increased his offer to $1,150,000, which is still below my target but getting closer, I'll try to meet him halfway between his latest offer and my previous counteroffer.

My counteroffer: $1,275,000. This price is a compromise, aiming to find a middle ground that works for both of us while ensuring I get a fair value for the product."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your latest offer. I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $1275000 is still a bit high for me.

Since Bob's final offer of $1,200,000 is still below the price I can get from John ($1,500,000), and I've already negotiated down to a point where further concessions might not be beneficial, I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.
