"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of $13,000, reject it, or buy from John for $8,000.

Given that:
- The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
- John is willing to sell the product for $8,000
- Alice is offering the same product for $13,000

Alice's offer is $5,000 more than John's price, and also $5,000 more than the maximum value of the product to me. It would be financially unwise to accept Alice's offer.
