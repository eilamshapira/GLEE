"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for the product:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product. Based on its value and the market, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $800000 is more in line with what I'm looking to spend. How about we discuss this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Given Bob's offer of $800,000, and knowing that John will buy it for the same price, I need to decide if there's potential to get more from Bob. Since I have several rounds left, I'll try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, I believe the product is worth significantly more. Given its unique qualities, I'm willing to come down from my original offer, but I can't go as low as $800,000. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I believe $850000 is a fair price for the product. Let's consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","I have to weigh my options carefully. Bob is now offering $850,000. This is more than I'd get from John. I still have several rounds left, so I could potentially get a higher price from Bob. However, there's also the risk that Bob will lower his offer in the next round or decide to walk away altogether. I'm also starting to get closer to my desired threshold.

Since the risk is relatively low at this point, I will try to close the deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, I'll make one final counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your patience. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. I'll offer the product to you for $875,000. This is my final offer. I need to consider other opportunities as well."", ""product_price"": 875000}"
