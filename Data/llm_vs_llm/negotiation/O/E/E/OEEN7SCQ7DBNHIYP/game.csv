"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $8500. This is still a great price for the quality and value of this product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $8500 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. How about $7500? I'm ready to purchase if that works for you.",7500.0,Bob,4,
