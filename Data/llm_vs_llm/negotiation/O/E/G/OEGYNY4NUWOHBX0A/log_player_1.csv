Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time. This represents a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
