"Alice's offer: The product price will be $199. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $199
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and John is offering it for exactly $100, Alice's offer of $199 is significantly higher than both my valuation and John's price.
