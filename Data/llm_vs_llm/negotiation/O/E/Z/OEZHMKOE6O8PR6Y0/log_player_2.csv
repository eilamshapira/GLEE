"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given the current situation, let me analyze the options:

- Alice is offering the product at $150, which is more than the $100 it's worth to me.
- John (spelled ""Jhon"" in your message) is offering the product for $100, which is exactly what the product is worth to me.
- Alice's product is worth $120 to her, so there's potentially room for negotiation below her current offer.

Since Alice's initial offer is well above what the product is worth to me, and even above what it's worth to her, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has lowered her price from $150 to $135, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $135 is still above the $100 maximum I'm willing to pay (the product's worth to me). 

Since John is offering the product at exactly $100, and Alice's offer is still significantly higher, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.
