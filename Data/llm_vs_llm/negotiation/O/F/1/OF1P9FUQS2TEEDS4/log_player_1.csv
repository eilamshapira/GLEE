Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. Since I know I can definitely get $8,000 from John, I want to offer Bob a price that maximizes my potential profit while still having a reasonable chance of being accepted. Setting the price too high might lead to rejection, while setting it too low would mean leaving money on the table. Given that Bob doesn't know about my alternative option with John, I'll aim for a significantly higher price.
