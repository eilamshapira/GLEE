"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $30000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to offer $5000 for the product.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from. However, $5000 is too low for this product. How about we settle on $25000? I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",25000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $25000 is still far too high for me. My maximum budget for this product is $8000, and I'm already considering other options. I can offer $6000.",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your consideration, Bob, and I value your interest in the product. However, I need to ensure we both find a fair ground. Would you consider a price of $20000? I believe this product's value justifies this price.",20000.0,Alice,5,
