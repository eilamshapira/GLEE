Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2500000}

I propose this price because:
1. I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed fallback option with John at $1,000,000
3. By setting a higher price, I create room for potential higher profit if Bob values the product significantly more than my minimum
4. Even if Bob rejects this offer, I don't lose anything since I can still sell to John
5. $2.5 million is high enough to make a good profit but not so high that it would immediately seem unreasonable to a serious buyer"
