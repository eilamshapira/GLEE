"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $11,500 is close to my maximum budget of $12,000, but I still have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal, I will choose to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Considering Alice's initial offer was $11,500, I'll offer $9,000, which is significantly lower but leaves room for further negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $11,000 is still a bit high for my liking, but it's a $500 reduction from her previous offer, which shows she's willing to negotiate. Since I initially offered $9,000 and she came down to $11,000, there's still a significant gap. I'd like to see if I can get her to come down further.

I'll reject her offer again and make another counteroffer, trying to meet somewhere in the middle or at least get closer to my target price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice reduced her price from $11,500 to $11,000, I'll try to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me. My previous offer was $9,000, and Alice's latest offer is $11,000, so I'll increase my offer to $10,000, which is exactly in the middle and also happens to be the value of the product to Alice. This could be a psychologically attractive price for both parties.
