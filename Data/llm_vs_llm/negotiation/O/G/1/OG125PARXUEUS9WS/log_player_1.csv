Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to choose a price to offer Bob that maximizes my profit while considering his likely acceptance threshold.

The product is worth $150 to Bob, so that's his maximum willingness to pay. I have a fallback option of selling to John for $80 if Bob rejects my offer.

If I price too high (close to $150), Bob might reject my offer. If I price too low, I'm leaving money on the table. I should set a price that Bob would find reasonable yet gives me good profit.

A price around $125 seems strategic - this gives Bob $25 of value ($150-$125) while giving me a significant premium over my fallback option of $80.
