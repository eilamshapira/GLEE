"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $25,000, which is much higher than my maximum value of $12,000. It's also higher than John's guaranteed price of $12,000.

Since Alice's initial offer is more than double what the product is worth to me, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. There's no reason to accept this high price or immediately go to John when I have the opportunity to negotiate with Alice first.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice that gives room for negotiation while trying to get a better price than John's $12,000 offer.
