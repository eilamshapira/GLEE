"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to make a decision on Alice's offer of $12,000. Let me analyze:

1. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me.
2. Alice's offer ($12,000) exceeds my maximum valuation.
3. John is willing to sell me the same product for $10,000.

Since Alice's offer is higher than both my valuation and John's alternative price, there's no reason to accept it or continue negotiating.
