"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a product that I believe would be of great value to you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm pricing it at $9500. This represents a fair price considering the $10000 value you would receive from it. Would you like to proceed with this purchase?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000, considering I have another option for $10000 and I'm trying to save as much as I can. Would you be willing to sell it to me for this price?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal possible. However, I cannot accept $7000 as that's below my minimum acceptable price. The product is worth $10000 to you, which means my offer of $9500 already provides you with $500 in value. I'm willing to come down to $9000, which would give you a full $1000 in savings compared to your other option. This represents a fair split of the value between us. Would this work for you?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price to $9000. However, I still think there's room for negotiation. Considering the product is worth $8000 to you and $10000 to me, I'd like to propose a price of $8500. This way, we both get a fair share of the value, and I get to save $1500 compared to buying from John. Would you be willing to accept this offer?",8500.0,Bob,4,
