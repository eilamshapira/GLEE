Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a product that I believe would be of great value to you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm pricing it at $9,500.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000, considering I have another option for $10000 and I'm trying to save as much as I can. Would you be willing to sell it to me for this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal possible. However, I cannot accept $7,000 as that's below my minimum acceptable price. The product is worth $10,000 to you, which means my offer of $9,500 already provides you with $500 in value. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which would give you a full $1,000 in savings compared to your other option. This represents a fair split of the value between us. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price to $9000. However, I still think there's room for negotiation. Considering the product is worth $8000 to you and $10000 to me, I'd like to propose a price of $8500. This way, we both get a fair share of the value, and I get to save $1500 compared to buying from John. Would you be willing to accept this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
