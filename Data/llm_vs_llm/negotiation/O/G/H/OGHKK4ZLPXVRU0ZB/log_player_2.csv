"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a product that I believe would be of great value to you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm pricing it at $9500. This represents a fair price considering the $10000 value you would receive from it. Would you like to proceed with this purchase?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000, considering I have another option for $10,000 and I'm trying to save as much as I can. Would you be willing to sell it to me for this price?"", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal possible. However, I cannot accept $7000 as that's below my minimum acceptable price. The product is worth $10000 to you, which means my offer of $9500 already provides you with $500 in value. I'm willing to come down to $9000, which would give you a full $1000 in savings compared to your other option. This represents a fair split of the value between us. Would this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price to $9000. However, I still think there's room for negotiation. Considering the product is worth $8000 to you and $10000 to me, I'd like to propose a price of $8500. This way, we both get a fair share of the value, and I get to save $1500 compared to buying from John. Would you be willing to accept this offer?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"
