"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","$250 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $100 for the product, and it's also higher than John's offer. It doesn't make sense to accept this offer.

Since John is offering the product for $100 (which is equal to my maximum value), I could simply buy from him. However, I'll try negotiating with Alice first to see if I can get a better price.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has lowered her price from $250 to $200, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $200 is still double the price that John is offering and double my maximum value for the product.

It makes more sense to continue negotiating with Alice or buy from John at this point.

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's price is still decreasing (from $200 to $180), but it remains substantially higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's offer ($100). There's no reason to accept this offer.

I'll continue negotiating to see if Alice will come down further, but if she doesn't approach the $100 price point soon, buying from John would be the better option.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's price continues to decrease but very slowly (only $10 per round). At $170, it's still well above John's offer of $100 and my maximum value. 

Since we only have a few rounds left and Alice doesn't seem to be approaching the $100 mark quickly enough, it's becoming more rational to go with John's offer.
