"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $120 is above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). It would not be rational to accept this offer when I have a better alternative. I'll reject and make a counteroffer to Alice, knowing I can always fall back to John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

I'll offer $70, which is below John's price of $80. This gives Alice room to negotiate up while still potentially giving me a better deal than John's price. Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, this offer gives her the possibility of making some profit while giving me a chance to save money compared to my alternative option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $110 is still well above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). There's no reason to accept this offer when I have a better alternative. I'll reject and make another counteroffer to Alice, continuing the negotiation since we still haven't reached a mutually beneficial price point. If we can't reach an agreement, I can always take John's offer of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 75}

I'll slightly increase my offer to $75. This is still below John's price of $80, giving me room to save money, but also shows some movement towards meeting Alice in the middle. The offer would still allow Alice to make a profit (since the product is worth $100 to her) while being more attractive than my previous offer of $70. If Alice doesn't accept, I can always fall back on John's offer of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price that would be beneficial for me. Her latest offer of $105 is still well above my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). Since Alice's offers have only come down slightly each time and remain significantly above my alternative, it's best to end the negotiation and take John's offer of $80. This is the rational choice as it gives me the product at my maximum acceptable price point."
