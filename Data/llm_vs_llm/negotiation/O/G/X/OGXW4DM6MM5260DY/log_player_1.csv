Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since the product is worth no less than $80 to me, I will not accept Bob's offer of $70.

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. My counteroffer to Bob is $100.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new offer is: 
{""product_price"": 100}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 100}"
