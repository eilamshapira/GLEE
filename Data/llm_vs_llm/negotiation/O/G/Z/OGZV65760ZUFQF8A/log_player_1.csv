Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while still maintaining a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","I will reject Bob's offer of $10,000 because it's below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, and I can guarantee $15,000 by selling to John. However, before going to John, I'll try one more counteroffer with Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a new counteroffer of $20,000, lowering it from my initial offer to show some flexibility.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,500 is still below what I can get from John ($15,000), and Bob's increases in offers are relatively small, it would be most profitable to sell to John now. There's no guarantee Bob will reach or exceed $15,000 in future negotiations.
