Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your product, $14500 is quite steep for what I'm looking for. Based on my market research, similar products are selling for significantly less. I'd be willing to pay $12500 for it, which I believe is fair and would still provide you with a reasonable profit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $12,500 is too close to my bottom line. The quality and value of this product justify a higher price point. I can come down to $14,000, which represents a $500 discount from my initial offer. This is still below the market value for a product of this caliber, giving you excellent value."", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14000 is still higher than what I'm prepared to pay based on current market conditions. I understand you need to make a profit, and I respect that. I can increase my offer to $13000, which gives you a solid profit margin while fitting better with my budget. This seems like a fair middle ground between our positions. What do you say?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your continued interest in the product. While $13,000 is getting closer to an acceptable price, I'm still not able to go that low considering the product's true value and my investment in it. I can offer you $13,700, which represents a significant discount from my initial price. This is very competitive for a product of this quality and features. I hope we can find common ground and complete this deal successfully."", ""product_price"": 13700}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. We're definitely getting closer. I understand you need to make a reasonable profit on this transaction. Looking at the value proposition and my budget constraints, I can meet you at $13300. This represents a fair compromise between our positions and gives you a good return while still being within my range. I believe this is a win-win price point for both of us. What do you think?
