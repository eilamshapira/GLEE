"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you.  It's something I'm personally valuing at no less than $8000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500.  This is a significant opportunity to acquire something worth $10000 to you for a price just slightly above my minimum. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,1,
