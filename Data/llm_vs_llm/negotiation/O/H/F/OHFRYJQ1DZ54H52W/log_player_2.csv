"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you.  It's something I'm personally valuing at no less than $8000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500.  This is a significant opportunity to acquire something worth $10000 to you for a price just slightly above my minimum. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
