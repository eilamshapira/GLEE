"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1500000 is significantly above market value for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $800000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider $700000 for the product?",700000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $700000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I am willing to lower my price to $1300000, which is still a competitive offer considering the value of the product. Please let me know if this works for you.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $1300000 is still well above market value. I want to be transparent - I have a firm offer from another seller for $800000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer you $750000, which would allow us to close the deal immediately.",750000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your transparency, Bob. However, $750000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I understand your position, but I need to maintain a certain value for the product. I am willing to go down to $1250000, which is my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I will have to consider other buyers. Please let me know your decision.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
