Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1500000 is significantly above market value for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $800000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $1300000 is still well above market value. I want to be transparent - I have a firm offer from another seller for $800000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer you $750000, which would allow us to close the deal immediately.
