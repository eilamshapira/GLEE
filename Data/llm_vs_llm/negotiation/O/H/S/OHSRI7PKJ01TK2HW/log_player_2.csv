"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I believe will bring immense value to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to let it go for a price that I think is fair and reasonable. I look forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is close to the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000), but still slightly below it, I think I can try to negotiate a better price. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer might lead to a more favorable price for me.
