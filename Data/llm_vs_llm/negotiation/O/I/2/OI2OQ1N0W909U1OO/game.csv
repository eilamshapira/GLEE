"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand that you believe the product has great value, but the price is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $500000, considering my budget and the potential return on investment.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, your offer of $500000 is significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1200000, which represents the minimum value of this product to me. I would like to work with you, but I need a more competitive offer. I can come down to $1550000, which I believe is fair considering the quality and return on investment this product will provide you.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $1550000 is still a bit out of my reach. Considering the other buyer's offer of $1200000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this price reflects a fair value for the product, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is still well below what I can accept for this product. As I mentioned, I have John willing to pay $1200000, which is my absolute minimum threshold. If you're interested in acquiring this product, I need an offer that at least matches this amount. Given our negotiation, I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which still represents excellent value for the quality and potential return this product offers. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $1350000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to meet you closer to your minimum threshold of $1200000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1100000. This price reflects my serious interest in the product and my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
