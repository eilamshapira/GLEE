Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, your offer of $500,000 is significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1,200,000, which represents the minimum value of this product to me. I would like to work with you, but I need a more competitive offer. I can come down to $1,550,000, which I believe is fair considering the quality and return on investment this product will provide you."", ""product_price"": 1550000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $1550000 is still a bit out of my reach. Considering the other buyer's offer of $1200000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this price reflects a fair value for the product, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still well below what I can accept for this product. As I mentioned, I have John willing to pay $1,200,000, which is my absolute minimum threshold. If you're interested in acquiring this product, I need an offer that at least matches this amount. Given our negotiation, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still represents excellent value for the quality and potential return this product offers.
