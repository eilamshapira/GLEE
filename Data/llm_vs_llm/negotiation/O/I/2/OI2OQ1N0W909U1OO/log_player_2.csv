"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be of great value to you. Based on my assessment and market research, I'm offering this product at $1800000. This price reflects the quality and potential return on investment that this product will provide. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $1,800,000, which is above my budget of $1,000,000, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower, but still shows that I'm interested in the product.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand that you believe the product has great value, but the price is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $500,000, considering my budget and the potential return on investment."", ""product_price"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, your offer of $500000 is significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1200000, which represents the minimum value of this product to me. I would like to work with you, but I need a more competitive offer. I can come down to $1550000, which I believe is fair considering the quality and return on investment this product will provide you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice's new offer of $1,550,000 is still above my budget of $1,000,000. Since she mentioned that another buyer, John, is willing to pay $1,200,000, which represents the minimum value of the product to her, I'll make a counteroffer that is closer to my budget but still competitive.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $1,550,000 is still a bit out of my reach. Considering the other buyer's offer of $1,200,000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this price reflects a fair value for the product, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is still well below what I can accept for this product. As I mentioned, I have John willing to pay $1200000, which is my absolute minimum threshold. If you're interested in acquiring this product, I need an offer that at least matches this amount. Given our negotiation, I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which still represents excellent value for the quality and potential return this product offers. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice's new offer of $1,350,000 is still above my budget of $1,000,000. She mentioned that $1,200,000 is her absolute minimum threshold, and I'm willing to meet her closer to that point. I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one, but still below her minimum threshold.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to meet you closer to your minimum threshold of $1,200,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This price reflects my serious interest in the product and my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
