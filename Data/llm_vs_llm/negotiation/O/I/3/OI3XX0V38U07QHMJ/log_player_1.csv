Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make a strategic offer to Bob. Since I know I have a guaranteed $800,000 from John, I can be somewhat aggressive in my pricing to Bob while still maintaining a reasonable chance of acceptance.

{""product_price"": 1200000}

I chose this price because:
1. It gives me a significant premium over my guaranteed $800,000 from John
2. It's not so high as to be immediately rejected
3. If Bob's valuation of the product is higher than this, he would likely accept
4. If he rejects, I still have my guaranteed backup option with John"
