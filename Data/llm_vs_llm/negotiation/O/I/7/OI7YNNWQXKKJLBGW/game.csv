"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, I'm looking to spend considerably less. Considering its worth to me is $12000, I'm willing to offer $9000 for it. ",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price. However, $9000 is too low for me as the product is worth at least $12000. I can come down from my initial offer - how about $15000? This still gives you excellent value for a high-quality product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks, Alice. I appreciate the adjustment, but $15000 is still too high for my budget. My absolute maximum is $12000, and I'd prefer to get it for less. How about $10500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and I'm glad we're making progress. However, $10500 is still below what I can accept. You mentioned your absolute maximum is $12000, which is actually the minimum value I need to get for this product. I can offer it to you at exactly $12000, which would be fair for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
