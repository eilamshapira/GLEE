"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Let's see if Alice can come down significantly from her initial offer. Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, paying $25,000 is not an option. I'll also hold off on buying from John for now, as negotiating with Alice might lead to a better price.)

Counteroffer: $5,000"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 5000}

(Alice's new offer is still too high, as it's double the maximum value I'm willing to pay. I'll continue negotiating and make another counteroffer.)

(I'm increasing my offer to see if we can find a middle ground, but I'm still keeping it below my maximum.)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9500}

(Maintaining my offer at $9,500 to see if Alice is willing to accept it or to see how much lower she might go in her next counteroffer. This is likely my final offer before considering John's offer.)"

(Alice's offer is still significantly higher than the value I'm willing to pay. Since this is the second-to-last round, I'm better off buying from John for $10,000 rather than risking a higher price or not reaching an agreement with Alice in the final round.)"
