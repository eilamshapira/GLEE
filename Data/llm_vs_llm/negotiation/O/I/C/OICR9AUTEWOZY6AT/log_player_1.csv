Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my offer to maximize my earnings. Since the product is worth at least $100 to me, and I have a guaranteed $100 from John if Bob rejects my offer, I should set a price higher than $100.

However, I don't want to set the price too high and risk Bob rejecting it. Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll offer a moderate premium over my minimum acceptable price.
