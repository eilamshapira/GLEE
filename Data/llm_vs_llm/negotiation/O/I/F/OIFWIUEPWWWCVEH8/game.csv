"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you're willing to make an offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $140. It's a great product and I believe it's worth the investment. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $140 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to make a concession, but I still believe the product is worth more than $110. Let me know if $130 is something you'd be willing to consider.",130.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $125 is very close, but I'm really trying to stick to my budget. Could we settle at $120? That's the maximum I can go.",120.0,Bob,8,
