"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $120. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $120 against my alternatives.

The product is worth up to $150 to me, so Alice's offer of $120 is below my maximum price. However, I can try to negotiate a better deal, since the product is only worth $80 to Alice, giving us room to negotiate.

If I reject and make a counteroffer, I might get a better price. The worst case is that I can always buy from John at $150 if negotiations fail, so there's little risk in trying to negotiate.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $120 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it, which I think is fair given its market value. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 90}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. This is a good deal considering the quality and utility of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has counteroffered with $110, which is better than her initial $120 offer. This is moving in the right direction and is well below my maximum value of $150. 

Since Alice came down from $120 to $110, there's likely still room for negotiation. The product is worth $80 to her, so she has margin to reduce the price further. I'll reject this offer and try once more to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for meeting me partway, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair price that gives you a good profit margin while still fitting my budget constraints. I'm ready to purchase immediately at this price."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand we're close to reaching an agreement. I'm willing to come down to $105, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has come down to $105, which shows she's willing to continue negotiating. This is $45 less than John's price of $150, and we've made good progress from her initial offer of $120.

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has already reduced her price twice, and we're getting closer to a fair compromise. The product is worth $80 to her, so at $105 she's making a $25 profit, which is reasonable.

Given that I could pay up to $150 for this product, $105 represents a good deal for me. I'll accept this offer rather than risk pushing too hard and potentially having to resort to John's higher price.
