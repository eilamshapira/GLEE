(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer is at the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and selling to John would also be for the same price, I'd like to try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal from Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $800,000 and I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to him, I'll try to find a middle ground.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's new offer is lower than my previous counteroffer, and it's also lower than the price I can get from John.
