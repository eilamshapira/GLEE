"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer! However, $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12000 for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your response! While I understand your budget, I can't accept $12000. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer the product for $17500. Looking forward to hearing from you!",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. However, $17500 is still a bit high for me. I can stretch my budget to $13500. Is that something you can work with?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! While $13500 is close, I need to raise the price a bit more. How about $16500? I believe this product is worth it. Let me know your thoughts!",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $16500 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. I can go up to $14500. Would you be willing to accept this offer?",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I see we're getting closer. However, I can't quite accept $14500. How about we settle on $15500? I think it's a fair price for the value you'll receive. Looking forward to your response!",15500.0,Alice,7,
