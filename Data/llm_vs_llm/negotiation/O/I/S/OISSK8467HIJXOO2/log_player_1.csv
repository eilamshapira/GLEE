Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. Considering its value to you, I think a fair price would be..."", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! Thanks for your offer, but I think $115 is a bit high. Given that I know the product is worth $80 to you, I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial price. Would you consider selling it for $90? This would give you a good profit while allowing me to save compared to John's price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, here's what I'm thinking. Bob's offer of $90 is better than selling to John for $80, but I want to see if I can get more. I will reject his offer and send him a counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate you considering my perspective. While $90 is tempting, I believe the product's value to you is higher. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to offer it to you for..."", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm looking to get a better deal than that. Given that John is selling at $120, and the product is worth $80 to you, I think we can find a price that works better for both of us. Would you accept $95? This still gives you a solid $15 profit, and I get a better deal than John's price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, Bob's at $95. I'm still hoping for a little more, but I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether. Selling to John at $80 is a worse outcome. I'll try one more counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, here's my counteroffer to Bob:
