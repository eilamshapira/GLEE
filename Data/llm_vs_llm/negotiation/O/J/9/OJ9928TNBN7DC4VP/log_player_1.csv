Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. Since I know my minimum acceptable price is $800,000 (as I can sell to John for this amount), and I don't know Bob's maximum value, I should set a price significantly higher than my reservation price to maximize my potential profit. However, I don't want to set it so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected.

A reasonable approach would be to set the price at about twice my reservation price.
