Send your offer to Bob.,"{
    ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $130. Would you like to purchase it?"",
    ""product_price"": 130
}

Rationale (not part of message): I'm offering the product at $130 because:
1. I know the product is worth at least $120 to me
2. I know I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120
3. Bob values it at $100, so he will likely reject this offer
4. This is fine because I can then sell to John for $120, which is better than selling to Bob at any price below $120
5. There's a small chance Bob might accept $130 (though unlikely), which would be even better for me"
