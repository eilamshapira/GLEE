"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $14500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential value to you.",14500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I think $14500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to purchase the product for $11000.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11000 is too low considering the product's value. I can reduce my initial price to $13500, which represents a $1000 reduction. This is still a good deal for you given the product's worth.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to raise my offer to $12000.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you moving up in your offer. To meet you partway, I can come down to $12800. This is a very reasonable price considering the product's value, and it represents a significant reduction from my initial offer.",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"We're close to an agreement, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $12500? This seems like a fair compromise for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,6,
