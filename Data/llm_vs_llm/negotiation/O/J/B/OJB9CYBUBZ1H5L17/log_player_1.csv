"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $14,500.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I think $14500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to purchase the product for $11000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll send a counter-offer as $13,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer while still maintaining a good profit margin, considering the product's value to Bob is $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is too low considering the product's value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to raise my offer to $12000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll counter with $12,800. Bob has moved up in price, showing willingness to negotiate, and this new price point offers a good middle ground between our last positions while still maintaining a healthy profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you moving up in your offer. To meet you partway, I can come down to $12,800. This is a very reasonable price considering the product's value, and it represents a significant reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 12800}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're close to an agreement, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $12500? This seems like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $12,500. This is a good price that's well above my minimum threshold of $10,000, and the negotiation has reached a reasonable middle ground. Given that we've gone through several rounds and Bob has shown willingness to compromise, this is a fair deal for both parties."
