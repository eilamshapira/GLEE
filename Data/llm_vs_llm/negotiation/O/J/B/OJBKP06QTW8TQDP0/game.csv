"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can actually get this same product from another seller for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to offer the product for $80? This would save me some money compared to my alternative option and still allow you to make a sale.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $80 is significantly below my minimum.  Could you do $120? That's a fair compromise.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I need to be straightforward with you. I can purchase this exact product from John for $100, which is already my maximum budget for this item. If you can offer it for $90, I'd be happy to buy from you instead. This would save me a bit of money while allowing you to make the sale rather than losing it to another seller. Does that work for you?",90.0,Bob,4,
