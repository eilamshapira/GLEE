Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can actually get this same product from another seller for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to offer the product for $80? This would save me some money compared to my alternative option and still allow you to make a sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I need to be straightforward with you. I can purchase this exact product from John for $100, which is already my maximum budget for this item. If you can offer it for $90, I'd be happy to buy from you instead. This would save me a bit of money while allowing you to make the sale rather than losing it to another seller. Does that work for you?
