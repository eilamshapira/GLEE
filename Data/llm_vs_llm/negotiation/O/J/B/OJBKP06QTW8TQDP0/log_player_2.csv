"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $150. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given the information provided, Alice is offering to sell the product to me for $150, while I know that:
1. The product is worth at most $100 to me
2. I can buy the same product from John for $100
3. The product is worth $100 to Alice

Since Alice's offer of $150 is higher than both the product's worth to me and the alternative price available from John, it wouldn't make sense to accept this offer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can actually get this same product from another seller for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to offer the product for $80? This would save me some money compared to my alternative option and still allow you to make a sale."", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $80 is significantly below my minimum.  Could you do $120? That's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given the updated information:
1. Alice rejected my counteroffer of $80 and is now offering the product for $120
2. I know I can buy the same product from John for $100
3. The product is worth at most $100 to me

Since Alice's current offer of $120 is still higher than both the product's value to me and the alternative price from John, it makes more sense to either reject and make another counteroffer or buy from John directly.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I need to be straightforward with you. I can purchase this exact product from John for $100, which is already my maximum budget for this item. If you can offer it for $90, I'd be happy to buy from you instead. This would save me a bit of money while allowing you to make the sale rather than losing it to another seller. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
