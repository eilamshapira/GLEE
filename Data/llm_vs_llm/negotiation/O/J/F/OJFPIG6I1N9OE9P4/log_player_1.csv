"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that I know the product is worth at least $8,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at $8,000, I'll start with a relatively high price to test Bob's willingness to pay and leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","A $9,000 offer from Bob is actually quite good - it's $1,000 more than John's guaranteed offer. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Since this is a reasonable profit above my minimum price, I'll accept it.
