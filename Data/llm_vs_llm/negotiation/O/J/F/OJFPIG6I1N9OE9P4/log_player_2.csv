"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to carefully consider my options here.

Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is the exact maximum amount I'm willing to pay. However, this is also the same price that John is offering as my backup option.

Since Alice's initial offer doesn't provide any savings compared to my alternative option (buying from John), and I have the opportunity to negotiate for a potentially better price, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that gives me room to negotiate while still being reasonable.
