Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make an offer to Bob that maximizes my profit while ensuring he's likely to accept it.

Since Bob values the product at $15,000, that's his maximum willingness to pay. If I price it too high, he'll reject it and I'll have to sell to John for $12,000. I want to choose a price that:
- Is higher than my $12,000 minimum (my reservation value)
- Is lower than or equal to Bob's $15,000 maximum
- Gives Bob enough incentive to accept

A reasonable strategy is to offer a price that shares some of the potential surplus. The total possible surplus is $3,000 ($15,000 - $12,000). If I offer the product at $14,000, I capture $2,000 of this surplus while giving Bob $1,000 of value (since he values it at $15,000). This gives him a reasonable incentive to accept while maximizing my profit.
