"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'm offering for sale. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us. I'm thinking $15000 would be a fair starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
