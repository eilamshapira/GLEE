"Bob, I'm excited you're considering this product. It's truly exceptional, and I know it will be a valuable asset to you. I'm confident you'll be very pleased with it. I'm offering it to you for $14000.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $14000 is quite steep for my budget. Based on my research on similar products in the market, I believe $11000 would be a fair price that works for both of us. This still gives you a good profit margin while helping me stay within my budget constraints. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $11000 is a bit too low considering the unique value and benefits this product offers. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $13000.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving on the price, Alice. The product does look good, but I've been comparing similar options, and I need to be mindful of value. I can go up to $11800 which I think is reasonable given current market conditions. This gives you a solid return while helping me stay close to my target budget. Can we make that work?",11800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm hearing your concern about the budget. I am willing to work with you. How about $12500? This is the lowest I can realistically go while still recognizing the product's worth.",12500.0,Alice,5,
