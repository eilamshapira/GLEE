Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $14000 is quite steep for my budget. Based on my research on similar products in the market, I believe $11000 would be a fair price that works for both of us. This still gives you a good profit margin while helping me stay within my budget constraints. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you moving on the price, Alice. The product does look good, but I've been comparing similar options, and I need to be mindful of value.
