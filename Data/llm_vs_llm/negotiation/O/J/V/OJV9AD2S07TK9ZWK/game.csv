,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice. Thanks for your offer, but I think $145 is a bit steep for this product. From my research, I believe a fair price would be around $130. This would still provide you with a good profit while giving me a better deal than what I can get elsewhere. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your perspective and offer.  While $145 represents a fair price given its value, I'm willing to come down to $138. This offer allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great price compared to other options.  What do you say?",138.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still finding $138 a bit high for my budget. I could go up to $132, which would still give you a good profit margin above your cost. This would be a win-win for both of us. Does that work for you?",132.0,Bob,4,
