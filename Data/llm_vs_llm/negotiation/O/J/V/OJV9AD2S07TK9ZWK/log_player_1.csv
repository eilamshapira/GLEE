Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice. Thanks for your offer, but I think $145 is a bit steep for this product. From my research, I believe a fair price would be around $130. This would still provide you with a good profit while giving me a better deal than what I can get elsewhere. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still finding $138 a bit high for my budget. I could go up to $132, which would still give you a good profit margin above your cost. This would be a win-win for both of us. Does that work for you?
