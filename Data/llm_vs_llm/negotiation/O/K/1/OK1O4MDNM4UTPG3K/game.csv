"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that the initial price might be a bit high for you, but I believe the value of the product is much higher than your offer. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1800000? It's a fair price considering the product's quality and market demand.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000. I believe that's a fair offer, considering I can buy it from someone else for $1500000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
