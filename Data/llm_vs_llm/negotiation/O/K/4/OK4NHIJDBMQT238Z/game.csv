"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite steep for me. I've found the same product elsewhere for $80. But I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a middle ground. Would you consider selling it for $70? This would be more reasonable for my budget.",70.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm afraid $70 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a reasonable profit. How about we split the difference between my initial offer and your counteroffer? I'd be willing to sell it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,3,
