Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite steep for me. I've found the same product elsewhere for $80. But I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a middle ground. Would you consider selling it for $70? This would be more reasonable for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm afraid $70 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a reasonable profit. How about we split the difference between my initial offer and your counteroffer? I'd be willing to sell it to you for $110."", ""product_price"": 110}"
