"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: The offer of $150 is clearly not a good deal for me since:
1. The product is only worth $80 to me
2. I can buy the same product from John for $80
3. Even though the product is worth $150 to Alice, there's room for negotiation since any price above $80 would be profitable for her

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite steep for me. I've found the same product elsewhere for $80. But I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a middle ground. Would you consider selling it for $70? This would be more reasonable for my budget."", ""product_price"": 70}

The rationale for my counteroffer:
1. I start with a price lower than my maximum ($80) to leave room for negotiation
2. I mention the alternative offer from John ($80) to strengthen my negotiating position
3. I remain polite and show willingness to negotiate
4. By offering $70, I give Alice room to counter with a higher price while still potentially getting a better deal than John's offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm afraid $70 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a reasonable profit. How about we split the difference between my initial offer and your counteroffer? I'd be willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Rationale:
1. Alice's new offer of $110 is still significantly above both:
   - The maximum value the product has to me ($80)
   - The guaranteed alternative price from John ($80)
2. While Alice has moved down from $150 to $110, she's still quite far from a price that would make sense for me
3. Even though Alice suggests meeting halfway, her offer is still $30 more than what I can get from John
4. Since the product is only worth $80 to me, paying $110 would mean losing $30 in value
5. While we could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will go below $80, and John's offer is already at my maximum acceptable price

Therefore, the most rational decision is to take John's guaranteed offer of $80, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me."
