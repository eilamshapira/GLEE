"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly above both my maximum valuation ($800,000) and John's fixed price ($800,000), I should reject this offer. The product is only worth $800,000 to me, so paying $1,200,000 would be a poor decision. I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this price is still significantly above my maximum valuation ($800,000) and John's fixed price ($800,000). Since I have the option to buy from John at $800,000, I should not accept any offer from Alice that exceeds this amount.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down by $100,000 to $1,100,000, I'll increase my offer but still stay well below John's price to leave room for negotiation.
