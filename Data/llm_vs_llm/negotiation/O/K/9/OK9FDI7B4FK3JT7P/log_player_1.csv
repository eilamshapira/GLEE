Send your offer to Bob.,"Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price, there's no reason for me to sell to Bob for less. While the product is only worth $1,000,000 to Bob, I'll make an offer slightly above my minimum acceptable price:

{""product_price"": 1550000}

This price ensures that even if Bob rejects (which is likely since it's above his valuation), I still maintain my $1,500,000 from John. If Bob surprisingly accepts, I make even more."
