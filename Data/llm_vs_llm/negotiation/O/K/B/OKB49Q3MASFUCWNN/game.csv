"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $200 is too high for me. I know I can get this product from John for $100. I'd like to offer you $80 for it, which would give us both a fair deal.",80.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,180.0
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you coming back to me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 is too low. How about $180? It's a great product, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",180.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $180 is still much higher than what I'm looking for. Remember, I can get this from John for $100. I'd like to work with you instead, so I can offer $90. This would still give you a better deal than selling it at cost.",90.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, okay, I understand you want a good deal. I'm going to give you my absolute rock bottom price. How about $170? This is as low as I can go. Let me know what you decide.",170.0,Alice,5,,
