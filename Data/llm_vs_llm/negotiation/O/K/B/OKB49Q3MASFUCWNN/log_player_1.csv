Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $200 is too high for me. I know I can get this product from John for $100. I'd like to offer you $80 for it, which would give us both a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, I have to decide. My minimum is $150, and Bob's offer is only $80. I should reject Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer_price"": 180}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you coming back to me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 is too low. How about $180? It's a great product, and I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $180 is still much higher than what I'm looking for. Remember, I can get this from John for $100. I'd like to work with you instead, so I can offer $90. This would still give you a better deal than selling it at cost. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","This is getting tricky. Bob's offer is still far below my minimum of $150. However, I don't want to give up just yet. I'll make another counteroffer, but this is the last one. If he rejects this, I'm selling to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer_price"": 170}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my final counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, okay, I understand you want a good deal. I'm going to give you my absolute rock bottom price. How about $170? This is as low as I can go. Let me know what you decide."", ""product_price"": 170}"
