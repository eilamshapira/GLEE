"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $750000 is below the value that the product has to me. I would be more comfortable selling at $1250000. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
