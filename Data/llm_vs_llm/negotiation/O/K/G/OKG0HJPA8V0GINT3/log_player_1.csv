Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a incredible product that I'm willing to sell for no less than what it's worth to me. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. Are you interested?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

# Explanation

# The product is worth $1,000,000 to me, and Bob's offer of $750,000 is below this value. Therefore, it makes sense to reject Bob's offer.

# Since I can sell the product to John for $1,000,000, I should not accept any offer from Bob that is lower than this amount. However, there is still room for negotiation with Bob, as his offer indicates that he is interested in the product.

# By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that is higher than $750,000 but still potentially attractive to Bob. This way, I can try to sell the product for more than $1,000,000, which is my goal. If Bob ultimately does not offer an amount higher than $1,000,000, I can always sell the product to John for that amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $750,000 is below the value that the product has to me. I would be more comfortable selling at $1,250,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

# Explanation

# My counteroffer of $1,250,000 is higher than Bob's offer of $750,000. It splits the difference between my initial offer ($1,500,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($750,000).
# This counteroffer allows me to potentially 1) sell the product for more than $1,000,000 or 2) negotiate further with Bob."
