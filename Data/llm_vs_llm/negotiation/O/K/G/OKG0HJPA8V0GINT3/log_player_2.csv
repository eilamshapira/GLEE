"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a incredible product that I'm willing to sell for no less than what it's worth to me. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the offer of $1,500,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,000,000, I will reject Alice's offer. I will proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of negotiating a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still shows that I'm interested in the product. Since I'm not sure what the product is worth to Alice, I'll start with a relatively low offer and see how she responds.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 750000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $750000 is below the value that the product has to me. I would be more comfortable selling at $1250000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,250,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, I don't see a reason to accept Alice's offer or make another counteroffer that would still be above my budget.
