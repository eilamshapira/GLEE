"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a product that I know would be a valuable asset for you. Based on my understanding of the market and the product's worth, I'm offering it to you for $1350000. This is a fair price considering the product's true value of $1500000 to you, giving you a $150000 benefit. While I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at $1200000, I wanted to give you the first opportunity as I believe this would be a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
