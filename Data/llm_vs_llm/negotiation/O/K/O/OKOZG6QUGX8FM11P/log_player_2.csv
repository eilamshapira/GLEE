"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $150. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $100 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $150
3. John is willing to sell it for $100

Since Alice's offer ($150) is:
- Higher than what the product is worth to me ($100)
- Higher than John's price ($100)

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer. The rational decision would be to buy from John at $100, as this matches the product's value to me and is the lowest available price.
