"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! Given its unique value and potential, I'm setting the price at $1750000.  I believe this is a fair price reflecting the product's worth. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and discussing further.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1750000 is unfortunately a bit out of my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but my maximum price is $1400000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value I'm placing on the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $1400000 is a bit lower than what I had in mind, I'm willing to come down slightly. I'm proposing a price of $1600000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it still represents the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1600000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $1500000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
