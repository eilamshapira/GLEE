Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1750000 is unfortunately a bit out of my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but my maximum price is $1400000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value I'm placing on the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
