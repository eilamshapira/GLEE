"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that I know the product is worth $8,000 to Bob and $10,000 to me, and I have John's guaranteed offer of $10,000, I'll start with a high offer to test Bob's willingness to negotiate while maintaining my strong position.

{""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","I will reject Bob's offer of $7,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and it's even below the product's value to Bob ($8,000). Since I have a guaranteed offer from John at $10,000, and Bob's initial offer is quite low, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob countered with a very low offer of $7,000, but I know the product is worth $8,000 to him, I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still maintain a strong position given that I have John's $10,000 offer as backup.

{""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $7,500 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and I have a guaranteed offer from John at $10,000. Given that Bob's incremental increases are small ($500) and still far from my minimum, it makes more sense to end the negotiation and take John's offer.
