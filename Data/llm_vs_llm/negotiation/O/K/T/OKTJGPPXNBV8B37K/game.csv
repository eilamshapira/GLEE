"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I cannot accept $500000 as it's significantly below the product's true value. My minimum acceptable price is $1500000, which reflects the actual market value of this product. However, I'm willing to negotiate somewhat - I can offer it to you for $2200000, which is already a reduction from my initial price. This product has tremendous potential for the right buyer.",2200000.0,Alice,3,
