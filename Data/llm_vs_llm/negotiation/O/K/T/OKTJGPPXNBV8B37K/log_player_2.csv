"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm offering it for $2500000. This product represents a significant market opportunity with substantial return potential. What do you think of this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me. Alice is offering it for $2,500,000, which is way too high. I will reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a better price. Buying from John is always an option if Alice is unwilling to negotiate.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I will start with a low counteroffer to see how flexible Alice is.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I cannot accept $500000 as it's significantly below the product's true value. My minimum acceptable price is $1500000, which reflects the actual market value of this product. However, I'm willing to negotiate somewhat - I can offer it to you for $2200000, which is already a reduction from my initial price. This product has tremendous potential for the right buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $2,200,000 is still far too high, as the product is only worth $1,000,000 to me. I'll reject this offer as well. I will also not provide a counteroffer as it is likely that we will not be able to agree on a price. I will proceed to buy from John.
