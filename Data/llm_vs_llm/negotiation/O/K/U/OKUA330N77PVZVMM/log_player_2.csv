"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me (Bob).
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $200.
3. I can buy the same product from John for $100.

Since Alice's price ($200) is higher than the maximum value the product has to me ($100), and it's also higher than John's price ($100), the logical choice is to not accept Alice's offer.

Looking at my other options, buying from John for $100 makes the most sense since that's exactly what the product is worth to me at maximum.
