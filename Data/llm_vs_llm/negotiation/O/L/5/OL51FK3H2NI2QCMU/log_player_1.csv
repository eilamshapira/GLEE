Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. This is a fair price for what you're getting. Would you be interested?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $180 is above my budget for this product. I'm willing to purchase it for $130. Let me know if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob since $130 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I can still negotiate for a better price than John's $150 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I cannot go that low. The quality and value of this product justify a higher price. I can reduce my initial asking price to $165, which I believe is a fair compromise. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 165}"
