"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to consider my options carefully here.

Alice's offer is exactly $15,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. However, this is also exactly the same price that John is offering.

Since I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000, there's no reason for me to accept Alice's first offer at the same price. I should try to negotiate with Alice to see if I can get a better deal.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price to $14,000, which is $1,000 less than both her initial offer and John's fixed price. This is a better deal than what John is offering.

However, since we have more rounds of negotiation available and Alice has already shown willingness to lower her price, I should continue negotiating to potentially get an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has moved from $15,000 to $14,000, she's showing willingness to negotiate. I'll increase my previous offer but still try to get a better deal.

Since we still have several rounds left and Alice is steadily reducing her price, I'll continue negotiating to try getting an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I see Alice is willing to continue reducing her price, but in smaller increments now. I'll increase my offer to show good faith while still trying to get a better deal.

This is a good offer, but since we still have 3 more potential rounds of negotiation and Alice has consistently been willing to lower her price, I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get an even better deal.

Round 8

Since this matches my last offer and is a significant savings compared to the alternative, I should accept this offer rather than risk Alice changing her mind in the final round.
