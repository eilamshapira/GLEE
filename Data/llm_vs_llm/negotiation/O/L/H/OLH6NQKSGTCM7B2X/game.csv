"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $180 is far beyond what I'm willing to pay for this product. I'm willing to offer $50.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $50 is significantly lower than its value. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Let's meet somewhere in the middle.",150.0,Alice,3,

I can go up to $87.50.,87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, $87.50 is still short of the product's value. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a reasonable price. Let's try to bridge the gap.",130.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, $87.50 is my best offer. Considering I can buy the product elsewhere for $100, I'm only willing to increase my offer slightly to $95, which is my final offer.",95.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand $95 is your final offer, but considering the product's value and your mention of a $100 alternative, I'm willing to meet you at a price that's slightly above your offer. This is my final concession.",115.0,Alice,9,
