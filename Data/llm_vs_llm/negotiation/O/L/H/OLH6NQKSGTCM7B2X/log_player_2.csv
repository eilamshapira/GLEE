"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its exceptional quality and value, I'm starting with a competitive price. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","The product is worth no more than $100 to me. Alice's initial offer is $180, which is way too high. Buying from John is an option at $100, but since I have 10 rounds to negotiate, I will try to get a better price from Alice first.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is only worth $100 to me, I'll start with a significantly lower offer to see how flexible Alice is. I'll offer half of what I'm willing to pay, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $180 is far beyond what I'm willing to pay for this product. I'm willing to offer $50."", ""product_price"": 50}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $50 is significantly lower than its value. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice came down from $180 to $150, which shows she is willing to negotiate. I'll increase my offer from $50, but still keep it below my maximum of $100.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I see we're making progress, but $75 is still below the product's worth. I'm willing to make another adjustment to find a mutually beneficial price. Let's try to get closer to a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice lowered her offer to $140. It seems that Alice's price is slowly going down. I still have five rounds left. Buying from John is still better, so I will try to negotiate for a better price again.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll meet her halfway between my previous offer and my maximum price.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, $87.50 is still short of the product's value. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a reasonable price. Let's try to bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice is still far off from my maximum price of $100. I have 3 rounds left. Since I am only willing to pay $100, and I have the option of buying from John for $100, I will try to get her to agree to $100.

```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'm going to be firm with my final offer here.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand $95 is your final offer, but considering the product's value and your mention of a $100 alternative, I'm willing to meet you at a price that's slightly above your offer. This is my final concession. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's final offer is $115, which is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. Since this is round 9, I only have one round left to negotiate. I'm not going to get her down to $100, and I'm not willing to pay $115. I will buy the product from John.
