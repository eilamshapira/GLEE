# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $25000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your alternative option of buying from John for $10,000. There's no reason to accept such a high price.  You should reject the offer and see if Alice will come down."
