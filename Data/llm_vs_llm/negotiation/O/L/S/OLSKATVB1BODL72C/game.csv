"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $18000 is much higher than I can spend. I know the product is valuable, but my budget is limited. I could offer $10000 for it. This is a fair price considering my situation, and it would still give you a decent profit. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $10000 is too low for this product. I'm willing to negotiate and can offer it to you for $16500, which is a fair price given its value.",16500.0,Alice,3,
