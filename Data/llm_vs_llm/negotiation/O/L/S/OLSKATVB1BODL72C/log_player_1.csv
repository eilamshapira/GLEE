Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $18000 is much higher than I can spend. I know the product is valuable, but my budget is limited. I could offer $10000 for it. This is a fair price considering my situation, and it would still give you a decent profit. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
