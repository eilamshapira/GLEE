"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be very interested in. I can offer it to you for $18000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'll analyze this offer:

Alice is offering the product for $18,000, which exceeds:
1. The maximum value I place on the product ($12,000)
2. The fallback option from John at $12,000

This offer would result in a net loss of $6,000 for me (paying $18,000 for something worth $12,000 to me). Since I have the guaranteed option to buy from John at $12,000, and Alice's offer is significantly higher, I should reject this offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $18,000 is much higher than I can spend. I know the product is valuable, but my budget is limited. I could offer $10,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my situation, and it would still give you a decent profit. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $10000 is too low for this product. I'm willing to negotiate and can offer it to you for $16500, which is a fair price given its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'll analyze this updated offer:

Alice has reduced her price to $16,500, but this is still:
1. Higher than the maximum value I place on the product ($12,000)
2. Higher than John's guaranteed offer of $12,000

If I accept Alice's offer, I would be paying $4,500 more than the product is worth to me. Since I have the option to buy from John at exactly the product's value to me ($12,000), the rational decision is to buy from John.
