"Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer is $80, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and buying from John would also cost me $80, I might as well accept Alice's offer to avoid any potential hassle or difference in the product.
