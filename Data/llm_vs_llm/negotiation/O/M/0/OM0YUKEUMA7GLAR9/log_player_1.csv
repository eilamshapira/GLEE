"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Let me make an initial offer to Bob that's higher than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for potential negotiation.

{""product_price"": 1,800,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's even below the product's worth to him ($1,200,000), which suggests he's starting with a very low anchor. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, and Bob's offer is much lower than that, it's best to reject and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Given that Bob's initial counteroffer was quite low at $1,000,000, I'll reduce my initial offer but still keep it above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, hoping to find a middle ground.

{""product_price"": 1,650,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and the guaranteed offer from John. While Bob has increased his offer by $100,000, we're still too far apart, and I have a guaranteed better option with John. Since we've already gone through 4 rounds and Bob's offers are still well below my minimum, it's best to end the negotiation and take John's guaranteed offer.
