"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,200,000. It's also much higher than John's price of $1,200,000. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, as there's room for negotiation considering Alice's value is $1,500,000. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is below Alice's known value of $1,500,000, giving room for negotiation. While it's also below my maximum price of $1,200,000 (and John's price), starting low allows for back-and-forth negotiation. If Alice counters with a more reasonable price, we might be able to reach a deal that's beneficial for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,650,000 is still significantly above my maximum value of $1,200,000 and John's price. While Alice has reduced the price from her initial offer, it's still not competitive with John's option. I'll reject and make another counteroffer to try to reach a more reasonable price. If Alice doesn't come down to a price below $1,200,000 soon, I will likely choose to buy from John instead."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'll increase my previous offer to $1,100,000. This is a $100,000 increase from my last offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying below my maximum price of $1,200,000. The price is strategically set to be less than both John's price and Alice's value, leaving room for further negotiation. However, if Alice doesn't come down significantly in the next round, I might need to consider taking John's offer to avoid prolonging the negotiation unnecessarily."
