"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","The problem states that if I reject Alice's offer, I will buy the product from John for $100. Alice's offer is $100. Therefore, I can either accept Alice's offer and pay $100, or reject it and pay $100 to John. Since both options cost the same, I might as well accept Alice's offer.
