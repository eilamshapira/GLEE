"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Given the information, my analysis is as follows:

- Alice is offering the product for $140
- The product is worth at most $150 to me (Bob)
- John (an alternative seller) will sell it for $150
- The product costs Alice $120

Alice's offer of $140 is better than John's price of $150, saving me $10. However, since the product only costs Alice $120, there's room for negotiation to get a better price.

I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. This gives me the opportunity to potentially pay less while still having John's offer as a backup option.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's better than Alice's current offer but still gives her a decent profit margin.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I can see that Alice has lowered her price from $140 to $135, which shows she's willing to negotiate. Her new offer is still $15 less than John's price of $150, and gives her a $15 profit margin above her cost of $120.

While I could try to negotiate further, the current offer of $135 is reasonable and significantly better than the alternative ($150 from John). There's a risk that if I push too hard, negotiations could break down, and I'd have to pay more with John.

Given that we're making progress and $135 offers good savings compared to my alternative, I'll accept this offer.
