"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you for a competitive price. I've taken into consideration the product's worth and I'm starting with a price that reflects its value.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is intriguing, but $12000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. This is my maximum offer, as I can get a similar product from John for $8000. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $8500. I understand that $12000 was out of your budget, but I still believe the product's value is higher than your offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I can offer you a better price, but I need to ensure it's still reflective of the product's worth. I'm counteroffering at $11000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable selling it for.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $9500. This is a fair price, considering I can get a similar product elsewhere for $8000. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $9500. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial price. However, I still need to ensure that the sale price reflects the product's value. I'm counteroffering at $10200, which is a compromise between my previous offer and your revised bid. If we can't reach an agreement, I do have another buyer interested in the product at a price that works for me, so I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10200.0,Alice,5,
