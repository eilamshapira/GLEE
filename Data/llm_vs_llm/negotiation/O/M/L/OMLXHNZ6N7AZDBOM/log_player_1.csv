Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is intriguing, but $12000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. This is my maximum offer, as I can get a similar product from John for $8000. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $8,500 because it's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll make a counteroffer to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

My counteroffer: $11,000. This price reflects the product's value and gives Bob a chance to reconsider his budget."

I understand that $12,000 was out of your budget, but I still believe the product's value is higher than your offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $9500. This is a fair price, considering I can get a similar product elsewhere for $8000. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.

I reject Bob's offer of $9,500 because it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Since Bob is willing to meet me halfway, I'll make another counteroffer to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

My counteroffer: $10,200. This price is slightly lower than my previous offer, and I hope it will be more acceptable to Bob. If not, I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, which is becoming a more attractive option."
