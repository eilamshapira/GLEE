,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I do see the value in this product, $200 is quite a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it, as that's my maximum budget.  Let me know if you're open to that.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $200 might be out of your budget, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $180. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $180 is still a bit too high for me. I'm still committed to $80, as that's my firm limit.  If you're not open to that, I'll have to explore other options.",80.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to your budget, and I'm willing to compromise further. However, $80 is still too low for me. I'm offering the product for $160, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. If you're interested, let me know.",160.0,Alice,5,
