Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I do see the value in this product, $200 is quite a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it, as that's my maximum budget.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually agreeable price. My counteroffer will be $180. This is still below my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but also significantly higher than Bob's offer, as $80 is too low for me. 

{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $200 might be out of your budget, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $180. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 180}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $180 is still a bit too high for me. I'm still committed to $80, as that's my firm limit.  If you're not open to that, I'll have to explore other options.

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a middle ground. Since Bob's firm limit is $80 and my initial offer was $200, I'll try to bring my price down further while still being above the $150 minimum I'm willing to accept. My next counteroffer will be $160.
