Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Given the situation:

I have to decide between $11,000 from Bob or $8,000 from John.  I also know Bob values it at $15,000. While I'd *like* to get more, $11,000 is significantly better than my minimum of $8,000.

Therefore, I will **AcceptOffer**.
