"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer to decide if it's a good deal compared to my alternatives.

Alice is offering the product for $14,000. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, so this offer is below my maximum value. However, I know that the product is worth only $8,000 to Alice, meaning she has a $6,000 profit margin at her current offer.

My options:
1) Accept Alice's offer at $14,000
2) Reject and make a counteroffer (potentially getting a better price)
3) Buy from John at $15,000 (which is my worst option at $1,000 more than Alice's current offer)

Since I can always make a counteroffer and continue negotiating with Alice, and I still have the option to buy from John later if negotiations fail, I should reject this offer and try to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I want to make a reasonable counteroffer that has a good chance of being accepted while still saving me money. Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and she offered $14,000, I'll aim for a price that still gives her a decent profit but is more favorable to me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I see that Alice has reduced her price from $14,000 to $12,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is progress, but I should evaluate if I can get an even better deal.

The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and she's now offering it at $12,000, which would give her a $4,000 profit. My counteroffer of $10,500 was rejected, but Alice has moved down by $2,000, which suggests there's still room for negotiation.

Since she came down by $2,000, I think there's a good chance we can meet somewhere in the middle. I'm not in a rush to accept this offer yet, as I can still make another counteroffer. The $12,000 price is significantly better than John's $15,000, so I'm definitely not going with option 3.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $14,000 to $12,000, showing willingness to negotiate, I'll increase my previous offer to meet her partway. I'll aim for a fair price that still gives her a reasonable profit while saving me money.
