"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. Considering the product's worth to me, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6000.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you have a lower price point in mind, but I still believe the product's value is higher than your offer. I'm willing to slightly reduce my initial price, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $17000. This price takes into account the product's worth to me and shows my willingness to negotiate.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $7000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer and for trying to meet me halfway. I appreciate your willingness to increase your previous offer to $7000. However, I still need to sell the product for a price that better reflects its value to me. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'd like to counteroffer at $16000. This price is lower than my previous offer, and I hope it's more in line with what you're willing to pay. I'm open to further negotiation but need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer of $16000. I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable paying that price. Considering my previous offer of $7000 and your need to get a fair price, I'd like to propose a compromise of $7500. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a reasonable offer given the product's value to both of us.",7500.0,Bob,6,
