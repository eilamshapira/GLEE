Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. Considering the product's worth to me, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

I reject Bob's offer of $6,000 because it's significantly lower than the product's worth to me. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to reach a mutually beneficial price. My next offer will be $17,000, slightly lower than my initial offer, to show that I'm willing to negotiate."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $7000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

I reject Bob's offer of $7,000 because it's still below the product's worth to me. Although Bob is trying to meet me halfway, his offer is not close enough to my initial price or even the counteroffer I made. I'd like to make another counteroffer to try to reach a price that is more satisfactory to me. My next offer will be $16,000, which is a further reduction from my previous counteroffer, showing that I'm still willing to negotiate but need a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer and for trying to meet me halfway. I appreciate your willingness to increase your previous offer to $7,000. However, I still need to sell the product for a price that better reflects its value to me. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'd like to counteroffer at $16,000. This price is lower than my previous offer, and I hope it's more in line with what you're willing to pay.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer of $16000. I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable paying that price. Considering my previous offer of $7000 and your need to get a fair price, I'd like to propose a compromise of $7500. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a reasonable offer given the product's value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

I decide to sell the product to John for $15,000. Although Bob has increased his offer to $7,500, it's still significantly lower than the product's worth to me and far from a satisfactory price. Given that John is willing to buy the product for $15,000, which is closer to its value to me, I believe it's the best option to ensure I get a fair price. Continuing to negotiate with Bob may not yield a substantially better offer, and I risk losing the opportunity to sell to John if I wait too long."
