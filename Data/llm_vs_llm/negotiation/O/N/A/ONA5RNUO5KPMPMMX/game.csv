"Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be really interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $200. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand that $200 was too high. However, $50 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $150 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $75, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. If you're willing to sell it to me for that price, I'd be happy to make the purchase.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks again for your offer. I'm still aiming a bit higher, as I have a minimum I need to meet. How about $125? That's a good compromise between our offers.",125.0,Alice,5,
