"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $18000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $14000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $16500? That's a fair price for both of us.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $16500 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to go to $15500.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I can't quite go as low as $15500, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16000.  Let's close this deal!",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $16000 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $15750? This would be a fair price for both of us.",15750.0,Bob,6,
