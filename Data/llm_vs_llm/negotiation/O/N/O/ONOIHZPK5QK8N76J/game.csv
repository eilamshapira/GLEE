"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",60.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $60 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to lower my price to $125. Let me know if this works for you.",125.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 was too high for you. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer the product for $125. Let me know if this is more within your budget.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $70. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",70.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your increased offer. However, $70 is still below my minimum price. I can go down to $110 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",110.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see that we're still a bit apart on the price. I'm willing to further reduce my offer to $110. This is a good deal, and I believe it's fair for both of us. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $110 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle and offer $75. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",75.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. I can lower my price to $105, which is very close to my minimum. Let me know if this works for you.",105.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm trying to meet you halfway. I can offer the product for $105, which is just above my minimum price. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to lower the price. However, $105 is still a bit too high for me. Considering your previous message, I'm willing to make a serious offer of $78. This is very close to my maximum budget, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",78.0,Bob,8,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer. However, $78 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to go down to $102, which is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",102.0,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're close but not quite there yet. I can offer the product for $102, which is my final offer before I need to consider other options. Let me know if this is something you can agree to.",102.0,Alice,9,
