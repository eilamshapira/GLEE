"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $1200000 is at the very top of my budget. I have another seller, John, who is offering the same price. Since I'm looking to save where possible, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. This would allow me to proceed with you rather than your competitor. How does that sound?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your interest in the product. While my initial price reflected its exceptional quality, I understand the need for balance. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? I believe this price better reflects the value while keeping our deal competitive. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $1050000 is getting closer, but I'd like to meet somewhere between our positions. I can offer $975000, which would give us both a fair compromise - you'd be getting a good price for your product, and I'd be able to stay comfortably within my budget. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,
