Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $1200000 is at the very top of my budget. I have another seller, John, who is offering the same price. Since I'm looking to save where possible, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. This would allow me to proceed with you rather than your competitor. How does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

While my initial price reflected its exceptional quality, I understand the need for balance. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $1050000 is getting closer, but I'd like to meet somewhere between our positions. I can offer $975000, which would give us both a fair compromise - you'd be getting a good price for your product, and I'd be able to stay comfortably within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
