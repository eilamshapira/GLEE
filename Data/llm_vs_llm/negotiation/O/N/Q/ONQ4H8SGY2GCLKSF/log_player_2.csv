"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you our exclusive product for $1200000. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Based on Alice's offer, I see that she is offering the product at $1,200,000, which is the maximum amount the product is worth to me. This is also the same price that John is offering as an alternative.

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price, and there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer immediately, I should try to negotiate with Alice to see if I can get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $1,200,000 is at the very top of my budget. I have another seller, John, who is offering the same price. Since I'm looking to save where possible, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. This would allow me to proceed with you rather than your competitor. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your interest in the product. While my initial price reflected its exceptional quality, I understand the need for balance. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? I believe this price better reflects the value while keeping our deal competitive. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer to $1,050,000, which is $150,000 less than both her initial price and John's alternative price. This is a good improvement, but I should try to negotiate further to save more money if possible.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer, but I'd like to meet somewhere between our positions. I can offer $975,000, which would give us both a fair compromise - you'd be getting a good price for your product, and I'd be able to stay comfortably within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}"
