"Round 1

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is way too high! It's much higher than John's price, and there's plenty of room for negotiation. Let's see if we can get a more reasonable offer from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 5000} 

Let's start with a lowball offer. This gives us plenty of space to negotiate upwards while staying well below John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $24,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $24,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice barely budged! This indicates she might be willing to go much lower. We still have plenty of rounds to negotiate, so let's keep going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 7500} 

We'll increase our offer slightly to show Alice we're willing to negotiate, but we're still staying well below her current offer. Let's see how she responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $23,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $23,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but at a snail's pace.  We're still way above John's price.  Time to apply a little more pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 10000} 

Let's try anchoring our offer to John's price. This will show Alice we have a viable alternative and might encourage her to be more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is sticking to her slow descent, but we're still not getting anywhere near a reasonable price. We're getting closer to the point where buying from John makes more sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 11000}

Let's show some flexibility and edge a bit above John's price. This might be our last offer before we jump ship to John, so hopefully, it entices Alice to make a serious counter."
