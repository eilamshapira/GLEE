"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","If Alice is offering the product for $200, but I know the product is worth at most $150 to me, and I can buy it from John for $150, it doesn't make sense to accept Alice's current offer.

I should either reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer (to try to get it for less than $150), or simply buy from John at $150. Since I can always buy from John at $150, I'll try negotiating with Alice first.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's $200 price, but still reasonable enough to start a negotiation.

{""product_price"": 110}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has lowered her price from $200 to $180, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $180 is still above the $150 I can pay to John, so there's no reason to accept this offer yet.

I'll reject this offer and continue the negotiation since I can always fall back to buying from John at $150 if needed.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $200 to $180, showing some flexibility, I'll increase my offer slightly but still stay well below my maximum price point of $150.

{""product_price"": 125}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has come down further to $165, which is getting closer to John's price of $150. However, since I can still buy from John for $150, and that's the maximum value I place on the product, there's no reason to accept an offer above $150.

I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating since Alice seems to be moving in the right direction.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has been moving down in her price (from $200 to $180 to $165), showing she's willing to negotiate further. I'll increase my offer a bit more but still stay below John's price of $150.

{""product_price"": 135}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's offer has come down to $155, which is very close to John's price of $150. However, since I can still buy from John for $150, and the product is worth no more than $150 to me, I should reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has continued to lower her price and is now at $155, which is very close to John's price of $150. Given the pattern of our negotiation and how close we are, I'll make one final reasonable counteroffer.

{""product_price"": 145}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has now offered $150, which is exactly the same price that John is offering and exactly what the product is worth to me. At this point, I'm indifferent between buying from Alice or John since the price is the same.

I'll accept Alice's offer since we've already invested time in this negotiation, and there's no advantage to switching to John now.
