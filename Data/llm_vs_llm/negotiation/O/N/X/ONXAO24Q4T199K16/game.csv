"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $95 seems a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65? I think that's a fair price.",65.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is too low for this product's value. I understand $95 might have been high for you, so I can reduce it to $88. This is a very competitive price considering the product's quality, and it's much closer to what you're looking for.",88.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?  That's a solid offer.",75.0,Bob,4,
