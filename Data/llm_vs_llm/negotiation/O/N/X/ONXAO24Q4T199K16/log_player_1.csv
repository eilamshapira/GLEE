Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $95. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $95 seems a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer because:
1. Bob's offer of $65 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80
2. While I have John's guaranteed offer of $80, I might still get a better price from Bob
3. Bob's willingness to negotiate suggests there might be room for a price between $65 and $95

I'll continue negotiating to try to secure a better price than John's $80 offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is too low for this product's value. I understand $95 might have been high for you, so I can reduce it to $88. This is a very competitive price considering the product's quality, and it's much closer to what you're looking for."", ""product_price"": 88}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?  That's a solid offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John because:
1. Bob's offer of $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80
2. John's guaranteed offer of $80 is better than Bob's current offer
3. Based on the negotiation pattern, it seems unlikely Bob will exceed $80, as he's only moved up by $10 from his initial offer
4. Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob walking away, while John's offer is guaranteed"
