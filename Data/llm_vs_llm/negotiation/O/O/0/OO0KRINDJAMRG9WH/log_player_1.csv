Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $9,000 since it's below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 (and we already have John's guaranteed offer at $10,000). However, since Bob values the product at $12,000, I'll continue negotiating rather than immediately selling to John.

However, I notice Bob is gradually increasing his offers, so I'll continue negotiating with a slightly lower price than my previous offer.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer is now equal to John's offer ($10,000), and Bob has shown willingness to increase his price through multiple rounds of negotiation, I believe there's still room to negotiate for a better price with Bob. The product is worth $12,000 to him, so he has room to go higher.
