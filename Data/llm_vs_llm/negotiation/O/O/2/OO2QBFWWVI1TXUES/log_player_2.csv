"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $1,500,000, which is higher than my valuation
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $1,200,000, which matches my maximum valuation

Alice's offer of $1,500,000 exceeds what the product is worth to me, and it's also $300,000 more than John's guaranteed price. There's no reason to accept this offer or continue negotiating when I have a guaranteed option at my maximum valuation.
