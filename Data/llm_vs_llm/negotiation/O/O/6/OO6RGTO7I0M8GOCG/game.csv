"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $30000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000, considering I can also buy it from another seller for $12000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but given the quality and market value of this product, I cannot accept $10000. My next offer is $17500. I believe this price reflects the premium quality you’re looking for. Please let me know if this works for you.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that the product is of high quality, but $17500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and yours. How about $12250? This is very close to the price I can get it from another seller, and I'd prefer to buy from you if we can agree on a price.",12250.0,Bob,4,
