Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $30000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000, considering I can also buy it from another seller for $12000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that the product is of high quality, but $17500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and yours. How about $12250? This is very close to the price I can get it from another seller, and I'd prefer to buy from you if we can agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250.
