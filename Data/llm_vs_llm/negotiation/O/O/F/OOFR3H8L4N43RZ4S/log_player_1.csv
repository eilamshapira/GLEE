Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $500000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate and try to reach a better price. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a guaranteed option, but I want to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob. 

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.
