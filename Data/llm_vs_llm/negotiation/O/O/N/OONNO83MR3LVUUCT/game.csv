"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $25000. This is a competitive price for the product's features and benefits. Would you like to proceed with the purchase?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $10000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. Would you consider this offer?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $10000 as it's significantly below the product's value. While I understand budget constraints, my product comes with superior quality and features that justify a higher price. I can reduce my initial asking price to $20000, which represents a $5000 reduction from my original offer. This is still a competitive price considering the product's market value. Would you consider this revised offer?",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $20000 is still well above my budget. I need to be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $12000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I can offer $11000, which is a fair price and close to the market rate. Would this work for you?",11000.0,Bob,4,
