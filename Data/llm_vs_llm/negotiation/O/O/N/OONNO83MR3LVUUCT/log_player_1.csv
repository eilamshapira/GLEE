Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $25,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $10000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and it's also less than what John is willing to pay. I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, as there might still be room for negotiation to reach a better price than John's $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $10,000 as it's significantly below the product's value. While I understand budget constraints, my product comes with superior quality and features that justify a higher price. I can reduce my initial asking price to $20,000, which represents a $5,000 reduction from my original offer. This is still a competitive price considering the product's market value. Would you consider this revised offer?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $20000 is still well above my budget. I need to be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $12000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I can offer $11000, which is a fair price and close to the market rate. Would this work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $15,000. Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and while he mentions another seller at $12,000, that's still less than John's guaranteed $15,000. Given that Bob's second offer only increased by $1,000, it seems unlikely that we'll reach a price above $15,000 in further negotiations. Therefore, the most profitable decision is to take John's certain offer of $15,000."
