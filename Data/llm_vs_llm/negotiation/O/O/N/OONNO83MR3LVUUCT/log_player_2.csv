"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $25000. This is a competitive price for the product's features and benefits. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price offered by Alice ($25,000) is significantly higher than my maximum value for the product ($12,000) and also higher than John's price ($12,000). It would be reasonable to reject this offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price. If Alice doesn't come down to an acceptable price, I can always buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $10000 as it's significantly below the product's value. While I understand budget constraints, my product comes with superior quality and features that justify a higher price. I can reduce my initial asking price to $20000, which represents a $5000 reduction from my original offer. This is still a competitive price considering the product's market value. Would you consider this revised offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $20,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000). While she did reduce the price by $5,000, it's still not in my acceptable range. I'll reject this offer and try one more counter-offer before considering John's option."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $20,000 is still well above my budget. I need to be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $12,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I can offer $11,000, which is a fair price and close to the market rate. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
