Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine the optimal price to offer Bob for the product.

Given information:
- The product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me (Alice)
- The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob
- If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell to John for $1,200,000

Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, he won't accept any price above that. And since I can get $1,200,000 from John, I should never sell to Bob for less than $1,200,000.

Since $1,200,000 > $1,000,000, Bob would reject any profitable offer I could make. Therefore, my best strategy is to offer a price that I know Bob will reject, allowing me to sell to John instead.

{""product_price"": $1,200,000}"
