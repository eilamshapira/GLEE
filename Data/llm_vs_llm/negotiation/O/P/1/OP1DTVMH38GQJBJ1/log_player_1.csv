Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000}

Rationale: Since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay this amount, there's no reason to offer Bob a lower price. Even though the product is only worth $800,000 to Bob, if I offer it at $1,000,000, I'm not worse off if he rejects it because I can still sell it to John for the same amount. This maximizes my potential earnings while maintaining my minimum acceptable value."
