Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential value to you."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering other viable options and the current market alternatives, I'm prepared to offer $9000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your proposal, I need to get closer to my target price.
