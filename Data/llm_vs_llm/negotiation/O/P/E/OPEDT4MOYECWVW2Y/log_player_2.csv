While $120 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation. I'll try to get a better deal from Alice before settling."

Alice is negotiating in smaller increments now, so the price is unlikely to drop much further.  $110 is a reasonable price, and I'd rather secure the deal now than risk it going up or reaching a stalemate."
