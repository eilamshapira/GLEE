Send your offer to Bob.,"In this case, I need to consider that:
1. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer of $1,200,000 from John
3. The product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me

Since I already have a guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 from John, and the product is worth exactly $1,000,000 to Bob, there's no price point where both Bob and I would benefit from the transaction. Any price above $1,000,000 would be rejected by Bob, and any price below $1,200,000 would give me less than my guaranteed alternative.

Therefore, I will make an offer that I know Bob will reject, so I can proceed with selling to John.
