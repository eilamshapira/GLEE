"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than John's price of $800,000, and since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, it makes no sense to pay more than that. The best decision is to buy from John immediately rather than continue negotiations with Alice, as her initial offer is more than twice what I'm willing to pay."
