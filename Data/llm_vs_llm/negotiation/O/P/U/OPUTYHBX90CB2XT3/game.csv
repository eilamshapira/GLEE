"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While $1200000 is lower than my alternative option, I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. The product is valuable to me, but I'm looking to keep my costs lower. I can offer $900000 for the product. This gives you an immediate sale without the uncertainty of finding another buyer. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest in the product, $900000 is below what I believe is fair for both of us given the value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $1100000 to make this work for you. What are your thoughts on this?",,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. That shows you're willing to work with me. I'm still looking to keep my costs lower given my budget constraints. Could we meet in the middle at $1000000? This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and would allow us to conclude this deal promptly without either of us having to look for other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours at $1050000. This should be a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth while respecting your budget. What do you say?",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
