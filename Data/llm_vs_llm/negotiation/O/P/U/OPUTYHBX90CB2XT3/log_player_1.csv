Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While $1200000 is lower than my alternative option, I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. The product is valuable to me, but I'm looking to keep my costs lower. I can offer $900000 for the product. This gives you an immediate sale without the uncertainty of finding another buyer. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. That shows you're willing to work with me. I'm still looking to keep my costs lower given my budget constraints.
