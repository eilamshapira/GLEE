"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $10000 is more than I can pay. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I actually have another option to purchase it from John at exactly $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a better price. Would you consider $7000 for the product?",7000.0,Bob,2,
