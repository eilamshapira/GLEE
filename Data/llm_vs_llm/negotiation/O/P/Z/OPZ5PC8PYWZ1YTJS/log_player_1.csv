"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $10000 is more than I can pay. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I actually have another option to purchase it from John at exactly $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a better price. Would you consider $7000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
