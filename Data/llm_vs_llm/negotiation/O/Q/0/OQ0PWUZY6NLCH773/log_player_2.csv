"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an exclusive product that I believe you will find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000, which is more expensive than both my maximum budget ($1,200,000) and the alternative option from John who is selling it for $1,200,000.

Since Alice's offer exceeds what the product is worth to me, and I have a better alternative available, I should not accept her offer.
