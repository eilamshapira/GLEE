"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product for $1300000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it represents a strong investment opportunity. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer ($1,300,000) is higher than both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000), it would not be rational to accept it. Given that John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value, and any further negotiation with Alice might not guarantee a better price, the most logical decision is to buy from John.
