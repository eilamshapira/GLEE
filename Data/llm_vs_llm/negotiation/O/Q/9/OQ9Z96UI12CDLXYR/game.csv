"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $13500 is a bit high for me. Considering the product's value, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal if we can meet at this point.",10000.0,Bob,2,
"I appreciate your interest and counteroffer, Bob, but $10000 is too low for this product's value. I'd like to counter with $12000, which I believe is a more reasonable price considering the product's quality and market value.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
