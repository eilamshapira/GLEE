"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product is interesting, $20000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $18000, considering its exceptional quality and the value it can bring. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe $18000 is a more suitable price.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $18000 is still above my budget. Could we agree on $13000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. Let's discuss a price of $15500. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's quality and the value it can bring to you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
