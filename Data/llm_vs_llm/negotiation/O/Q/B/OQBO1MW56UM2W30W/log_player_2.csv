Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $18000, considering its exceptional quality and the value it can bring.

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. Let's discuss a price of $15500. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's quality and the value it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

Alice is clearly holding out for a higher price, and while she might come down slightly again, it's unlikely to be enough to make it worthwhile.  John's offer of $15,000 is a sure thing and saves me the hassle of further negotiation."
