"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2300000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $2300000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. While I understand your perspective, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1900000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the true worth of what's on the table.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $1900000 is still too high for me. I can stretch my budget to $1100000. Is this something you can consider?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to accept $1600000 for the product.  This is a firm offer, as I believe it reflects the true value while acknowledging your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $1600000 is still outside my budget. The highest I can go is $1150000. Can we close the deal at this price?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the gap between our valuations remains significant.  My final offer is $1450000.  This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer - I believe it's more than fair, and I'm confident I can find other buyers at this price point.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1450000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1175000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. If this works for you, we can close the deal now.",1175000.0,Bob,8,
