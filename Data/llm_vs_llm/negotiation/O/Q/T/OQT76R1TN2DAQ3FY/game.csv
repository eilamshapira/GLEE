"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is significantly above my budget. I'm looking for something more affordable. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $8000 for the product. This is a fair price that works within my budget while still providing good value.",8000.0,Bob,2,
