Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product at $25,000. I believe it offers excellent value. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is significantly above my budget. I'm looking for something more affordable. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $8000 for the product. This is a fair price that works within my budget while still providing good value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
