"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product at $25000. I believe it offers excellent value. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer because $25,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $10,000. It's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $10,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, starting much lower to leave room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm looking for something more affordable. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $8,000 for the product. This is a fair price that works within my budget while still providing good value."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
