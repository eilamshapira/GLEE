"Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its value and significance, I'm prepared to offer it to you for a price of $950000. Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $950000 is quite high considering market conditions. The product is worth around $800000, and I'd be willing to pay $825000 for it. This gives you a fair profit while still being reasonable for me. What do you think?",825000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, I believe the true value is higher than $825000. Considering the product's unique qualities and its value to you, I'm willing to lower my price to $925000. This is still a good deal for you, and gives me a reasonable profit. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, there's still quite a gap between our positions. I understand you need to make a profit, but I also need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $850000, which would give you a $50000 profit on your $800000 value. This is a fair deal that benefits both of us. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement without me having to explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. While $850000 is getting closer, I'm confident that the product is worth a bit more, especially considering its value to you. To bridge the gap, I'll offer it to you for $900000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and ensures a substantial profit for me. I'm hopeful we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thanks for continuing to work with me on this, Alice. I can see we're getting closer. Your offer of $900000 is still quite high compared to the product's value of $800000 to you. Let's meet in the middle - I'm prepared to offer $875000, which gives you a very healthy $75000 profit. This is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. We're running out of negotiation rounds, and I'd prefer to close this deal with you rather than going to John, but I need to see more movement from your side.",875000.0,Bob,6,
