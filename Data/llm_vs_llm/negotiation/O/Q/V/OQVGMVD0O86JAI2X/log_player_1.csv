"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its value and significance, I'm prepared to offer it to you for a price of $950,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $950000 is quite high considering market conditions. The product is worth around $800000, and I'd be willing to pay $825000 for it. This gives you a fair profit while still being reasonable for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Okay, I need to evaluate Bob's offer. He's offering $825,000. My minimum is $800,000.

Given the potential for more money, I'll reject his offer for now and try to get a better price.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, I believe the true value is higher than $825,000. Considering the product's unique qualities and its value to you, I'm willing to lower my price to $925,000. This is still a good deal for you, and gives me a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, there's still quite a gap between our positions. I understand you need to make a profit, but I also need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $850000, which would give you a $50000 profit on your $800000 value. This is a fair deal that benefits both of us. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement without me having to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Okay, Bob is now offering $850,000. This is a profit of $50,000 over my minimum. I still believe I can get a bit more. Let's try one more counteroffer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. While $850,000 is getting closer, I'm confident that the product is worth a bit more, especially considering its value to you. To bridge the gap, I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and ensures a substantial profit for me. I'm hopeful we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for continuing to work with me on this, Alice. I can see we're getting closer. Your offer of $900000 is still quite high compared to the product's value of $800000 to you. Let's meet in the middle - I'm prepared to offer $875000, which gives you a very healthy $75000 profit. This is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. We're running out of negotiation rounds, and I'd prefer to close this deal with you rather than going to John, but I need to see more movement from your side. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Okay, Bob is now offering $875,000. This is a significant improvement, and it's a good profit for me. However, we are running out of time. I have to consider the risk of not closing the deal with Bob and having to settle for $800,000 from John. I also have to consider the value of the product to Bob. Given that I have to act quickly, I will accept the offer.
