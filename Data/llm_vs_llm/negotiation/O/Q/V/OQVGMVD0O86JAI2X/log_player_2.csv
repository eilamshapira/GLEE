"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its value and significance, I'm prepared to offer it to you for a price of $950000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I can see that Alice's offer is to sell the product for $950,000. This is less than the $1,000,000 maximum I'm willing to pay, but I should try to get a better deal since the product is only worth $800,000 to Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $950,000 is quite high considering market conditions. The product is worth around $800,000, and I'd be willing to pay $825,000 for it. This gives you a fair profit while still being reasonable for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, I believe the true value is higher than $825000. Considering the product's unique qualities and its value to you, I'm willing to lower my price to $925000. This is still a good deal for you, and gives me a reasonable profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I see that Alice has reduced her price slightly to $925,000, which is still well above the $800,000 value to her. I should continue negotiating to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, there's still quite a gap between our positions. I understand you need to make a profit, but I also need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $850,000, which would give you a $50,000 profit on your $800,000 value. This is a fair deal that benefits both of us. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement without me having to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. While $850000 is getting closer, I'm confident that the product is worth a bit more, especially considering its value to you. To bridge the gap, I'll offer it to you for $900000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and ensures a substantial profit for me. I'm hopeful we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has come down to $900,000, which shows we're making progress in the negotiation. This is $100,000 less than the alternative of buying from John, but I still think there's room to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for continuing to work with me on this, Alice. I can see we're getting closer. Your offer of $900,000 is still quite high compared to the product's value of $800,000 to you. Let's meet in the middle - I'm prepared to offer $875,000, which gives you a very healthy $75,000 profit. This is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. We're running out of negotiation rounds, and I'd prefer to close this deal with you rather than going to John, but I need to see more movement from your side."", ""product_price"": 875000}"
