"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'm considering Alice's offer of $1,450,000 for the product.

The product is worth up to $1,500,000 to me, and if I reject Alice's offer, my alternative is to buy from John for $1,500,000.

Alice's offer is $50,000 less than John's price, so it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer and save $50,000.
