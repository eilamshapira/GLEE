"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","In this case, Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's price ($1,500,000), and it's also equal to my maximum valuation of the product ($1,500,000). Since there's no difference in price between Alice and John's offers, and both meet my maximum price point, I might as well accept Alice's offer.
