"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80. I think it's a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal if we can meet at this price.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  $80 is quite low for this product considering its value. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd like to make another counteroffer. Considering we both want to find a mutually beneficial price, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about we do $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $120 as a final offer. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the discount you're offering, but $120 is still above my budget. You mentioned this is a final offer, but I'd like to make one more attempt to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering I can get the product from another seller for $100, I'm willing to meet you at $100, which is the highest I'm comfortable paying. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I can't sell this product for less than $110. This is my absolute final offer, as it's already a significant reduction from my original asking price. I believe this product is worth the investment, and I'm confident you won't regret it. ",110.0,Alice,7,
