"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you today. Based on its features and value, I'm offering it at $150. This product is worth at least $100 to me, and I believe it would be a valuable addition for you. Would you like to purchase it at this price?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to counter with $100. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $100 is the absolute minimum value for me, and I would be making no profit at that price. Given the quality and value of this product, I can come down to $130, which I believe is a fair compromise. Would this work for you?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $110? I think this could be a good middle ground for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,AcceptOffer
