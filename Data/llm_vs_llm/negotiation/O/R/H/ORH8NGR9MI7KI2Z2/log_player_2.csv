# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you today. Based on its features and value, I'm offering it at $150. This product is worth at least $100 to me, and I believe it would be a valuable addition for you. Would you like to purchase it at this price?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $100 is the absolute minimum value for me, and I would be making no profit at that price. Given the quality and value of this product, I can come down to $130, which I believe is a fair compromise. Would this work for you?
