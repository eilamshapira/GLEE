"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product and I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a high offer.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $800,000 is lower than the minimum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,500,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I still want to try to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a higher price, so I won't sell to John just yet.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $800,000, which is significantly lower than my initial offer of $3,000,000, I'll try to find a middle ground while still aiming high. I'll reduce my price, but not too much, to see if Bob is willing to meet me closer to my target.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $950,000 is still lower than the minimum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me. Since I have the option to sell it to John for $1,500,000, which is higher than Bob's offer, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I'll give Bob another chance to increase his offer, so I won't sell to John just yet.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer increased to $950,000, I'll try to encourage him to go even higher. I'll reduce my price slightly, but still aim to get a good deal.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $1,100,000 is still lower than the minimum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me, but it's getting closer. However, since I have the option to sell it to John for $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer, I will not accept Bob's offer. I'll give Bob another chance to increase his offer, but I'm starting to think that selling to John might be the better option if Bob doesn't increase his offer substantially.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer is $1,100,000, I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and the price I'm aiming for. I'll reduce my price slightly, but still try to get a good deal.
