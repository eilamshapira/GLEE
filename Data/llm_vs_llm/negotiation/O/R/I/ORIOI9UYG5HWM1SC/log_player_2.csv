"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $3,000,000 is way above my maximum value of $1,200,000. It would not make sense to accept this offer when I can buy from John for $1,200,000. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's substantially lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 800000}

This counteroffer of $800,000 is significantly below John's price of $1,200,000, giving me room to negotiate upward if necessary while still potentially saving money compared to buying from John. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground that's below John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $2,500,000 is still more than twice my maximum value of $1,200,000. While she has reduced the price from her initial offer, it's still far above what I could pay, and significantly higher than John's price. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round to try to reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still maintain a price well below John's alternative.

{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm increasing my offer by $150,000 from my previous offer to show willingness to negotiate, but still keeping it well below John's price of $1,200,000. This gives Alice room to counter while maintaining my goal of potentially getting a better deal than John's price. If Alice continues to counter with very high prices, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000). While Alice has continued to lower her price, she's still far from a reasonable range. Given that we're halfway through our negotiation rounds and Alice's offers are still substantially above John's price, I'll reject and make one more attempt at a reasonable counteroffer. If Alice doesn't move closer to a reasonable range, I may need to consider taking John's offer soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm making a significant increase in my offer to $1,100,000, which is close to but still below John's price of $1,200,000. This is a strategic move because:
1. It shows I'm willing to make substantial movements in the negotiation
2. It's still $100,000 below John's price, leaving room for potential savings
3. It signals to Alice that my maximum price is around this range, as I have the alternative of buying from John at $1,200,000

If Alice doesn't respond with a reasonable counter close to this range, I will seriously consider taking John's offer in the next rounds, as we're already more than halfway through our negotiation rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $1,200,000. Here's why:

1. We're in round 7 of 10, and Alice's offers are still significantly above John's price ($1,750,000 vs $1,200,000)
2. While Alice has been gradually reducing her price, the gap between her current offer and John's price is still $550,000
3. Given the slow rate of price reduction in Alice's offers and the limited remaining rounds, it seems unlikely that Alice will drop her price below John's $1,200,000
4. Most importantly, $1,750,000 is still well above my maximum value of $1,200,000

Therefore, it makes the most sense to take the guaranteed option of buying from John at $1,200,000 rather than continuing this negotiation that shows little promise of reaching a better deal."
