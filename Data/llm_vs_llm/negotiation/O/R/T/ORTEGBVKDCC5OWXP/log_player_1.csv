"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 2,500,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 (John's offer). Since Bob's initial offer is so low, I should continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more reasonable price. I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round, coming down from my initial price to show some flexibility while still maintaining a strong negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll reduce my initial offer but still maintain a strong position that leaves room for further negotiation while staying well above my minimum acceptable price.

{""product_price"": 2,100,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $700,000 is still less than half of John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. While Bob has increased his offer, the increment is relatively small and we're still far from a reasonable price. I'll continue negotiating and make another counteroffer, but if Bob doesn't show more significant movement toward a reasonable price, I might need to consider taking John's offer soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price further to show willingness to negotiate, but still maintain a strong position above John's offer.

{""product_price"": 1,900,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've decided to sell to John for $1,500,000. Here's my reasoning:
1. We've gone through several rounds and Bob's offers are still significantly below John's guaranteed price
2. Bob's incremental increases ($500k → $700k → $850k) suggest he's unlikely to reach or exceed $1.5M
3. We've used 6 of our 10 rounds, and the gap between our positions is still very large
4. The risk of continuing negotiations with Bob isn't worth it when we have a guaranteed $1.5M offer
5. Bob's highest offer ($850k) is still $650k below John's offer, which is too large a difference to ignore

Therefore, it's most prudent to take the guaranteed $1.5M from John rather than continue negotiations that show little promise of exceeding that amount."
