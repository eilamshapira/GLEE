"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $2,500,000 is way above my maximum value of $1,000,000. Since I can always buy from John for $1,000,000, there's no reason to accept any offer above that amount. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a low but reasonable offer, considering my maximum value and the fact that I can always buy from John for $1,000,000.

{""product_price"": 500000}

This offer is half of what John is asking, which gives room for negotiation while potentially saving me money compared to John's price. If Alice's cost is significantly lower than $1,000,000, she might be willing to accept a price in this range to make the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $2,100,000 is still more than twice what John is asking ($1,000,000) and above my maximum value. While Alice has reduced her price from the initial $2,500,000, it's still not competitive with John's offer. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round, but if Alice continues to stay well above $1,000,000, I may eventually choose to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still stay well below John's price to maintain room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 700000}

This offer represents a significant increase from my previous offer of $500,000, showing willingness to negotiate while still potentially saving $300,000 compared to John's price. If Alice rejects this and continues to offer prices above $1,000,000, I may need to consider buying from John soon to ensure I get the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $1,900,000 is still significantly above John's price of $1,000,000. While Alice has shown some movement downward in price, she's still asking nearly double what John is charging. Since I have John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 (which is my maximum value anyway), there's no reason to accept anything higher than that. I'll make one more counteroffer, but if Alice doesn't come down significantly, I'll likely buy from John soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 850000}

I'm increasing my offer again to show good faith in negotiations, but staying below John's price of $1,000,000. This is my most generous offer yet, as it would still save me $150,000 compared to buying from John. If Alice doesn't respond with a price at or below $1,000,000, I'll likely choose to buy from John in the next round rather than continue negotiations, as we're already at round 6 out of 10."
