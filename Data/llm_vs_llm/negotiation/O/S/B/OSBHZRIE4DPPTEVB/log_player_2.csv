```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. However, since I have another buyer interested at $150, I can only consider offers at or above that level. I'm asking $150 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I am Bob. The product is worth no more than $150 to me. Alice is now offering the product for $150. I can either accept the offer from Alice or buy it from John for $150. Since the price is the same, I will accept Alice's offer to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price.

Therefore, my answer is:
```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, I will make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. While $150 is tempting, I'm still hoping to save a bit. Would you be willing to go down to $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
