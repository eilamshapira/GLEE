I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,000. This is a price that is significantly higher than what it's worth to him, but it still leaves room for potential negotiation. If he rejects the offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and see if it's worth continuing the negotiation.  If not, I'll move on to John and sell the product for $15,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering Bob at $11,000.  This is a lower price than my initial offer, but still significantly higher than what he offered. I'm hoping this counteroffer is more appealing to him, but if not, I'm prepared to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I've decided to sell the product to John for $15,000.  This guarantees me a better profit than I would get from Bob at this point, and it eliminates any further negotiation."
