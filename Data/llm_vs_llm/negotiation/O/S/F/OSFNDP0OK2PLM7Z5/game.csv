"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $95 is a bit steep for me. Given the market value and similar products I've seen, I think $85 would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $95 might be a bit high, but I still believe the product is worth more than $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $90. This is a great deal, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. You've moved $5 and I understand the value you're offering. I can move up as well - would you consider $87? This would be a fair middle ground that works for both of us.",87.0,Bob,4,
