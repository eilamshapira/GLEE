Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $95 is a bit steep for me. Given the market value and similar products I've seen, I think $85 would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $85 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($80), but still lower than my initial offer, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $95 might be a bit high, but I still believe the product is worth more than $85.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. You've moved $5 and I understand the value you're offering. I can move up as well - would you consider $87? This would be a fair middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer of $87 is getting closer to my target price, and it's higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($80). Considering that Bob has moved up from his initial counteroffer of $85, I'll choose to accept his offer of $87, as it's a reasonable compromise.
