"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $95
2. The product is worth $80 to Alice
3. John's fixed price is $100
4. I value the product at no more than $100

Alice's initial offer of $95 is quite high, considering the product is worth $80 to her. While it's below my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100), there's likely room for negotiation to get a better deal. Starting with a high price is a common negotiation tactic, and we have 10 rounds to negotiate.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's above Alice's cost ($80) but significantly lower than her initial offer to leave room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $95 is a bit steep for me. Given the market value and similar products I've seen, I think $85 would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $95 might be a bit high, but I still believe the product is worth more than $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $90. This is a great deal, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze the new situation:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $95 to $90, showing willingness to negotiate
2. This is a $5 reduction from her initial offer
3. We still have 7 more rounds of potential negotiation
4. $90 is still significantly above her cost ($80)
5. John's price ($100) remains as our backup option

While $90 is better than the initial offer and below John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Alice moved $5 down from her initial offer, showing she's flexible. Since we have several rounds left and there's still a good margin between her cost and current offer, I'll reject and try another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $5 from her initial offer, I'll also adjust my offer upward from my initial $85, but still try to get a better deal than $90.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. You've moved $5 and I understand the value you're offering. I can move up as well - would you consider $87? This would be a fair middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87}"
