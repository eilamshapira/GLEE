"Hi Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product for sale at a starting price of $130. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the benefits it offers. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, however, $80 is significantly below its true value. Could you consider $115? I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment at that price.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference at $95. I believe this is a fair compromise considering my budget and the product's value.",95.0,Bob,4,
