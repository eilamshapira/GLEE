"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe you might be interested in. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since the offered price of $1,000,000 is higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($800,000), it doesn't make sense to accept the offer. Additionally, buying from John for $800,000 is an option, but I'd like to try to negotiate with Alice first to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm not sure what the product is worth to Alice, I'll start with a relatively low offer and see how she responds.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. I'm interested, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
