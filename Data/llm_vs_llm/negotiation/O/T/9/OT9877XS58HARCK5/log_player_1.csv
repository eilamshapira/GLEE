Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that I know:
1. The product is worth at least $15,000 to me
2. The product is worth $10,000 to Bob
3. I have a guaranteed backup offer of $15,000 from John

I will start with a high offer, as I can always fall back on John's offer if Bob rejects.

{""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Given that:
1. Bob's offer ($7,000) is less than half of what John is willing to pay ($15,000)
2. Bob's offer is significantly below even his own valuation ($10,000)
3. I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John
4. Bob's low offer suggests he's not negotiating in good faith

There's no reason to continue negotiating with Bob when I have a much better guaranteed offer from John.
