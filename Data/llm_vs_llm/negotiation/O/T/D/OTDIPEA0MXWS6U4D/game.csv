"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but the lowest I can go is $250. This product offers great value, and I believe it's worth considering at this price.",250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $250 is still too high for me. How about we settle at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're still a bit apart on the price. I'm willing to come down to $200, which is the best I can do while still valuing the product appropriately. Let me know if this works for you.",200.0,Alice,5,

"Thanks for your flexibility, Alice, but I still can't go that high. How about we meet in the middle at $80?",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, $80 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to lower my price to $180, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",180.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $180 is still beyond my budget. How about I offer $70?",70.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're having trouble meeting in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $160, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",160.0,Alice,9,
