"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it for $150. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Okay, I need to make a decision.

*   **The product is worth $80 to me.**
*   **Alice is asking $150.** This is way too high.
*   **I can buy from John for $80.** This is the maximum I'm willing to pay.

Given these factors, I should go for the best possible deal.

Therefore, my answer is: {""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
