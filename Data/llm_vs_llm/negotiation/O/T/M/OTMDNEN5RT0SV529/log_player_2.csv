"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm confident it can bring significant benefits to your operations.  I'm offering it to you for $950000.  This is a fair price considering its potential, but I'm willing to negotiate.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $950,000 is below my maximum budget of $1,200,000, and I don't know if I can get a better deal from Alice through negotiation, I will accept Alice's offer to save money compared to buying from John.
