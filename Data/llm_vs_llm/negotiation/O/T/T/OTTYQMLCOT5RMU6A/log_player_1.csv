"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $13,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $13500 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $10,000 is too low considering the product's value and knowing it's worth $15,000 to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,000 is too low for this product's value. I can come down from my initial offer to $12,500, which is a significant reduction and represents good value given the product's quality and worth."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, I'm still aiming for something lower. Would you consider $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $11,000. While it's lower than my initial target, it's still a good profit margin above my minimum price of $8,000, and we're reaching a fair middle ground in the negotiation."
