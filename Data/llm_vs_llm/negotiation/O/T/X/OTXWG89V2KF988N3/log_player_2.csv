"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer based on the information provided.

Alice is offering the product for $18,000, which is more than the $12,000 limit that I value the product at. Additionally, I have the option to buy from John for exactly $12,000.

Since Alice's offer ($18,000) exceeds both my maximum valuation and John's alternative price, the rational decision is to reject Alice and purchase from John.
