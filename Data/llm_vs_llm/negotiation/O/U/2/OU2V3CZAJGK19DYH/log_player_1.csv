"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

{""product_price"": 2250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll reject Bob's offer since it's below even the minimum value I'm willing to accept ($1,500,000), and importantly, it's lower than John's guaranteed offer. However, I'll continue negotiating with Bob for now since we still have several rounds left.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still maintain a price above John's guaranteed $1,500,000.

{""product_price"": 1900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. Since I can definitely get $1,500,000 from John, and Bob's offers are still significantly below that, I'll choose to sell to John now rather than continue negotiating for potentially diminishing offers.
