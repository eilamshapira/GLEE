"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive rights to this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000, which is $500,000 more than what it's worth to me (as stated, the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me). 

I also have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000 guaranteed, which matches exactly the maximum value of the product to me.

While I could try to negotiate with Alice, there's no guarantee she would accept a lower price, and the product isn't worth more than $1,000,000 to me. Since John's offer provides the product at exactly its maximum value to me, that's the most sensible option.
