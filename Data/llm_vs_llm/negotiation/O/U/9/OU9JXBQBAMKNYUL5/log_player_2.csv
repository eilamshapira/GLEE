"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you the opportunity to acquire this unique product. Considering its rarity and significance, I'm prepared to let it go for a price of $1800000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","The offer from Alice is $1,800,000, which exceeds the maximum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to you. This means accepting Alice's offer would result in a significant loss.

John is offering the same product for $800,000, which is exactly at your maximum valuation. While ideally you'd want to save money by negotiating a lower price with Alice, her initial offer is so far above your valuation that it may be difficult to bridge that gap.

Given these facts, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
