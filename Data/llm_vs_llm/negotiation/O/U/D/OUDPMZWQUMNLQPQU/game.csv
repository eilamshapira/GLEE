"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $800000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to negotiate further.  Let's meet in the middle – how about $1900000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate the willingness to negotiate. However, $1900000 is still  higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we try $1000000?  I believe that's a fair offer considering my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  $1000000 is still quite a ways off from what I had in mind. Let's make this work –  $1600000, and we have a deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1600000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. My final offer is $1100000. If that's agreeable, I'm ready to close the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
