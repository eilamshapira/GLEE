"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $150
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John for $100

Since:
- The product is worth no more than $100 to me (Bob)
- John is offering the product for $100
- Alice is offering the product for $150 (which is above my maximum value)

The logical choice is to buy from John at $100. This will save me $50 compared to Alice's offer and matches my maximum valuation of the product.
