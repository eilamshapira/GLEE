"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $20,000, I should decline her offer. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $8,000, which is the maximum value I place on the product.
