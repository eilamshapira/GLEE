"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is the maximum I'm willing to pay. There's no room for negotiation upwards. By rejecting and proposing a counteroffer, I can try to get a better price.  Worst-case scenario, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer allows room for negotiation and helps gauge Alice's bottom line.  It's unlikely she'll accept immediately, but it opens the door for a potentially much better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice reducing her price significantly suggests flexibility. While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, there's still potential to negotiate a better price. I'll continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer to show willingness to move, but in smaller increments to test her response. It splits the difference between my last offer and her current one."
