Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by offering the product to Bob at a higher price than my minimum value, hoping to get a good profit while leaving some room for potential negotiation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","I notice that Bob has offered exactly $80, which is the minimum value the product is worth to me and also the exact price John is willing to pay. Since I wouldn't gain any additional profit by accepting Bob's offer compared to selling to John, and Bob's initial rejection of my higher price suggests he may not be willing to pay much more, I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a more modest counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a price point that's acceptable to him while still giving me some profit above my minimum.
