"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $120 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I should let you know that another seller, John, is offering the same product for $80. I'm prepared to buy from you at $65 which would save me some money while giving you a better deal than if I walked away. Let me know if that works for you.",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your offer, $65 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a great price for you and allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for being willing to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $90, but I still can't accept that price. As I mentioned, John is offering the same product for $80, and that's really the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, to save us both the hassle of further negotiation, I can offer you $75. This gives you a quick sale and saves me a bit compared to John's offer. Does that work for you?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to sell it to you for that amount.",85.0,Alice,5,
