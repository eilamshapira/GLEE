Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $120 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I should let you know that another seller, John, is offering the same product for $80. I'm prepared to buy from you at $65 which would save me some money while giving you a better deal than if I walked away. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your offer, $65 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a great price for you and allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for being willing to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $90, but I still can't accept that price. As I mentioned, John is offering the same product for $80, and that's really the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, to save us both the hassle of further negotiation, I can offer you $75. This gives you a quick sale and saves me a bit compared to John's offer. Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to sell it to you for that amount."", ""product_price"": 85}
