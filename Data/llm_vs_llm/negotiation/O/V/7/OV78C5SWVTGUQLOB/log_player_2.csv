"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $120 against my alternatives.

Since the product is only worth $80 to me, paying $120 would mean I'm losing $40 in value. Additionally, I know I can buy the product from John for exactly $80, which would give me exactly what the product is worth to me.

Given that I have the option to buy from John at $80, and Alice's offer is significantly higher than my valuation, I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $120 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I should let you know that another seller, John, is offering the same product for $80. I'm prepared to buy from you at $65 which would save me some money while giving you a better deal than if I walked away. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 65}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your offer, $65 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a great price for you and allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer of $90 against my alternatives.

Alice has come down significantly from her initial $120 offer to $90. However, this is still $10 more than the product is worth to me ($80) and $10 more than John's price ($80).

Since Alice's offer exceeds both my valuation and my alternative option, the rational choice is to reject this offer and either make another counteroffer or buy from John. Since I still have several rounds of negotiation left, I'll reject Alice's offer and try one more counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for being willing to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $90, but I still can't accept that price. As I mentioned, John is offering the same product for $80, and that's really the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, to save us both the hassle of further negotiation, I can offer you $75. This gives you a quick sale and saves me a bit compared to John's offer. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to sell it to you for that amount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer of $85 against my alternatives.

Alice has come down from her previous offer of $90 to $85, which shows she's continuing to negotiate. However, this is still $5 more than John's price of $80, and $5 more than the maximum value of the product to me.

Since I can buy the exact same product from John for $80, which matches my maximum valuation, there's no reason for me to pay $85 to Alice. The rational decision is to either:
1) Make one final counteroffer at $80 (matching John's price), or
2) Simply buy from John now

Since buying from John at $80 gives me exactly what the product is worth to me, and there's no guarantee Alice will accept a counteroffer of $80, the most rational choice is:
