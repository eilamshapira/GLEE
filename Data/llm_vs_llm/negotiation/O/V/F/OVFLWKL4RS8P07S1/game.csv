"Hi Alice! Thanks for the offer, but $180 is quite a bit above my budget. I can offer you $90 for the product. Let me know if we can work something out!",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob! I appreciate your offer, but $90 is significantly lower than I can accept. How about I offer you the product for $150? I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value. Let me know your thoughts!",150.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the revised offer, Alice. However, $150 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Could we meet closer to my budget? How about $100? Let me know if we can make it work.",100.0,Bob,4,
