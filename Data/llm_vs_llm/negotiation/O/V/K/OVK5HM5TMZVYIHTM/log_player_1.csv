"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to buy the product for $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum threshold of $100, and I have the option to sell to John for $100, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I also don't want to give up on the potential to earn more than $100, so I won't sell to John just yet. Instead, I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least a bit closer to my original price. How about we settle at $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to buy the product for $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","This is an interesting turn of events. Bob's offer of $100 is exactly the same as what John is willing to pay, and it's also my minimum threshold. Since I won't be able to get a better offer from John, and Bob's offer is already at my minimum acceptable price, I might as well accept Bob's offer and close the deal.
