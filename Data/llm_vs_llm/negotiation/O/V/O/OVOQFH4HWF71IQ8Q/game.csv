"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $150. This is a fair price considering its features and value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know similar products are available in the market for lower prices. I can offer you $105 for it. This would be a fair price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept $105 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I have other potential buyers willing to pay more. However, I'm willing to work with you and can reduce my initial price. I can offer you the product for $135. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents good value given the product's quality.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $135 is still more than I can justify spending. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $120. However, I'd like to work with you and can increase my offer to $110. This would give you a quick sale, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
