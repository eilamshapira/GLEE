"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $150. This is a fair price considering its features and value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know similar products are available in the market for lower prices. I can offer you $105 for it. This would be a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $105 is below what I can get from John ($120), so it's not acceptable. However, there might be room for negotiation to reach a price that's beneficial for both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept $105 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I have other potential buyers willing to pay more. However, I'm willing to work with you and can reduce my initial price. I can offer you the product for $135. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents good value given the product's quality."", ""product_price"": 135}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $135 is still more than I can justify spending. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $120. However, I'd like to work with you and can increase my offer to $110. This would give you a quick sale, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob has revealed that he knows the market price is $120 and is still offering below that, and since he's only increased his offer by $5 (from $105 to $110), it seems unlikely that we'll reach a price above $120. Given that John is willing to pay $120, which is better than Bob's current offer, it's most profitable to sell to John now rather than continue negotiating with Bob."
