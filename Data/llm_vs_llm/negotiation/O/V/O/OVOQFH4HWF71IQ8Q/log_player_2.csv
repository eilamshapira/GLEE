"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $150. This is a fair price considering its features and value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer of $150 is higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120), it wouldn't make sense to accept it. Given that John is offering $120, which is my maximum value, I could buy from him. However, I might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice since the product is worth $120 to her.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's below John's price but still reasonable for Alice, considering the product is worth $120 to her.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know similar products are available in the market for lower prices. I can offer you $105 for it. This would be a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept $105 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I have other potential buyers willing to pay more. However, I'm willing to work with you and can reduce my initial price. I can offer you the product for $135. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents good value given the product's quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's offer of $135 is still above both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120). Since Alice only reduced the price by $15 from her initial offer, she might still be willing to negotiate further down. However, her price is still significantly above John's price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer, slightly increasing my previous offer but still keeping it below John's price to leave room for negotiation while making it more attractive for Alice.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $135 is still more than I can justify spending. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $120. However, I'd like to work with you and can increase my offer to $110. This would give you a quick sale, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}"
