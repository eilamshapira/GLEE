"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. His offer of $600,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000, which I can get from John. I should continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
