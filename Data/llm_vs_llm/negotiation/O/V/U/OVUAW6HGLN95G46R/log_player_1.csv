"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, considering Bob's offer of $85, my options are clear. I'll analyze them:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85:** This gives me a profit of $85 - $80 = $5.
*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send Bob a counteroffer:** This is risky. I might get a better offer, or Bob might walk away. I also have fewer rounds to negotiate with.
*   **(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80:** This gives me a profit of $80 - $80 = $0.

Since I can make a profit of $5 by selling to Bob, I should accept his offer.
