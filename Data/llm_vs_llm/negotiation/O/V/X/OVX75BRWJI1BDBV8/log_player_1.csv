(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Given that Bob has offered $120, which is significantly better than John's $100, but I believe there's still room for negotiation since the product is worth $150 to Bob, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
