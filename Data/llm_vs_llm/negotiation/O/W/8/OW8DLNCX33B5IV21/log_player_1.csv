"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer as a backup, I'll start with a high initial offer to test Bob's willingness to pay and leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Given that Bob's offer of $550,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000, and even below John's guaranteed offer, I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's initial offer was quite low at $550,000, I'll reduce my initial asking price but still maintain a price well above my minimum value to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $650,000 is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000. Since Bob has only increased his offer by $100,000 from his previous offer, showing limited movement toward a reasonable price, and we already have a guaranteed better option with John, I'll choose to sell to John.
