"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to make a decision here. Alice is offering to sell the product for $2,000,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000. Even if I try to negotiate with Alice, there's a very large gap to bridge.

In this case, since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value of $800,000, and Alice's starting price is so high, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to make a counteroffer first.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still gives some room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": $550,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has only slightly reduced her initial offer from $2,000,000 to $1,750,000, which is still more than double my maximum value of $800,000. The gap between our positions remains very large, and Alice doesn't seem to be moving significantly toward my price range.

Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value of $800,000, and we have limited rounds for negotiation, it's more efficient to reject Alice's offer again and try another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer somewhat to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeping it well below my maximum value.

{""product_price"": $650,000}"
