"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $120. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth $80 to me (maximum I'm willing to pay)
2. Alice is offering it for $120
3. John is willing to sell it for $80
4. My goal is to save money while getting the product

Since Alice's offer ($120) is higher than both:
- The maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($80)
- John's alternative offer ($80)

The logical choice is to buy from John, as it matches my maximum valuation and saves me $40 compared to Alice's offer.
