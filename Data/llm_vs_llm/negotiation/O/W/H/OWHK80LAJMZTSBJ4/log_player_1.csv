Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14000 is a bit high. I'm willing to purchase it for $7000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I believe the product is worth more to Bob, and I'm willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you think $14,000 is a bit high, but I'm afraid $7,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and find a middle ground. Considering the product's value, I'd like to propose a price that's closer to its worth."", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $13000 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to offer $10000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Although $10,000 is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, I still believe the product is worth more to Bob, and I'm willing to try to get a better deal. Since Bob is increasing his offer, it shows he's interested, and I think I can get a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price to $10,000.

I'll make another counteroffer. We're very close to a price that I think is fair, but I believe I can still get a bit more. Bob's willingness to increase his offer to $11,000 shows that he's really interested in the product, and I think he might be willing to go a bit higher. I'll try to split the difference again and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your increased offer, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress.
