Send your offer to Bob.","{
    ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $11,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth and features. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"",

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but based on my assessment, I'd be comfortable proceeding at $9000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. While $9,000 is above my minimum threshold, there's still room for negotiation given the product's true value to Bob. I'll continue negotiating to try to achieve a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{
    ""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is too low considering the product's quality and market value. I can come down from my initial price to $10,500, which I believe is a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product. Would you consider this revised offer?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Given my current alternative and budget constraints, my best offer remains at $10000. I really value this opportunity to work with you and hope you'll agree to this firm offer so we can close the deal efficiently. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $10,000. This is a reasonable price that provides a good profit margin above my minimum threshold of $8,000. While it's below the product's full value to Bob ($12,000), continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether, and $10,000 is significantly better than my fallback option with John at $8,000."
