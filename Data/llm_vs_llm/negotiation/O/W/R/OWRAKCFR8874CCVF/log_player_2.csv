"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Explanation (not part of response): $25,000 is way above my maximum value of $10,000, and it's also much higher than John's price of $10,000. It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations don't work out, I can always buy from John later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 8000}

Explanation (not part of message): I'm offering $8,000 which is below John's price of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate upward if needed while still potentially saving money compared to buying from John. It's also a reasonable starting point that shows I'm serious but looking for a better deal than John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $23,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $23,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Explanation (not part of response): Alice's new offer of $23,000 is still more than twice the price I'm willing to pay ($10,000) and significantly higher than John's price. The small reduction from $25,000 to $23,000 suggests Alice might be willing to negotiate further, but we're still very far apart. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 8500}

Explanation (not part of message): I'm slightly increasing my previous offer from $8,000 to $8,500 to show willingness to negotiate, but still staying well below John's price of $10,000. This gives me room to continue negotiating while demonstrating that I'm making reasonable moves upward. If Alice doesn't come down significantly in the next round, I might consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $21,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $21,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Explanation (not part of response): After multiple rounds of negotiation, Alice is still asking for $21,000, which is more than twice John's price of $10,000. While Alice has shown some willingness to reduce the price (from $25,000 to $21,000), the rate of reduction is too slow, and we're still far above my maximum value of $10,000. Since John's offer is at my maximum acceptable price, and Alice seems unlikely to match or beat it in the remaining rounds, it's best to end the negotiation and buy from John."
