"Thanks for your interest, Bob. $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $130.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer, so how about $95? I think that's a fair price for the product.",95.0,Bob,4,
