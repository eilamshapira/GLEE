"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think you'll love it! How about you buy it for $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, let's evaluate. Bob's offering $90. That's less than my minimum ($120) and less than John's offer ($120). However, if I reject and counter, I could potentially get a better price from Bob, but I risk losing the deal altogether. I also have a limited number of rounds.

Since I want to maximize my profit and I know John is ready to pay $120, I'll counter Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $130."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer, so how about $95? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, let's analyze. Bob is now offering $95. This is still less than what I need ($120) and less than what John is offering. I'm also getting further into the negotiation.

At this point, I need to seriously consider selling to John to guarantee a profit. I'm not getting anywhere with Bob, and each round I spend with him is an opportunity cost.
