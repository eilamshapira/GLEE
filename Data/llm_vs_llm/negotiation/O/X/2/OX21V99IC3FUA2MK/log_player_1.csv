Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my options here. The product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and Bob values it at $1,000,000. If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell it to John for $1,500,000.

Since the product is worth no less than $1,500,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price, there's no reason for me to sell to Bob for less. Bob won't accept any price above $1,000,000 since that exceeds his valuation of the product.

In this situation, my best option is to make an offer to Bob that at least matches my minimum acceptable price.
