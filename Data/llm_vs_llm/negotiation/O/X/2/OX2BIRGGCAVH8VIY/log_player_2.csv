"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product for $1500000. I believe it is a great investment for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($1,000,000) and John's alternative offer ($1,000,000). It would not make sense to accept this offer. Since John's price matches my maximum valuation, I could buy from him, but it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I know the product is valuable, but I can actually get the same product from another seller for $1,000,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $800,000? This would give us both a fair deal and save me the trouble of going to another seller."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
