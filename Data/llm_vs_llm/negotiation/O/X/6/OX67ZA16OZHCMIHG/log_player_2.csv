"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000.  It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I believe this price reflects its worth and is fair to both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is less than the $1,200,000 maximum value to me. It's also $200,000 less than John's price.

This is a good deal since the offer is well below my maximum valuation, and significantly better than the alternative option of buying from John.
