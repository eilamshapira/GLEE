"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision that maximizes my benefit as Bob.

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and:
- Alice is offering to sell it for $1,000,000
- John is willing to sell it for $800,000

If I accept Alice's offer, I would be paying $1,000,000 for something worth at most $800,000 to me, which would be a loss of at least $200,000.

If I buy from John, I would pay exactly $800,000, which is the maximum value the product has to me.

The rational choice is:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
