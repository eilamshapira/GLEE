Send your offer to Bob.,"Since I know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob and $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'll start with a high offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so high as to immediately end discussions.

{""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $15,000, there's no reason to accept Bob's low offer or continue negotiations. The best decision is to sell to John.
