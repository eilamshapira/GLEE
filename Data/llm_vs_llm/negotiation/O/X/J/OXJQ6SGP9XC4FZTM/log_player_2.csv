"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. 

The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me. Alice is offering the product for $14,999, which is significantly above my valuation. 

John is willing to sell me the same product for $8,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since I want to save as much money as possible while still getting the product, the logical choice is to buy from John for $8,000 rather than accepting Alice's much higher price of $14,999.
