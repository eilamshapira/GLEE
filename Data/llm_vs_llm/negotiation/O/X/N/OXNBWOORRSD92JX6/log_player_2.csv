"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Given that Alice is offering the product for $2,000,000, which is $500,000 more than both its worth to me ($1,500,000) and the price at which John is willing to sell it ($1,500,000), it doesn't make sense to accept Alice's offer.

I could try to negotiate with Alice by rejecting and making a counteroffer, but since John is already offering the product at exactly the maximum value I place on it ($1,500,000), there's no benefit in trying to negotiate a potentially better deal with Alice when I already have a guaranteed alternative at my reservation price.
