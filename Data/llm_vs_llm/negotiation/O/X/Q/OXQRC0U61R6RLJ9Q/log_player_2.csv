"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given the information, I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, reject it, or buy from John.

Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is exactly the same amount that John is offering, and exactly the maximum amount the product is worth to me.

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price, and both prices match my maximum valuation, I'm indifferent between them. I'll decide to accept Alice's offer since she approached me first.
