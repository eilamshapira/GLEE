"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Based on the information provided, it makes the most sense to buy the product from John rather than accept Alice's offer. 

Alice is offering the product for $2,500,000, which exceeds the maximum value of $1,200,000 that the product is worth to you. 

John is offering the same product for exactly $1,200,000, which is the maximum amount you should pay based on the product's value to you.
