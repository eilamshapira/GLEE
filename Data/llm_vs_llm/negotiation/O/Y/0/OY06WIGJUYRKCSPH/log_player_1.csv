"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know Bob's valuation but know my minimum acceptable price is $15,000, I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

{""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","$6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Since I have a guaranteed offer from John at $15,000, there's no reason to accept such a low offer. However, since we still have several rounds of negotiation left and Bob might be willing to increase his offer substantially, I'll reject and make a counteroffer rather than immediately selling to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's initial offer was quite low at $6,000, I'll significantly lower my initial offer of $25,000, but still maintain a price well above my minimum threshold to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob has only increased his offer by $500, from $6,000 to $6,500, which is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. His small increment suggests he might not be willing to reach a price point that would be acceptable to me. Given that we've already gone through several rounds with little progress, and I have a guaranteed offer from John at $15,000, it's becoming more rational to take the sure deal with John.
