"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that Alice's offer is $15,000, which is significantly higher than the $8,000 the product is worth to me, and also higher than John's price of $8,000, I should not accept this offer.

I have two remaining options: make a counteroffer to Alice or buy from John. Since I have 10 rounds available for negotiation, it makes sense to try negotiating with Alice first to see if I can get a better price than John's $8,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but still gives me room to negotiate upward if needed.

{""product_price"": $5,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price from $15,000 to $13,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still significantly higher than the product's worth to me ($8,000) and higher than John's price ($8,000).

Since Alice is showing flexibility and we still have plenty of rounds left for negotiation, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating to try getting a better price than John's.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still aim for a price below John's $8,000.

{""product_price"": $6,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has only reduced her price by $500 (from $13,000 to $12,500), which is still much higher than both the product's worth to me and John's price of $8,000. 

At this point, Alice seems to be making small concessions, but the price is still far above an acceptable range. I'll continue negotiating since we still have rounds available.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer a bit more to show continued willingness to negotiate, but I need to stay below John's price of $8,000 to make this worthwhile.

{""product_price"": $7,200}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice is still offering $12,000, which is $4,000 more than John's price of $8,000. She's making very small reductions in her offers ($500 each time), which suggests she might not come down to a price below $8,000 within our remaining negotiation rounds.

Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and John is offering exactly that price, it's becoming more reasonable to take John's offer rather than continue this negotiation that doesn't seem to be moving quickly toward an acceptable price.
