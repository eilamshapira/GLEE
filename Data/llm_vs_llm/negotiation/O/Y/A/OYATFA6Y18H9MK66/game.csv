"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $200 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious consideration of your interest. Let's try to find a middle ground.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $90. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to increase your offer. However, I need to be clear that I have another buyer interested in the product for $150. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at a price that's closer to its value. I'll slightly reduce my previous offer, but I expect a more significant increase from you.",155.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your honesty about the other buyer. However, I'm not willing to pay $155. Considering the other option I have from John for $120, I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $110. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",110.0,Bob,8,
