"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let's start the negotiation."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $200 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $80 is too low for me. I'm aiming to get a better price, and selling to John for $150 is still an option if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious consideration of your interest. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 175}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $90. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Although Bob increased his offer, $90 is still far from my target price. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to get a better deal. Selling to John for $150 is still a viable option if the negotiation doesn't improve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $90. However, I still believe the product's value is higher. I'm trying to be flexible, so I'll make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. Let's see if we can meet closer to the middle."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. However, $160 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $100. I think this is a reasonable price, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Although Bob has increased his offer again, $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Since I have a guaranteed offer of $150 from John, I'm not willing to go below that. I'll try to meet Bob closer to the $150 mark, but if he's not willing to meet me there, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to increase your offer. However, I need to be clear that I have another buyer interested in the product for $150. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at a price that's closer to its value. I'll slightly reduce my previous offer, but I expect a more significant increase from you."", ""product_price"": 155}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your honesty about the other buyer. However, I'm not willing to pay $155. Considering the other option I have from John for $120, I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $110. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob's highest offer is $110, which is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I have a guaranteed offer of $150 from John, I've decided to sell the product to John. This ensures I get a price that meets my requirements, and I don't have to risk further negotiation that may not yield a better result."
