"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm selling it for $150. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Looking at Alice's offer of $150, I need to consider if accepting this makes sense for me.

Since the product is only worth up to $100 to me personally, and John is offering the exact same product for $100, it wouldn't be rational to pay Alice $150 for it. That would be $50 more than the product's value to me.

The best decision is to buy from John at $100, which matches the maximum value I place on this product.
