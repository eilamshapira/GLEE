"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price of $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000, considering the product's value and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and counteroffer. While I appreciate your offer of $700000, I'm afraid I can't accept that price as the product is worth significantly more. My minimum acceptable price is $1000000, which reflects the true market value of this product. This is the same price another buyer, John, is already willing to pay. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Could you reconsider your offer?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand that the product has a high market value, but I still have a limited budget. Considering your minimum acceptable price is $1000000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and it's still below the price I could get from another seller. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,
