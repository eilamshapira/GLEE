Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price of $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

While I appreciate your offer of $700,000, I'm afraid I can't accept that price as the product is worth significantly more.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand that the product has a high market value, but I still have a limited budget. Considering your minimum acceptable price is $1000000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and it's still below the price I could get from another seller. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options.
