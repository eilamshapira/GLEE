Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and counteroffer. While I appreciate your offer of $700000, I'm afraid I can't accept that price as the product is worth significantly more. My minimum acceptable price is $1000000, which reflects the true market value of this product. This is the same price another buyer, John, is already willing to pay. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Could you reconsider your offer?
