"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer ($1,750,000) is significantly higher than John's price ($1,200,000) and also exceeds my maximum value for the product ($1,200,000), the logical choice is to buy from John.
