"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth at least $10,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at $10,000, I'll start with a relatively high price to test Bob's willingness to pay.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer ($8,000) is below my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) and even below John's guaranteed offer ($10,000), it would not be rational to accept it.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a new counteroffer in the next round, but I'll lower my initial price to try to find a middle ground while still staying above my minimum threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price significantly from my initial offer but still keep it well above my minimum threshold to leave room for negotiation while ensuring profitability.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and below John's guaranteed offer of $10,000. While Bob has increased his offer, it's still not enough to match my guaranteed alternative.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make another counteroffer in the next round, but I'll lower my price further to show willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price above my minimum threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price further but keep it above my minimum threshold. Since Bob's last offer was $9,000, I'll try to meet closer to the middle while still ensuring I get more than John's offer.
