Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll analyze this situation strategically. Since I know I have a guaranteed backup offer of $800,000 from John, that's my floor price. Bob's value for the product is unknown, but since this appears to be a high-value item, there's potential for significant upside if Bob values it highly. I should set a price that's notably higher than my floor price to maximize my potential profit while still being potentially acceptable to a serious buyer.
