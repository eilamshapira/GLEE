"Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for $8,000, Alice's offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation and my alternative option.
