"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. However, I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I can come down to $14000, which is the lowest I'm comfortable with at this point.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14000 is still a bit high for me. How about $12500?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,
