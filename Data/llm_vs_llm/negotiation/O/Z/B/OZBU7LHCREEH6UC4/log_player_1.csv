"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its worth."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us while maximizing my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. However, I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I can come down to $14,000, which is the lowest I'm comfortable with at this point."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14000 is still a bit high for me. How about $12500?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $12,500 is higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($12,000) and higher than what John is offering ($12,000), so it's a good deal for me. Accepting this offer allows me to earn more than my baseline, making it a favorable outcome."
