"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115. It's a great value, especially considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

- The product is worth up to $120 to me
- Alice is offering it for $115
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $120

Since Alice's offer ($115) is $5 less than John's price ($120), and still within my maximum value threshold, it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer.
