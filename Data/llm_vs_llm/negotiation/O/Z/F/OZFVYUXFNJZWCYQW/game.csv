"Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a price of $18000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $18000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $5000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective, but $5000 is significantly below its true value. Could you consider a price closer to $15000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $15000 is still outside my budget.  I could go up to $6500.  That's a significant jump from my last offer, showing I'm serious about purchasing.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, the $6500 offer is still quite low considering what this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $12000? This feels like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the effort to find a compromise.  While $12000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $7500? This offer reflects my strong interest while respecting my budget.",7500.0,Bob,6,
