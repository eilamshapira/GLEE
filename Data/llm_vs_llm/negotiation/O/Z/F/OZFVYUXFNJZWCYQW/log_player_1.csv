Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $18000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $5000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $15000 is still outside my budget.  I could go up to $6500.  That's a significant jump from my last offer, showing I'm serious about purchasing.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, the $6,500 offer is still quite low considering what this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the effort to find a compromise.  While $12000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $7500? This offer reflects my strong interest while respecting my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

While Bob is showing some interest, his offers are increasing too slowly. It's unlikely he'll reach a price I find acceptable before my patience (or profit margin) runs out. Accepting John's offer for $10,000 is the safest option at this point."
