"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are looking to save as much money as possible.  Since you can buy the product from John for the same price Alice is offering, rejecting Alice's offer doesn't change your cost. This allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice in the future."
