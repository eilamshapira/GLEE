"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you engaging. $10000 is a bit lower than I can go right now. How about we meet in the middle at $12500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for considering my offer, Alice. I understand your position, but $12500 is still a stretch for me. Could you go down to $11000? I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Okay, Bob, I hear you. $11000 is getting closer. My absolute lowest is $12000. I really think it's worth it, and I'm already taking a hit at that price. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
