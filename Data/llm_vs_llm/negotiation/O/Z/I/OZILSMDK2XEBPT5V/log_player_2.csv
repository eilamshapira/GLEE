"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Based on market research and the product's features, I'm offering it to you for $180. This product has excellent value and durability. I believe this is a fair price considering its quality and performance. Are you interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $100
2. Alice is offering the product for $180
3. John is offering the product for $100
4. The difference between Alice's offer ($180) and my maximum value ($100) means I would be losing $80 by accepting her offer
5. John's price matches my maximum value, which is much better than Alice's offer

Since Alice's price ($180) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's alternative offer ($100), the logical choice is to buy from John.
