Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my options carefully. Since the product is worth at least $150 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at exactly $150, there's no incentive for me to sell to Bob for less than $150.

While the product is only worth $80 to Bob, so he would rationally reject any offer above $80, I still have John as a guaranteed backup buyer at $150.
