"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $3000000 is significantly above my budget. I value your product, but I need to be practical about my spending limits. I can offer $900000, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions. I would appreciate your consideration of this offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $900000, I need to point out that this falls significantly below the actual value of the product. I understand budget concerns, but I also need to consider the product's worth. I'm willing to adjust my initial offer to $2500000, which is already a considerable reduction. This price reflects the quality and unique features of what I'm offering. I should also mention that I have another interested buyer willing to pay $1500000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a fair agreement.",2500000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $2500000 is still well above what I can justify spending. While you mentioned another buyer at $1500000, I need to be transparent that I have other options available at $1200000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I can increase my offer to $1100000, which is very close to my maximum budget. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in working with you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your desire to work together. I understand you have other options at $1200000, but I need to be transparent that my alternative buyer is firm at $1500000. Since that's my guaranteed fallback position, I can't accept anything below that price. However, I'm still willing to work with you rather than the other buyer if we can reach a fair agreement. I can come down to $1900000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial ask. This price still reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
