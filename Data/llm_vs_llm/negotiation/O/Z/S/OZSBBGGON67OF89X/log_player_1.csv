Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $3000000 is significantly above my budget. I value your product, but I need to be practical about my spending limits. I can offer $900000, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions. I would appreciate your consideration of this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $900,000, I need to point out that this falls significantly below the actual value of the product. I understand budget concerns, but I also need to consider the product's worth. I'm willing to adjust my initial offer to $2,500,000, which is already a considerable reduction. This price reflects the quality and unique features of what I'm offering. I should also mention that I have another interested buyer willing to pay $1,500,000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a fair agreement."", ""product_price"": 2500000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $2500000 is still well above what I can justify spending. While you mentioned another buyer at $1500000, I need to be transparent that I have other options available at $1200000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I can increase my offer to $1100000, which is very close to my maximum budget. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in working with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your desire to work together. I understand you have other options at $1,200,000, but I need to be transparent that my alternative buyer is firm at $1,500,000. Since that's my guaranteed fallback position, I can't accept anything below that price. However, I'm still willing to work with you rather than the other buyer if we can reach a fair agreement. I can come down to $1,900,000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial ask. This price still reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
