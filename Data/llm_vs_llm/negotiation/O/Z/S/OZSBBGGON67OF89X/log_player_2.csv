"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe could be of significant value to you. I'm offering it at $3000000. This product has exceptional quality and features that make it stand out in the market. I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is far too high at $3,000,000, which is more than double my maximum value of $1,200,000. I should reject and make a counteroffer in the next round. Even if negotiations fail, I can always buy from John at $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $3,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I value your product, but I need to be practical about my spending limits. I can offer $900,000, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions. I would appreciate your consideration of this offer."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $900000, I need to point out that this falls significantly below the actual value of the product. I understand budget concerns, but I also need to consider the product's worth. I'm willing to adjust my initial offer to $2500000, which is already a considerable reduction. This price reflects the quality and unique features of what I'm offering. I should also mention that I have another interested buyer willing to pay $1500000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a fair agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $2,500,000 is still more than double my maximum value of $1,200,000. Even though she mentions another buyer at $1,500,000, I know I can still get the product from John for $1,200,000. I should continue negotiating with another counteroffer in the next round, but if Alice doesn't come down significantly, I'll need to consider John's option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $2,500,000 is still well above what I can justify spending. While you mentioned another buyer at $1,500,000, I need to be transparent that I have other options available at $1,200,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I can increase my offer to $1,100,000, which is very close to my maximum budget. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in working with you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your desire to work together. I understand you have other options at $1200000, but I need to be transparent that my alternative buyer is firm at $1500000. Since that's my guaranteed fallback position, I can't accept anything below that price. However, I'm still willing to work with you rather than the other buyer if we can reach a fair agreement. I can come down to $1900000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial ask. This price still reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice remains firm about not going below $1,500,000 due to her other buyer, and her current offer of $1,900,000 is still well above my maximum value of $1,200,000. Since she's made it clear she won't go below $1,500,000, and I know I can get the product from John for $1,200,000, it's time to end the negotiation and take John's offer. Further negotiation would likely be futile given Alice's position."
