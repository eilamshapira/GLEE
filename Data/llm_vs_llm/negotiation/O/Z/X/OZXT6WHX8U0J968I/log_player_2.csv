"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I know this product is incredibly valuable to you, and I'm excited about the potential for you to leverage its unique capabilities. I'm offering it to you for $950000. I believe this price fairly reflects its worth to you, while allowing me to continue to grow my business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to analyze the options carefully:

Option 1: Accept Alice's offer of $950,000
Option 2: Reject Alice's offer
Option 3: Buy from John for $1,000,000

The product is worth up to $1,000,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $950,000, which is $50,000 less than what John is offering. My goal is to obtain the product while saving as much money as possible.

If I reject Alice's offer, my only alternative is to buy from John at a higher price. There's no negotiation opportunity mentioned, so this would be a poor decision.
