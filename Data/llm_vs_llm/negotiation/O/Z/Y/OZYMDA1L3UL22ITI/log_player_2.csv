"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

The price offered by Alice ($15,000) is equal to both my maximum value for the product and John's offering price. Since all options lead to the same price, I might as well accept Alice's offer directly. There's no financial advantage in rejecting the offer or buying from John instead."
