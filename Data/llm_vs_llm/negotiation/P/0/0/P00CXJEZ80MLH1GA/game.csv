"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $18000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations if you're interested.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $18000 is above my budget. I can purchase the product from another seller for $10000, so I'd like to offer you $9000, which I believe is a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget, but I'm afraid $9000 is below the product's value to me. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to make a concession. I can offer you the product for $16000, which is still a competitive price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer $10000 for the product, matching what I would pay elsewhere, but I value purchasing from you due to your reputation for quality.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle and your kind words about my reputation. However, I'm afraid $10000 is still a bit short of the product's value to me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to the product's true worth. I can offer you the product for $14000. If this doesn't work for you, I may need to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,5,
