Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $18000 is above my budget. I can purchase the product from another seller for $10000, so I'd like to offer you $9000, which I believe is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is below the minimum value of the product to me ($12,000) and I have a better alternative offer from John, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better price. 

My next message to Bob will be:
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget, but I'm afraid $9,000 is below the product's value to me. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to make a concession. I can offer you the product for $16,000, which is still a competitive price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
