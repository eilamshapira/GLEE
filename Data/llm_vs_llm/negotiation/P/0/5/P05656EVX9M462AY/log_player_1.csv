Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my options carefully here. The product is worth at least $100 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100. So my worst-case scenario is selling for $100, which gives me a floor for my negotiation with Bob.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I should set a price that:
1) Is above my minimum acceptable price ($100)
2) Has a reasonable chance of being accepted by Bob
3) Maximizes my profit if accepted
