"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,200,000
2. John's fixed offer is $1,200,000
3. Alice's first offer is $1,100,000
4. Alice's cost is $800,000, so there's room for negotiation

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is already better than John's price ($1,200,000), but since this is just the first round and Alice's cost is much lower at $800,000, I believe I can negotiate for a better price. It's worth trying to get a lower price through negotiation since I still have 9 more rounds left.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Let me think about a strategic counteroffer:

1. Alice's cost is $800,000
2. Her initial offer was $1,100,000
3. I can propose a price closer to her cost, but not too low to be immediately rejected
4. A reasonable counteroffer would be roughly halfway between her cost and her initial offer

$800,000 + ($1,100,000 - $800,000)/2 = $950,000

This offer:
- Gives Alice a decent profit margin ($150,000)
- Saves me significantly compared to both John's price and Alice's initial offer
- Leaves room for further negotiation if needed

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let's analyze the situation:

1. Alice has lowered her price from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. The reduction of $50,000 from her initial offer suggests she might be open to further negotiation
3. We still have 7 more rounds available
4. Her new offer is still $150,000 better than John's price
5. There's still a significant margin between her cost ($800,000) and current offer ($1,050,000)

While $1,050,000 is a better price, there seems to be room for further negotiation. Given that Alice has shown flexibility and we have several rounds remaining, I'll reject this offer to try for an even better price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Let me make a strategic counteroffer:

1. Alice moved down from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000 (a $50,000 reduction)
2. My previous offer was $950,000, which was rejected
3. I should move up from my previous offer to show willingness to compromise
4. The gap between our last positions was $100,000 ($1,050,000 - $950,000)

I'll split the difference between our last positions, moving up $50,000 from my previous offer:
$950,000 + $50,000 = $1,000,000

This offer:
- Shows I'm willing to move toward her position
- Still gives me a good savings compared to John's price
- Provides Alice with a $200,000 profit margin
- Leaves room for further negotiation if needed
