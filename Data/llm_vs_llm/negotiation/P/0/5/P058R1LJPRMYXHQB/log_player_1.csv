Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to counter with $100. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price. My next offer will be $140.

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, trying to get closer to a price that I'm comfortable with. My next offer will be $125.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I'm really trying to stay within my budget. Could you go down to $115? I think that would be a great deal for both of us.

You have three options:

Since Bob's offer of $115 is lower than John's offer of $120, and I've already come down significantly in price, I think it's best to sell the product to John for $120, which is a better deal for me."
