"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I believe the product could be valuable, the price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I need to be transparent - I have another buyer willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which represents my absolute minimum price point. Given the product's true value, I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price significantly, but I can offer it to you at $1800000, which is still a fair price considering its potential return on investment. Would you consider this revised offer?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for clarifying your position. While another buyer is certainly a factor, $1800000 is still significantly above where I see the value. If you're willing to work with me, I could go up to $1050000.  This offer considers both the potential of the product and the information you've provided about other buyers.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
