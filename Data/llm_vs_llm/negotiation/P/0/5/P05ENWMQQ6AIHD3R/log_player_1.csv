"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,500,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's potential and features. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I believe the product could be valuable, the price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $800,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and since I have John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000, there's no reason to accept a lower amount. However, I believe Bob might be willing to negotiate to a higher price, so I'll continue the negotiation rather than immediately selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I need to be transparent - I have another buyer willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which represents my absolute minimum price point. Given the product's true value, I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price significantly, but I can offer it to you at $1,800,000, which is still a fair price considering its potential return on investment. Would you consider this revised offer?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for clarifying your position. While another buyer is certainly a factor, $1800000 is still significantly above where I see the value. If you're willing to work with me, I could go up to $1050000.  This offer considers both the potential of the product and the information you've provided about other buyers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,050,000. This is a reasonable outcome because:
1. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000
2. It's $50,000 more than John's guaranteed offer
3. Based on Bob's negotiation pattern, it seems this might be close to his maximum willingness to pay
4. Continuing the negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether, and the potential upside of further negotiation may not be worth the risk"
