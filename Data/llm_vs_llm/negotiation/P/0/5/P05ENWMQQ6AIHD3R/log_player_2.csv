Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I need to be transparent - I have another buyer willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which represents my absolute minimum price point. Given the product's true value, I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price significantly, but I can offer it to you at $1800000, which is still a fair price considering its potential return on investment. Would you consider this revised offer?
