"Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to evaluate this offer carefully:

- The product is worth at most $8,000 to me
- Alice's offer is $16,000, which is twice what the product is worth to me
- I can buy the product from John for $8,000, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me

Since Alice's offer is well above my valuation, and there's an alternative option that matches my maximum value, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer or continue negotiating with her.
