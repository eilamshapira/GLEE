"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth at least $10,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at $10,000, I'll start with a higher price to test Bob's willingness to pay.

{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","I will reject Bob's offer of $6,000 as it is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 (which I can get from John). This low offer might indicate that Bob is trying to anchor the negotiation at a low price point.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still keep it substantially above my minimum price of $10,000, showing some flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position.

{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $7,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While he has increased his offer, the increment is small and still far from my reservation price. Since I have a guaranteed $10,000 from John, and Bob's offers so far suggest he might not be willing to go much higher, I'll choose to sell to John rather than continue negotiations that may not be productive.
