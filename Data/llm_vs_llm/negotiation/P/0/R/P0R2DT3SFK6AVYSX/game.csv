"Alice, thank you for your initial offer. My budget is limited, and I'm really interested in the product. How about we settle at $12000? This would make the deal workable for me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you have a limited budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $12000. I'm willing to compromise, but not that low. How about we meet in the middle of my initial offer and your counteroffer?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me. While I value the product, my budget is firmly capped due to alternative options I have at $15000. To make this work for both of us and close the deal quickly, would you accept $14000 as a final offer?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your transparency about your budget and the alternative options you have. I'm willing to make another concession to try to close the deal. Considering your cap is at $15000 due to other options, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14500. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, given the product's value.",14500.0,Alice,5,
