"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your initial offer. My budget is limited, and I'm really interested in the product. How about we settle at $12000? This would make the deal workable for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $12,000 is lower than my initial offer, and I believe the product is worth more. I'm willing to negotiate, but I want to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you have a limited budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $12,000. I'm willing to compromise, but not that low. How about we meet in the middle of my initial offer and your counteroffer?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me. While I value the product, my budget is firmly capped due to alternative options I have at $15000. To make this work for both of us and close the deal quickly, would you accept $14000 as a final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. While $14,000 is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, I still believe I can get a better deal. Since Bob mentioned that his budget is capped due to alternative options at $15,000, I think there's room to negotiate further. I'll try to meet him closer to his cap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your transparency about your budget and the alternative options you have. I'm willing to make another concession to try to close the deal. Considering your cap is at $15,000 due to other options, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,500. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, given the product's value."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
