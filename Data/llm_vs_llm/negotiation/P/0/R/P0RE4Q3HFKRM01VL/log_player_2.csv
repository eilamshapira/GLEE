"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to begin discussions about this unique opportunity. This product offers significant potential returns. To start, I'm offering it to you for $2500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. Alice's offer of $2,500,000 is more than 3 times my maximum value
3. John is offering the exact product at my maximum value ($800,000)

I should definitely not accept Alice's current offer as it's far above my maximum value. While I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, her initial offer is so high that it suggests she might have unrealistic expectations about the price. Since I have the option to buy from John at my maximum acceptable price, and there's a risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice within the 10 rounds, the most rational decision would be to:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

This guarantees I get the product at my maximum acceptable price without the uncertainty of a potentially lengthy negotiation that might not succeed."
