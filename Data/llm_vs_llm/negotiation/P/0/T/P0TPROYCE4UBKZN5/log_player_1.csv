Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation or makes a slightly lower counter-offer more appealing. 
* **Staying Above My Minimum:**  The offer of $130 is significantly higher than Bob's value ($80) but still allows me to make a good profit if he accepts. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** I know John is willing to pay $150, which gives me a strong fallback position. I don't need to go below my minimum price."
