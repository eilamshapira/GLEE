Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1,500,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to make a decision based on the value of the product to me and the offers on the table.

Bob has offered $800,000, which is below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. Since I can sell the product to John for exactly $1,200,000, and this matches my minimum value threshold, I should take the guaranteed sale to John rather than continuing negotiations with Bob.
