"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know would be incredibly valuable for you. I've set the price at $14000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $14,000 is less than John's offer, it's still significantly higher than Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000). There's room for negotiation.  I'll try to get a better price."
