"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I know I can get this product from another seller for $1000000. Given that, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. This would give you a quick sale while saving me some money. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to sell at that price. It's a valuable product, and I believe it's worth more than $900000. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. It's a fair price that would give us both a good deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
