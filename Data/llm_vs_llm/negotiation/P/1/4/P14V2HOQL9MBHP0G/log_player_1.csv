Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I know I can get this product from another seller for $1000000. Given that, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. This would give you a quick sale while saving me some money. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
