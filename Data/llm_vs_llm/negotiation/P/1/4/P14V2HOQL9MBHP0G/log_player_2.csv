"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, so I won't accept Alice's offer of $1,100,000 as it would result in a loss. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer. If we can't reach an agreement below $1,000,000, I can always buy from John at $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I know I can get this product from another seller for $1,000,000. Given that, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. This would give you a quick sale while saving me some money. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to sell at that price. It's a valuable product, and I believe it's worth more than $900000. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. It's a fair price that would give us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $950,000. This is a good deal because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $1,000,000
2. It's $50,000 less than John's price
3. We've reached a fair compromise between our initial positions
4. Further negotiation might risk losing this favorable price"
