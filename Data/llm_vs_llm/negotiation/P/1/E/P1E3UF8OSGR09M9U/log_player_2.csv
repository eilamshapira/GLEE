"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll reject Alice's offer of $950,000 since it's quite high and there's room for negotiation. Alice's cost is $800,000, so there's significant margin for a better price. While John's price of $1,000,000 is a guaranteed option, it's the highest price and should be used only as a last resort.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's $950,000 but still gives her a reasonable profit above her $800,000 cost. I'll offer $850,000, which would give Alice a $50,000 profit while saving me $150,000 compared to her initial offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has reduced her price by $25,000 from her initial offer, showing some willingness to negotiate. However, there's still room for a better deal since her cost is $800,000. I'll reject this offer and try another counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still try to get a better deal than Alice's $925,000. I'll offer $875,000, which would give Alice a $75,000 profit while still saving me $50,000 compared to her latest offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has now reduced her price to $900,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial $950,000 offer. This price gives her a $100,000 profit while saving me $100,000 compared to John's price. Given that we've been negotiating for several rounds and the price movement is getting smaller, this seems like a reasonable deal. I'll accept this offer.
