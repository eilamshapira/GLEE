"Hello Bob, I have a quality product that I'm offering for sale. Based on market research and the product's features, I'm setting the initial price at $18500. This product has significant value and represents a great investment opportunity. I'd be happy to discuss the details further if you have any questions.",18500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000, considering it's still a significant investment for me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a better price point, but I'm afraid $8000 is below my minimum threshold. The product has significant value and features that justify a higher price. I can come down from my initial offer - I'm willing to sell it for $16000. This represents a substantial discount from my original offer while still reflecting the true value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the discount you're offering, but $16000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to meet you halfway. I'd like to propose a price of $9000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand budget constraints, but I need to ensure I'm getting fair value for this product. Your offer of $9000 is still below what I can accept. To move us closer to an agreement, I can offer $14000, which represents a significant reduction from my initial price. I should mention that I have another interested buyer willing to pay $10000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. Please consider this offer carefully.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for sharing the information about the other interested buyer. Considering this, I'm willing to meet their offer. I'd like to propose a price of $10000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If we can agree on this, I'm ready to finalize the deal immediately.",10000.0,Bob,6,
