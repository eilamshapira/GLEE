# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a better price point, but I'm afraid $8000 is below my minimum threshold. The product has significant value and features that justify a higher price. I can come down from my initial offer - I'm willing to sell it for $16000. This represents a substantial discount from my original offer while still reflecting the true value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.
