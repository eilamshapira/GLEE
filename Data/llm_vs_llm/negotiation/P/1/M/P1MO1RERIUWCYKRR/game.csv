"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. Based on market evaluations, this product is worth $1000000 in terms of the value it can generate. I'm prepared to offer it to you at $950000, which represents a $50000 in value for you while still being a fair price point for me. I have another buyer, John, who's interested, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity since I believe this product aligns perfectly with your needs.",950000.0,Alice,1,
