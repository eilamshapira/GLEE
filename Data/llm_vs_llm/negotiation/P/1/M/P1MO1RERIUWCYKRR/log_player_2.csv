"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. Based on market evaluations, this product is worth $1000000 in terms of the value it can generate. I'm prepared to offer it to you at $950000, which represents a $50000 in value for you while still being a fair price point for me. I have another buyer, John, who's interested, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity since I believe this product aligns perfectly with your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully to make the best decision for myself.

Alice is offering the product for $950,000, while I know it's worth at most $1,000,000 to me. I also know that I can buy the same product from John for $1,000,000 if I reject Alice's offer.

By accepting Alice's offer, I would pay $950,000 and save $50,000 compared to buying from John. Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, accepting Alice's offer is the most economical choice.
