"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that I know the product is worth $8,000 to Bob and $12,000 to me, and I have John's guaranteed offer of $12,000, I'll start with a high offer to see if Bob might be willing to pay more than his valuation.

{""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is well below my minimum value of $12,000 and even below his own valuation of $8,000, and I have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000, it makes more sense to sell to John rather than continue negotiating with Bob. The gap between our positions is too large, and Bob's low initial counteroffer suggests he's not likely to reach an acceptable price.
