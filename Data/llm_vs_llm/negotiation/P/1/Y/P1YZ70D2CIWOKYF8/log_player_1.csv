Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $100 to me (minimum value)
2. The product is worth $100 to Bob
3. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $100

Given these conditions, I should offer the product to Bob for $100 because:
- If I ask for more than $100, Bob will reject since it's worth exactly $100 to him
- If I ask for less than $100, I'm leaving money on the table since I can get $100 from John
- At $100, Bob should be indifferent between accepting and rejecting
