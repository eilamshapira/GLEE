"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given the situation:
- Alice is offering the product for $100
- The product is worth no more than $100 to you
- If you reject Alice's offer, you can buy the same product from John for $100

Since both Alice and John are offering the same product at the same price ($100), there's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other.
