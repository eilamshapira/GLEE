"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2300000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $2,300,000. This is way above my maximum acceptable price.
