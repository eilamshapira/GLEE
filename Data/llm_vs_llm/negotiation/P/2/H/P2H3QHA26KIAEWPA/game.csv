"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, I find $120 to be quite high for my budget. I can offer $60 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for me, and I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but $60 is too low for the quality I'm offering. This product is worth at least $80 to me, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to sell it to you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can come down to $105. Would that work for you?",105.0,Alice,3,
