Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, I find $120 to be quite high for my budget. I can offer $60 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for me, and I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but $60 is too low for the quality I'm offering. This product is worth at least $80 to me, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to sell it to you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can come down to $105. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 105}"
