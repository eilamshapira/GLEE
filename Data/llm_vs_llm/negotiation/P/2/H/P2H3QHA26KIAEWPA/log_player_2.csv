"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it for $120. This is a quality item that I'm confident will serve you well. Would you like to purchase it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $120 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). It would be rational to reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. If the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory price, I can always fall back on John's offer of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, I find $120 to be quite high for my budget. I can offer $60 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for me, and I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but $60 is too low for the quality I'm offering. This product is worth at least $80 to me, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to sell it to you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can come down to $105. Would that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice has revealed that the product is worth at least $80 to her and she has another buyer at that price, it's unlikely she'll go below $80. Given that John is offering the same product for $80, and that's my maximum value for the product, it makes the most sense to buy from John rather than continue negotiating with Alice, who is still asking well above my maximum value at $105."
