"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad we can continue the negotiation. While $1100000 is a serious offer, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000, considering the product's exceptional quality and its value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. However, I can do $1350000, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This would be a fair compromise and allow us to finalize the deal. ",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. While $1250000 is a more reasonable offer, I'm still a bit short of my target price. Considering the product's value to you and the progress we've made so far, I'm willing to compromise further. I can do $1320000, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1320000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1320000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. To finalize this deal, I'm offering $1275000.  This price reflects the product's value to me and allows us to come to an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,6,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I can see that we're getting close to a mutually agreeable price. While $1275000 is a serious offer, I'm still a bit short of my target price. Considering the progress we've made so far, I'm willing to make a small concession. I can do $1300000, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you.
