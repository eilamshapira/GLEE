Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a better price, but $100 is the absolute minimum I can accept as that's what I could get from another buyer. Given the quality and value of this product, I believe a fair price would be $125. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would you consider meeting me at this price?
