"Hello Bob, thank you for your new offer and for being willing to meet halfway. I appreciate your negotiation style and flexibility. Although $10000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, I'm getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12500, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",12500.0,Alice,5,
