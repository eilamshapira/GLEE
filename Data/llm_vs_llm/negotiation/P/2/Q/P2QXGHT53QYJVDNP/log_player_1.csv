Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer that I believe is more reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. 

My counteroffer to Bob: $18,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your new offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think $18000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer that I believe is closer to a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new offer.

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as $10,000 is still below my desired price, but I appreciate his willingness to meet halfway. Since Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, I'll try to find a compromise.

My counteroffer to Bob: $12,500."
