"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the premium product. However, the price of $2500000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $500000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $500000 is significantly below the product's value. Given the quality and market conditions, I can offer it to you for $2000000. This is already a substantial reduction from my initial offer.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you, Alice, for considering my previous offer and reducing the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2000000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. I'd like to propose a price of $1250000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
