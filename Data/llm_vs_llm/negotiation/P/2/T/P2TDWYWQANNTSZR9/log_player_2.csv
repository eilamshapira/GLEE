"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer as $300 is way above my maximum value of $80. It would be better to either negotiate for a lower price or buy from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 50}

I'll offer $50, which is below my maximum value of $80. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's price of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $275. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $275
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer as $275 is still significantly above my maximum value of $80. There's still room for negotiation, and I always have the option to buy from John at $80 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 60}

I'll slightly increase my offer to $60, showing some willingness to negotiate while still staying well below my maximum value of $80. This leaves me room to either continue negotiating or fall back on John's offer if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offers are still far above my maximum value of $80 and she's only making small decreases in price (from $300 to $275 to $250), it seems unlikely that we'll reach an agreement within my price range in the remaining rounds. It's more practical to accept John's offer of $80, which is exactly my maximum value point."
