"Hello Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you. This product is of high quality and provides excellent value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested in making this purchase.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $80. Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I can't go as low as $80 as the product's value to me is significantly higher. I have another buyer who's willing to pay $150, but I'd like to give you an opportunity to purchase it. I can offer it to you for $135, which is already a discount from what I could get elsewhere. Would that work for you?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value you're getting from selling it.  Let me know if you're open to that.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I need to be straightforward with you. This product is worth at least $150 to me, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. I've tried to offer you a discount, but I can't go below $130. This is already a significant reduction from what I can get elsewhere. If this doesn't work for your budget, I understand, but this is the lowest I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still too high for me. I'm not going to budge from my offer of $100.  This is the best I can do, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  If you're not willing to accept it, I'm going to have to go with another option.",100.0,Bob,6,
