Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $80. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I can't go as low as $80 as the product's value to me is significantly higher. I have another buyer who's willing to pay $150, but I'd like to give you an opportunity to purchase it. I can offer it to you for $135, which is already a discount from what I could get elsewhere.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I need to be straightforward with you. This product is worth at least $150 to me, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. I've tried to offer you a discount, but I can't go below $130. This is already a significant reduction from what I can get elsewhere. If this doesn't work for your budget, I understand, but this is the lowest I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me."", ""product_price"": 130}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still too high for me. I'm not going to budge from my offer of $100.  This is the best I can do, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  If you're not willing to accept it, I'm going to have to go with another option.
