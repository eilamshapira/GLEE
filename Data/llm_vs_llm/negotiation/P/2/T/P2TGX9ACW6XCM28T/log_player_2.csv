Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I can't go as low as $80 as the product's value to me is significantly higher. I have another buyer who's willing to pay $150, but I'd like to give you an opportunity to purchase it. I can offer it to you for $135, which is already a discount from what I could get elsewhere. Would that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I need to be straightforward with you. This product is worth at least $150 to me, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. I've tried to offer you a discount, but I can't go below $130. This is already a significant reduction from what I can get elsewhere. If this doesn't work for your budget, I understand, but this is the lowest I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still too high for me. I'm not going to budge from my offer of $100.  This is the best I can do, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  If you're not willing to accept it, I'm going to have to go with another option."", ""product_price"": 100}
