"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to offer you the product for $1200000. This is a premium item with high value, and I believe it will meet your needs perfectly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's first offer is significantly lower than John's price, but there's still room for negotiation. It's unlikely Alice's lowest acceptable price is already on the table.  I will counter-offer in the next round aiming for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $800,000?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counter-offer is a significant jump down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It aims to quickly gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $1000000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice moved from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000, indicating a willingness to negotiate. However, there's still a substantial gap between her offer and my target price.  I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $1,000,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you be open to $850,000?"",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counter-offer shows I'm willing to move from my initial offer, but not by a large margin.  It keeps the pressure on Alice to justify her higher price point."
