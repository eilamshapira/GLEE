"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering the product for $150, but the product is only worth $120 to me at most. Meanwhile, I can definitely buy the same product from John for $120, which matches exactly what I value the product at.

Since Alice's price ($150) exceeds my maximum valuation ($120), and I have a guaranteed alternative at my maximum valuation ($120 from John), the rational choice is clear.
