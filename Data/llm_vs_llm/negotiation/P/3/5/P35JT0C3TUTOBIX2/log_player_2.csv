"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product today. Based on the exceptional quality and value it provides, I'm offering it to you for $1200000. This product has been highly sought after in the market, and I believe it would be a valuable asset for you. While I have another buyer, John, already interested, I wanted to give you the first opportunity to acquire it. Would you like to proceed with this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since Alice's offer is exactly the same as what John is willing to sell it for, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. Buying from John is the same outcome, but without the potential risk of Alice changing her mind or offering a higher price later."
