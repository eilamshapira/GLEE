"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be really useful, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. How about we bring the price down a bit? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, I will not accept it. Additionally, selling to John for $8,000 is a better option than accepting Bob's offer, but I still want to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 might be out of your budget, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and find a middle ground. How about we meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. While $9500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you consider something closer to $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","This is an interesting turn of events. Bob's new offer of $8,000 is exactly the same as what John is willing to pay. Since I don't know if Bob will be willing to pay more, and I have the option to sell to John for the same price, I will choose to accept Bob's offer. This way, I can close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiations not yielding a better price.
