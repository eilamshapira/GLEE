Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is more than I'm looking to spend. Given that similar products are available for less, I can offer $120 for your product. This is a fair price that works within my budget.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend less, but I believe the product is worth more than $120. I'm willing to come down from my initial price, so let's meet in the middle. I can offer you the product for $180."
