"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $200. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer of $200 is more expensive than both my maximum budget ($150) and John's price ($150), it wouldn't make sense to accept it. While I could buy from John immediately, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first to potentially get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's below my maximum price but leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is more than I'm looking to spend. Given that similar products are available for less, I can offer $120 for your product. This is a fair price that works within my budget."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I've considered your offer and I'm willing to lower my price. I can offer you the product for $180. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $180 is still above both my maximum budget ($150) and John's price ($150). While she's showing willingness to negotiate by reducing the price, it's still not a good deal for me. I'll reject and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer slightly but still stay well below my maximum price to maintain room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $180 is still more than I can spend. I know the product is available elsewhere for $150. However, I'd like to work with you and can increase my offer to $130. This would be a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I've considered your offer and I'm willing to lower my price further. I can offer you the product for $165. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and your budget. I believe it is closer to what you are looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's offer of $165 is still above John's price of $150. Since I know I can get the product for $150 from John, and Alice's price is still above that after several rounds of negotiation, it makes more sense to buy from John rather than continue negotiating.
