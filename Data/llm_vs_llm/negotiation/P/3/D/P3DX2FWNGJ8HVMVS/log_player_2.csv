"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I've taken into account its value to you, and I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth $100 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $100
3. John is selling the same product for $100

Since all prices are the same ($100), and there's no difference in the product value, it doesn't matter economically from whom I buy the product. However, since Alice has already engaged in conversation and made an effort to communicate, it would be more courteous to accept her offer rather than reject it or buy from John.
