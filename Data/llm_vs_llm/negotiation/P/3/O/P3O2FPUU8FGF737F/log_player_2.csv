"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price for such a product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to consider my options carefully:

1. Alice's offer is $12,000, which exceeds the $8,000 maximum value the product is worth to me.
2. John is offering the same product for $8,000, which is equal to my maximum valuation.
3. I could reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, but since I already have an alternative at my maximum acceptable price, there's little benefit in continuing negotiations with Alice unless I believe I can get it for less than $8,000.

Given that the product is only worth $8,000 to me, and John's offer matches this exactly, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
