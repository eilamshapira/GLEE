# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the updated offer and for sharing the information about John's willingness to buy the product from you for $1500000. I understand that this sets a minimum market value, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1550000. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to propose a price of $1350000. This price reflects a serious commitment to purchasing the product while also being mindful of my financial constraints.

I understand you're trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us. However, I need to be clear that since John is willing to pay $1,500,000, I cannot accept anything below that amount. The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and accepting less would not make business sense. Given your interest, I'm willing to offer you the product at exactly $1,500,000 - the same price John is willing to pay.
