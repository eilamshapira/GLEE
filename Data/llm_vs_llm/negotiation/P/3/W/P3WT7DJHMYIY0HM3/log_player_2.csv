Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must inform you that your offer of $1200000 is below what I can accept. You mentioned you have another option to buy from John at this price, but I should clarify that John is actually willing to buy this product from me for $1500000. This establishes the minimum market value I can accept. Given the product's worth, I'm willing to come down from my initial price to $1550000, which still provides you with significant value while meeting my minimum requirements.

Considering the product's value and my budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to propose a price of $1,350,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your continued interest in the product and for your offer of $1350000. I understand you're trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us. However, I need to be clear that since John is willing to pay $1500000, I cannot accept anything below that amount. The product is worth at least $1500000 to me, and accepting less would not make business sense. Given your interest, I'm willing to offer you the product at exactly $1500000 - the same price John is willing to pay. This is my final offer, which allows you to acquire the product without me having to pursue the alternative buyer.
