"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is clearly too high, as it's nearly double the price I can get from John ($800,000). I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round that's more reasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 600000}

Rationale: I'm starting with a price below John's price ($800,000) to give room for negotiation. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground that's still below John's price. This way, both parties might benefit - I could get a better price than John's offer, and Alice could make a sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly higher than John's price of $800,000. While Alice has reduced the price from her initial offer, it's still not competitive with my alternative option. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round, though if Alice doesn't come down to a more reasonable price soon, I may need to consider taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

Rationale: I'm increasing my offer by $100,000 from my previous bid to show willingness to negotiate, but still staying below John's price of $800,000. This offer signals that I'm serious about making a deal but need the price to be competitive with my alternative option. The price of $700,000 leaves some room for further negotiation while still potentially giving both parties a better deal than my alternative with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Rationale: It's clear that Alice is not willing to negotiate to a price point that makes sense for me. Her latest offer of $1,400,000 is actually higher than her previous offer of $1,300,000, showing she's moving in the wrong direction. Given that:
1. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation
2. Alice's prices remain significantly above John's $800,000 offer
3. Alice seems to be increasing rather than decreasing her price
4. We have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000

It's time to end the negotiation and take John's offer. There's no indication that Alice will come down to a competitive price, and continuing the negotiation would just waste more time."
