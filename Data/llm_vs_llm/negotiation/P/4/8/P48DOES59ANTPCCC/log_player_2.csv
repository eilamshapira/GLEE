"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm currently offering it for $12000. This product has exceptional quality and features that make it stand out in the market. I have another interested buyer, John, who is ready to purchase it, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $8,000
2. Alice is offering the product for $12,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $8,000

Since:
- Alice's offer ($12,000) is significantly higher than my maximum value ($8,000)
- I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $8,000
- Accepting Alice's offer would mean paying $4,000 more than my maximum value
- Accepting Alice's offer would mean paying $4,000 more than John's price

The logical choice is to buy from John at $8,000.
