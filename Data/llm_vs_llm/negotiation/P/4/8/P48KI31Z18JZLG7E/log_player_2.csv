"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

It's way too early to accept this offer. Alice's starting price is significantly higher than our alternative option ($10,000 from John). We have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 6000}

**Reasoning:** Starting with a strong lowball offer. This accomplishes two things:

* **Gauges Alice's bottom line:** Her reaction will give us an idea of how low she's willing to go. 
* **Establishes a strong negotiating position:** Even if she rejects it outright, we've set a lower bound for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice dropping to $10,000 so quickly after our low counteroffer suggests there's still room for negotiation. It's risky, but we might be able to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 7500}

**Reasoning:**  We're meeting in the middle after her aggressive counter. This shows willingness to negotiate but also that we're aiming for a price significantly below her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

This is a good deal! We've managed to get a $1,000 discount from both Alice's starting price and John's alternative offer. Accepting now secures a win and avoids the risk of further haggling."
