"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what the product is worth to you. You should definitely counter-offer.  Buying from John right now is a possibility, but you can probably negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

This is a starting offer. It's low, but it leaves room for negotiation and lets Alice know you're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

```

Alice is coming down, but it's still too high. We'll keep negotiating for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to move, but it's important we make significant progress towards a price that works for me."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While Alice is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price, it's still not a good deal for us. We'll continue negotiating and see if we can get the price closer to our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 950000
}

I'm edging closer to $1,000,000, but I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate within a smaller range now."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

This is a tricky situation. Alice has come down to her minimum price, but it's still above your budget.  We have a few rounds left to negotiate, but there's a real risk Alice won't budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 980000
}
```

This is a strong signal that I'm willing to meet Alice near her minimum, but I'm still not budging over $1,000,000."
