"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit high. Would you consider selling it for $1000000? I believe this price would be more aligned with my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I’m willing to meet you halfway. How about a price of $1100000? I believe this reflects the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming halfway, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I think $1100000 is still a bit high. Would you consider selling it for $950000? I believe this price would be more feasible for me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
