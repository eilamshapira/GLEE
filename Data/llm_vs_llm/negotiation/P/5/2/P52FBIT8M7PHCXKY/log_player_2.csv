"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for showing interest in the product. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $16500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $16,500, which is significantly above my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $12,000

It would not be rational to accept Alice's offer of $16,500 as it's much higher than both my maximum value and John's alternative offer. Even though I could try to negotiate with Alice by rejecting and making a counteroffer, since John's offer ($12,000) matches my maximum value, it's best to take the guaranteed option.
