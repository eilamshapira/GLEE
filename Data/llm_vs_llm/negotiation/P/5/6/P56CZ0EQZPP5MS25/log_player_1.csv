Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $85 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($80), but lower than what I initially offered ($100), I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll try to meet Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. Since he offered $85 and I initially offered $100, I'll counteroffer at $97.50, but to make it simpler, I'll round it down to $95, and then further to $90 to increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer, and also to leave some room for further negotiation if needed, but still close to my desired price.

{""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my desired price, and it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. Considering that Bob's willingness to pay is $100, I believe I can still get a better price. However, I also need to weigh the risk of losing the sale if I push too hard.

Given that Bob has already increased his offer from $85 to $90, I'll try to split the difference again. Since my last offer was $95 and Bob's current offer is $90, I could counteroffer at $92.50, but to simplify and increase the chances of acceptance, I might consider accepting $90 or making a small concession.

For now, I'll reject the $90 offer to see if Bob is willing to go higher, but I'm getting closer to accepting.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's last offer was $90, and I was considering splitting the difference between my last offer of $95 and his $90, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one but still higher than Bob's last offer. I'll offer $92, which is a small concession from my side and shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also indicates that I'm not willing to go as low as $90.

{""product_price"": 92}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer of $91 is very close to my last counteroffer of $92. At this point, I'm starting to feel that we're nearing a mutually acceptable price. Considering that Bob's willingness to pay is $100 and he's already come up significantly from his initial offer of $85, I believe $91 is a reasonable price.

Given that I have the option to sell to John for $80, which is significantly lower than Bob's current offer, and considering that I've already invested time in negotiating with Bob, I think it's worth accepting $91. It's a good compromise, and it's close enough to my desired price that I feel I've negotiated a fair deal.
