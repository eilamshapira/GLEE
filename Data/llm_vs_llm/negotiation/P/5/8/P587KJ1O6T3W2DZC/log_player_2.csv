# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it extremely valuable.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","**{

Let's see if I can get a better deal.

**My counteroffer:**
Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I'm looking to spend no more than $8,000. Would you be willing to accept this price?
