Send your offer to Bob.,"After analyzing the situation, I'll make my offer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1200000}

Rationale: Since I know I can definitely sell the product to John for $1,200,000, and this is also my minimum acceptable price, there's no reason to offer Bob a lower price. Even though the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, any price lower than $1,200,000 would result in less profit for me. If Bob rejects this offer (which he likely will since it exceeds his valuation), I can still sell to John at the same price, ensuring my maximum possible profit."
