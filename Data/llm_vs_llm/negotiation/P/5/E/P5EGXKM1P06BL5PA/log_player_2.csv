"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $1,200,000 against my alternatives.

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $800,000.

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 exceeds the value of the product to me, and it's also $400,000 more than John's price. It wouldn't make economic sense for me to accept Alice's offer.
