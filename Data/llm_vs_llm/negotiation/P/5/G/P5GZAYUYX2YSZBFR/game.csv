"Hello Bob, I'm excited about the possibility of you acquiring this product. Given its unique qualities and the value it brings, I'm offering it to you for $18000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8000, considering the product's value and my own financial constraints.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While I understand budget constraints, $8000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $16500.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet in the middle. However, $16500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering my budget and the product's value, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9500. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but we're still a bit apart. My absolute minimum is $15500. This is below what I initially wanted, but I'm willing to make this concession for you. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your concession and willingness to lower the price to $15500. However, I'm still looking to get a better deal. Considering my budget and the fact that I can get a similar product from John for $10000, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10500. This is a bit higher than John's offer, but I prefer to work with you and believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Bob,6,
