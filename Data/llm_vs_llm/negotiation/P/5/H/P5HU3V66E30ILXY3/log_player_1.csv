"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($15,000) and also lower than what the product is worth to him ($12,000), I will reject his offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be $17,000, aiming to maximize my earnings while still being in the realm of what could be considered reasonable given the product's worth to Bob.

Since we are only in Round 4 and I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, I will reject his offer and proceed to make another counteroffer.

This time, I will slightly reduce my previous offer to show willingness to negotiate, but still aim to get a price closer to the product's value to Bob.

You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to the product's worth to him ($12,000), but it's still below my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and not ideal. However, considering we are halfway through the negotiation rounds, I need to weigh the potential of reaching a deal with Bob against the certainty of selling to John for $15,000.

Given that Bob's offers are incrementally increasing and he's now at $11,000, I'll make a strategic decision to meet him closer to the middle but still ensure I'm getting a good deal. I'll counteroffer at $14,500, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price and takes into account Bob's increasing offers.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Considering we are in Round 8 and nearing the end of our negotiation rounds, I need to make a decision that balances the potential for a higher offer from Bob with the risk of not reaching a deal and the certainty of selling to John for $15,000.

Given that Bob has incrementally increased his offer and is now at $11,500, and considering I have a guaranteed sale price of $15,000 from John, I will reject Bob's offer. However, since we are close to the end of the negotiation and Bob's last increase was only $500, I will make a final counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous one but still higher than Bob's current offer, in an attempt to meet him at a mutually beneficial price.
