"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. After careful consideration of its market value and unique features, I'm pricing it at $2200000. This product represents a significant opportunity with substantial long-term value. I'd be happy to discuss any questions you might have about its specifications or benefits.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $2200000 is significantly above my budget and valuation for this product. The market value for similar products is much lower, and I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $800000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I can offer $650000, which I believe is fair considering the market conditions.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in doing business with me. However, I must point out that your offer of $650000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm aware of current market conditions, but this product has unique qualities that justify its premium price. I also want to mention that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1500000 for this product. That said, I'm willing to offer you a substantial discount from my initial price. My counteroffer is $1600000, which is considerably more favorable than market rates for a product of this caliber.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1600000 is still far above what makes economic sense for me. While your product may have unique qualities, I need to be practical about my budget constraints. I should clarify that John is actually an alternative seller I'm considering, not another buyer competing with me. He's offering the identical product for $800000, which is my absolute ceiling for this purchase. To continue our negotiation in good faith, I'm willing to offer $700000, which provides you with a better deal than my previous offer while still being within my financial parameters.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your clarification. I think there's been a misunderstanding. John isn't a competing seller - he's an alternative buyer who has already committed to purchasing my product for $1500000. This is the minimum value the product holds for me, as it represents my guaranteed alternative. While I understand your budget constraints, I simply cannot sell below this threshold as it would mean losing money. However, I'm willing to offer you the product at $1500000 exactly - the same price John is willing to pay. This represents my absolute minimum price, and I'm offering it to you because I'd prefer to do business with you if possible.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I think there continues to be confusion. To be completely clear: John is a separate seller who has offered to sell me the same product for $800000. This isn't a negotiation tactic - it's simply my alternative option. Based on my market research and budget constraints, $800000 represents the maximum value this product has for me. Since we seem to be at an impasse, I'll make one final reasonable offer of $750000. If we can't reach an agreement at or below my maximum budget of $800000, I will simply proceed with purchasing from John. I hope we can find common ground, but I must remain firm on my budget ceiling.",750000.0,Bob,6,
