"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. After careful consideration of its market value and unique features, I'm pricing it at $2200000. This product represents a significant opportunity with substantial long-term value. I'd be happy to discuss any questions you might have about its specifications or benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's initial offer of $2,200,000 is significantly higher than both my valuation of the product ($800,000) and John's alternative price ($800,000). There's no reason to accept this offer.

Since I can always buy from John for $800,000, I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. This gives me a chance to potentially purchase the product for less than $800,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget and valuation for this product. The market value for similar products is much lower, and I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $800,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I can offer $650,000, which I believe is fair considering the market conditions."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in doing business with me. However, I must point out that your offer of $650000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm aware of current market conditions, but this product has unique qualities that justify its premium price. I also want to mention that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1500000 for this product. That said, I'm willing to offer you a substantial discount from my initial price. My counteroffer is $1600000, which is considerably more favorable than market rates for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,600,000 is still double my maximum valuation of the product ($800,000) and double what I would pay to John. The mention of another buyer named John is interesting (and likely a negotiation tactic), but doesn't change my position since I already know I can buy from John for $800,000.

I should reject this offer and continue negotiating, as we're still far apart on price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,600,000 is still far above what makes economic sense for me. While your product may have unique qualities, I need to be practical about my budget constraints. I should clarify that John is actually an alternative seller I'm considering, not another buyer competing with me. He's offering the identical product for $800,000, which is my absolute ceiling for this purchase. To continue our negotiation in good faith, I'm willing to offer $700,000, which provides you with a better deal than my previous offer while still being within my financial parameters."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your clarification. I think there's been a misunderstanding. John isn't a competing seller - he's an alternative buyer who has already committed to purchasing my product for $1500000. This is the minimum value the product holds for me, as it represents my guaranteed alternative. While I understand your budget constraints, I simply cannot sell below this threshold as it would mean losing money. However, I'm willing to offer you the product at $1500000 exactly - the same price John is willing to pay. This represents my absolute minimum price, and I'm offering it to you because I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice is creating confusion with her claim about John. In our scenario, John is definitely an alternative seller offering me the product for $800,000, not a competing buyer as she claims.

Her offer of $1,500,000 is still nearly twice what I can pay to John ($800,000) and exceeds my maximum valuation. There's no reason to accept this offer when I have a much better alternative.

Since we're still far apart on price and Alice seems to be using questionable negotiation tactics, I'll reject again.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I think there continues to be confusion. To be completely clear: John is a separate seller who has offered to sell me the same product for $800,000. This isn't a negotiation tactic - it's simply my alternative option. Based on my market research and budget constraints, $800,000 represents the maximum value this product has for me. Since we seem to be at an impasse, I'll make one final reasonable offer of $750,000. If we can't reach an agreement at or below my maximum budget of $800,000, I will simply proceed with purchasing from John. I hope we can find common ground, but I must remain firm on my budget ceiling."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
