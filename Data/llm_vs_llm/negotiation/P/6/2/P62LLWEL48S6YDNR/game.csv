"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. How about we settle on $90? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'm getting.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth more than $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. How about we settle on $100? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $100 is still a bit high for me. How about we go for $95? I think this is a reasonable compromise given our previous offers.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Considering your offer of $95, I'm willing to make a small concession. How about we settle on $98? I think this is a fair price, and it's the lowest I'm comfortable going. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",98.0,Alice,5,
