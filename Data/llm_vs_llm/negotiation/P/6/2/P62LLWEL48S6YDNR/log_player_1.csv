"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $110, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. How about we settle on $90? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'm getting. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $90 is still lower than my target price, and I believe I can get a better deal. Selling to John for $80 is also not ideal, as I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth more than $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. How about we settle on $100? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and quality."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $100 is still a bit high for me. How about we go for $95? I think this is a reasonable compromise given our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. While $95 is getting closer to my target price, I still believe I can get a better deal. Since Bob is willing to compromise, I'll try to meet him closer to the middle of our previous offers. Selling to John for $80 is still not a viable option, as I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Considering your offer of $95, I'm willing to make a small concession. How about we settle on $98? I think this is a fair price, and it's the lowest I'm comfortable going. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 98}"
