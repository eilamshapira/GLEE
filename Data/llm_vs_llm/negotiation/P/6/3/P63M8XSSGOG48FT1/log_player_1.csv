(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $110 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($100), but still lower than my initial offer, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

My counteroffer will be $130.

So, my decision is:

My decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

My decision is:
