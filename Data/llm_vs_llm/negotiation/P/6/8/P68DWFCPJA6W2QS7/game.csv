"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, the price is a bit too high for me at the moment. Considering my budget, I'm willing to offer $8000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest. I understand budget constraints, but $8000 is too low for this product's value. I paid $12000 for it myself, so I can't go below that price. However, I can reduce my initial offer significantly. Would you consider $16000? This product offers excellent quality and durability that justifies this investment.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $16000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9000. This is my final offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but $9000 is still significantly below my cost. I need to at least cover what I paid for it, which was $12000. I can offer it to you for $14500, which is a substantial reduction from my initial price. This is a very competitive offer for the quality you're receiving.",14500.0,Alice,5,
