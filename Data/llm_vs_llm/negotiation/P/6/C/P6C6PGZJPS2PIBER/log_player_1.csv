Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. 

Since I know I can definitely get $150 from John, that's my fallback position. This means I should offer Bob a price higher than $150 to potentially maximize my profit. Bob may value the product significantly higher than $150, and since this is my only chance to sell to Bob, I should aim for a meaningful premium over my guaranteed $150.

I'll set the price at $225, which is 50% higher than my guaranteed price. This gives Bob room to still get value if they value the product higher than my price, while giving me a significant upside if they accept.
