"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $13500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth.",13500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I believe $13500 is a bit high for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000, which I think is a fair price considering my needs and the product's value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is too low considering the product's true value. I understand your budget constraints, but I can come down to $12000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents excellent value for this product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the reduction in price, but I still think $12000 is a bit out of my budget. Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10500. I believe this is a fair compromise between our two positions.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I see we're making progress in our negotiation. While $10500 is moving in the right direction, I can go down to $11200 as my final offer. This represents a substantial discount from my initial price and is a fair value considering the product's worth.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the further reduction in price. Considering we're getting close to a mutually agreeable price, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10800. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to meet you close to the middle.",10800.0,Bob,6,
