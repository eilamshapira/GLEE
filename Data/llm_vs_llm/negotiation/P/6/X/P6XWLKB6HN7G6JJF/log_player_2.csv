"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since the offered price of $2,500,000 is more than twice the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000), it's not a good deal for me. I'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000, I'll offer a price that is substantially lower than that to leave room for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $2,000,000 is still significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. While it's a $500,000 reduction from her initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate a better price. Since Alice reduced her price, it shows she's willing to negotiate, so I'll try to meet her halfway between my previous offer and her new offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Next, I'll send a new counteroffer to Alice. 

{""product_price"": $1,000,000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I've already sent my counteroffer in the previous message. To reiterate:

{""product_price"": $1,000,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,800,000 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. It's getting closer to my maximum budget of $1,200,000, but it's still $600,000 above that.

At this point, I think it's clear that Alice is not willing to sell the product to me at a price I'm comfortable with. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which is still below Alice's current offer, I think it's time to stop negotiating with Alice.
