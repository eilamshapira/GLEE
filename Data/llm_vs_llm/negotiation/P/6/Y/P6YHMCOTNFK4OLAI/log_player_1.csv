Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic decision here. The product is worth at least $8,000 to me, and exactly $8,000 to Bob. I already have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's no reason for me to accept anything less from Bob.

Since I know Bob values the item at $8,000, I could offer at exactly that price, which would make him indifferent between accepting and rejecting. However, I'll start slightly higher to leave room for negotiation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $7,600 since it's below the $8,000 that John is willing to pay, and also below my minimum value for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my initial offer of $8,200 and countered with $7,600, I'll adjust my price. However, I won't go below $8,000 since I have John's guaranteed offer at that price. I'll move closer to what would be acceptable to Bob while maintaining my bottom line.
