Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be very interested in. Considering its value, I'm offering it to you for $11,500."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $10500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Okay, given Bob's counteroffer, I need to consider my options carefully. Selling to John is the immediate fallback, guaranteeing me $10,000. Bob's offer of $10,500 is better, but I also know he values the product at $12,000. I think I can push for a bit more.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit over my budget at $11000.  How about $10750?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Alright, Bob is still pushing for a lower price. He's offered $10,750. While that's more than what John is offering, I'm aiming for as much profit as possible. I also know Bob values it at $12,000, which gives me some room to negotiate. I'll try one more time.
