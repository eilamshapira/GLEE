Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer to Bob for the product that is worth at least $1,200,000 to me. Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll need to choose a price that gives me a good chance of making more than my guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, while not being so high that Bob will automatically reject it.

I should consider that:
1. My BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement) is $1,200,000 from John
2. Any amount above $1,200,000 from Bob would be better for me
3. Setting the price too high risks Bob rejecting it entirely
4. Setting the price only slightly above $1,200,000 guarantees only a small improvement

I'll offer a moderately higher price that gives Bob room to feel like he's getting value while still significantly improving my position:

{""product_price"": 1,650,000}"
