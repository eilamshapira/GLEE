"Alice,  $1150000 is a bit steep for me.  While I'm interested in the product,  I'm only willing to pay $1050000.  This price is fair, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, I value this product quite highly. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as $1050000. How about $1100000? I think that's a very fair price considering the benefit you will get from owning it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1100000 is closer, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $1050000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1075000? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,,
