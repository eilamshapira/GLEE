This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential value. I look forward to your response.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering the product for $2,400,000, which is significantly higher than the maximum value of $1,200,000 that the product is worth to you. Additionally, you have the option to buy the same product from John for $1,200,000, which matches your maximum valuation.

Since your goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and Alice's offer exceeds both your maximum valuation and John's price, the logical choice would be to buy from John.
