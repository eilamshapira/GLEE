"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $250. I think you'll find it's a great deal.",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $50. I believe it's a fair price, considering I can also buy it from John for $80.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $50 is significantly below the product's value.  You mentioned John is selling it for $80? I'm not sure where you got that information, as I happen to know he's not selling it for less than $150. I'm willing to come down to $200. This is a very competitive price.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $200 is still a bit steep for me. I'm confident that John is willing to sell it to me for $80, and I'd rather not pay more than that if I don't have to. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your new offer. How about $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best possible deal. However, I'm certain about John's price.  I'm still willing to move a bit, how about $175?  This is my final offer.",175.0,Alice,5,
