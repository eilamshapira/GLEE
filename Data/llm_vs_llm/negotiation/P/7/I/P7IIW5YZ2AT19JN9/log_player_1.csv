"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $50. I believe it's a fair price, considering I can also buy it from John for $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $50 is significantly below the product's value.  You mentioned John is selling it for $80? I'm not sure where you got that information, as I happen to know he's not selling it for less than $150. I'm willing to come down to $200. This is a very competitive price."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $200 is still a bit steep for me. I'm confident that John is willing to sell it to me for $80, and I'd rather not pay more than that if I don't have to. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your new offer. How about $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
