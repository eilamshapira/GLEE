Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $250 is a bit out of my budget.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $50 is significantly below the product's value.  You mentioned John is selling it for $80? I'm not sure where you got that information, as I happen to know he's not selling it for less than $150. I'm willing to come down to $200. This is a very competitive price.

I'm confident that John is willing to sell it to me for $80, and I'd rather not pay more than that if I don't have to. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your new offer.
