,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $600000, considering the market value and my budget. I'd love to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, I'm confident the product is worth significantly more than $600000. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'm prepared to sell it to you for $2750000.",2750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Meeting in the middle of my previous offer and your initial offer is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I still believe we're quite far apart. While I'm willing to continue negotiating, I need to be closer to the product's true value. To show my commitment to working with you, I'll lower my price to $2500000. This is a significant decrease, and I hope you'll reconsider your offer.",2500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate and the significant decrease in price. However, $2500000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, but I need to stay within my means. I'm going to increase my offer to $750000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. I hope this demonstrates my interest in the product and we can find a mutually agreeable price.",750000.0,Bob,6,
