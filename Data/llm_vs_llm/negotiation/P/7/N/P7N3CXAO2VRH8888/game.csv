"Bob, I'm excited to finally begin discussing the sale of this exceptional product with you. Given its unique capabilities and the significant value it can bring to your organization, I'm initially offering it for $1500000. I'm confident that this price reflects the immense potential ROI you'll realize.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is beyond our budget. I can offer $900000 for the product, as that aligns better with our financial plans. I hope we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $900000. While it's lower than my initial price, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1300000? This is a substantial reduction from my original offer and I believe reflects a fair valuation of the product's benefits to your company.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1300000 is still higher than what we can allocate for this purchase. I can offer $850000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering our budget constraints.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand budget constraints, but $850000 is a bit too low. I'm getting closer to my absolute minimum here. I can come down to $1200000. This is a significant concession on my part. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1200000 is still too high for us. I can offer $800000 for the product. I hope you can consider this, as it aligns more closely with our budget.",800000.0,Bob,6,
