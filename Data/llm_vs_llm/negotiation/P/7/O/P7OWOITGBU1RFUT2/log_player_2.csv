"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2000000. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm open to negotiations if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $2,000,000, which is double my maximum value
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $1,000,000

The logical choice is to buy from John. Even if I try to negotiate with Alice, starting from $2,000,000 means we are very far apart, and there's no guarantee we'll reach a price below $1,000,000. Plus, I have a guaranteed option to buy at my maximum value right now.
