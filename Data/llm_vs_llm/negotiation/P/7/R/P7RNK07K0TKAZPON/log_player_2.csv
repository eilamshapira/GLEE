"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given the information:
- The product is worth no more than $12,000 to you
- Alice is offering it for $15,000
- John will sell it to you for $12,000

Alice's asking price ($15,000) is higher than both John's price and the maximum value of the product to you. Since John's price matches your maximum value for the product, there's no reason to pay more or continue negotiating with Alice.
