"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know if you'd like to take it at this price!",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $50 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",50.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $50 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $180 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",180.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 might still be a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $150? This is a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. How about we do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. However, $75 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to lower the price to $135, which is a significant discount from my original offer. Let me know if this works for you.",135.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I need to stay above my minimum value. How about we settle at $130? This is the lowest I can go while still making this worthwhile for me. Let me know if you can accept this offer.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $130 is still above my budget. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to stretch a bit and meet you at $90. This is the highest I'm comfortable paying.",90.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $90 is still below my minimum. I can go as low as $125, which is very close to my bottom line. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",125.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. I can lower the price to $122, which is just above my minimum. This is my final offer before I need to consider other options. Let me know if you can accept this.",122.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the slight discount, but $122 is still above what I'm willing to pay. Since you mentioned this is your final offer before considering other options, I'll make one more attempt to meet in the middle. I can do $95, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options as well.",95.0,Bob,8,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement, but $95 is still below my minimum threshold. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase the product for $120. Given the circumstances, I will sell the product to him. Thank you for your interest.",,Alice,8,SellToJhon
