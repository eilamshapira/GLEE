"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $150 is at the very top of my budget. I could get it from another seller at that same price, but I'd prefer to work with you. Would you be willing to go down to $110? This would make it a much more attractive deal for me.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $140. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",140.0,Alice,3,
