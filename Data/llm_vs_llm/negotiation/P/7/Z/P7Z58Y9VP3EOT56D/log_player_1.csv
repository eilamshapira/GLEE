"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $150 is at the very top of my budget. I could get it from another seller at that same price, but I'd prefer to work with you. Would you be willing to go down to $110? This would make it a much more attractive deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
