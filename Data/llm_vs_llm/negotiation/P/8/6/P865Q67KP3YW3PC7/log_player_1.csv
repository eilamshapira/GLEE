Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Let me know if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
