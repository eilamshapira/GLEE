Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","$400,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, so I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still maintain a price well above my minimum threshold.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $500,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and he's not showing significant movement in his offers (from $400,000 to $500,000). Given that we've already gone through 4 rounds and Bob's offers are still far below even John's guaranteed price, I'll take the safe option and sell to John.
