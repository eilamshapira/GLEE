"Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you today. I think you'll find it very valuable.  I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $80 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $130 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $90. I think this is a reasonable price, considering we're both trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $90 is still pretty low for me.  What if we split the difference again and call it $110?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I see we're getting closer to a deal. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still looking for a better price. Considering John is offering the same product for $100, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $95. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal with you if we can meet at this point.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're really attached to that $95 price, huh?  It's not exactly what I wanted, but I'm ready to close this deal. Let's call it $105 and shake on it. This is my final offer.",105.0,Alice,7,
