Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $800,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $800,000
3. Bob knows the product's value to him is $800,000
4. If Bob rejects, I'm not worse off as I have John's offer

Given these factors, I'll offer slightly below Bob's maximum value to give him a small incentive to accept while maximizing my profit:

{""product_price"": 799,000}"
