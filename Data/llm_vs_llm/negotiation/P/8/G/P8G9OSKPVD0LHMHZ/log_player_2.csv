"Alice's offer: The product price will be $799,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $799,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Let me evaluate the offers:

- Alice is offering the product for $799,000
- John is offering the product for $800,000
- The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me

Alice's offer is $1,000 less than John's offer, and both are within my maximum value for the product. It makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer since it saves me money.
