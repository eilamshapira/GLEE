"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was looking to spend no more than $80 on this product. Would you be willing to sell it for this price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $80 is a bit too low for me, as I value this product at at least $150. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $220.",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $220 is still too high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $100. How about that?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $100 is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to sell it for. Given that you are interested in buying, how about we try $190?",190.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $190 is still more than I'm willing to spend. I can offer $110 for the product.",110.0,Bob,6,
