"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer is the same price as John's offer ($150), and it's the maximum I'm willing to pay, I should reject and try to negotiate a better price with Alice. If the negotiation fails, I can always go back to John's offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a significantly lower offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low that it would be considered unreasonable.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has reduced her price to $135, which is $15 less than both her initial offer and John's price. This is a good improvement, but there might still be room for negotiation. Since I can always fall back to John's offer of $150, I'll try one more round of negotiation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still try to get a better deal than Alice's $135.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has now offered $125, which is a good price - $25 less than John's price and $10 lower than her previous offer. Given that we've already negotiated several rounds and she's shown willingness to reduce the price significantly from the initial $150, this seems like a fair deal. I'll accept this offer rather than risk losing the progress we've made in negotiations.
