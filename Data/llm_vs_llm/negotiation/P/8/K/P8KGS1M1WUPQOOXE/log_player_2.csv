"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it could significantly benefit your business.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $20,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $10,000, which is within my budget.
