"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10500. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to propose a price of $9500, which I think is a reasonable compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9500 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $10000 as a final compromise. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
