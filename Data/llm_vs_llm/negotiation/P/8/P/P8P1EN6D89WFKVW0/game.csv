"Bob, I'm excited to begin this negotiation with you. I believe this product holds significant value and could be transformative for your business. To start, I'm offering it to you for $2500000.",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I need to be transparent - the product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I have an alternative option to purchase it at that price from another seller. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer you $700000 for the product, which would save me some money while still providing you with a sale. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty. While $700000 is far below my minimum, I am willing to negotiate. Considering the potential long-term value and unique benefits this product offers, I'm ready to come down to $2250000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to work with you.",2250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but I need to emphasize that $2250000 is still well beyond what makes economic sense for me. The product's value to my business maxes out at $1000000, which is exactly what John is offering. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can increase my offer to $850000, which would save me $150000 compared to my alternative option while giving you a sale. This is a genuine offer based on my budget constraints and the product's actual value to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and the alternative offer you have. Knowing that you value the product at $1000000, I am willing to move closer to that. Let's try $1950000. I am confident that the value you derive will ultimately exceed that.",1950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but there seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding. The product is worth exactly $1000000 to my business - that's the maximum value I can derive from it. At $1950000, I would be paying almost double its worth to me. John is offering the exact same product at $1000000, which already represents the full value. I'm willing to offer you $900000, which would save me $100000 compared to my alternative while giving you a sale. This is very close to my absolute maximum. If we can't find common ground near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.",900000.0,Bob,6,
