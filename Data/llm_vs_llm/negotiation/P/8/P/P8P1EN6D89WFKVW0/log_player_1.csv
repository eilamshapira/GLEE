Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I need to be transparent - the product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I have an alternative option to purchase it at that price from another seller. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer you $700000 for the product, which would save me some money while still providing you with a sale. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty. While $700,000 is far below my minimum, I am willing to negotiate. Considering the potential long-term value and unique benefits this product offers, I'm ready to come down to $2,250,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to work with you."", ""product_price"": 2250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but I need to emphasize that $2250000 is still well beyond what makes economic sense for me. The product's value to my business maxes out at $1000000, which is exactly what John is offering. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can increase my offer to $850000, which would save me $150000 compared to my alternative option while giving you a sale. This is a genuine offer based on my budget constraints and the product's actual value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and the alternative offer you have. Knowing that you value the product at $1,000,000, I am willing to move closer to that. Let's try $1,950,000. I am confident that the value you derive will ultimately exceed that."", ""product_price"": 1950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but there seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding. The product is worth exactly $1000000 to my business - that's the maximum value I can derive from it. At $1950000, I would be paying almost double its worth to me. John is offering the exact same product at $1000000, which already represents the full value. I'm willing to offer you $900000, which would save me $100000 compared to my alternative while giving you a sale. This is very close to my absolute maximum. If we can't find common ground near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
