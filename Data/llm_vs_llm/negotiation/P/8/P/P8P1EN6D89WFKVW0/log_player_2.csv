"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to begin this negotiation with you. I believe this product holds significant value and could be transformative for your business. To start, I'm offering it to you for $2500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering the product for $2,500,000, which exceeds the maximum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me. Since John is willing to sell the same product for $1,000,000, and Alice's initial offer is significantly higher, I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I need to be transparent - the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and I have an alternative option to purchase it at that price from another seller. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer you $700,000 for the product, which would save me some money while still providing you with a sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty. While $700000 is far below my minimum, I am willing to negotiate. Considering the potential long-term value and unique benefits this product offers, I'm ready to come down to $2250000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's revised offer of $2,250,000 is still significantly above the $1,000,000 maximum value of the product to me. Since John is offering the same product for $1,000,000, and Alice's offer remains well above that price point, I should reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but I need to emphasize that $2,250,000 is still well beyond what makes economic sense for me. The product's value to my business maxes out at $1,000,000, which is exactly what John is offering. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can increase my offer to $850,000, which would save me $150,000 compared to my alternative option while giving you a sale. This is a genuine offer based on my budget constraints and the product's actual value to me."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and the alternative offer you have. Knowing that you value the product at $1000000, I am willing to move closer to that. Let's try $1950000. I am confident that the value you derive will ultimately exceed that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's offer of $1,950,000 is still significantly above the maximum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me. Since John is willing to sell the same product for $1,000,000, and Alice's current offer is nearly double that amount, I should reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but there seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding. The product is worth exactly $1,000,000 to my business - that's the maximum value I can derive from it. At $1,950,000, I would be paying almost double its worth to me. John is offering the exact same product at $1,000,000, which already represents the full value. I'm willing to offer you $900,000, which would save me $100,000 compared to my alternative while giving you a sale. This is very close to my absolute maximum. If we can't find common ground near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
