Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to provide an offer to Bob for my product. Given that the product is worth $8,000 to both Bob and myself, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, there's no incentive for me to sell to Bob for less than $8,000.

Since Bob values the product at exactly $8,000, I should offer it to him at that price. If he accepts, I get $8,000. If he rejects, I still get $8,000 from John. There's no advantage in offering a higher price since Bob won't pay more than the product's value to him.
