"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offer is $115
2. My maximum value for the product is $120
3. John's fixed price is $120
4. The product is worth $100 to Alice, so she has room to go lower

Alice's offer of $115 is better than John's price of $120, but since I know the product is worth $100 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $100 to Alice and she offered $115, I'll try to meet somewhere in the middle. I'll offer $105, which gives Alice a $5 profit but saves me $10 compared to her initial offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has lowered her price from $115 to $110
2. She rejected my offer of $105
3. The gap between our last positions is now only $5 ($110 vs $105)
4. This offer is still $10 better than John's price of $120

Since Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by dropping her price, and $110 is a reasonable price (it's $10 less than my maximum value and $10 better than John's price), I'll accept this offer. Further negotiation might risk losing this deal, and the potential savings from additional negotiation rounds would be minimal.
