Hello Bob! I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. I believe it would be a great value at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?,180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to consider this price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $90 is too low for the quality I'm offering. I could come down to $150, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value. Would this work better for you?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $150. However, it's still a bit above what I'm willing to pay. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current one. Would you be willing to sell the product for $120?",120.0,Bob,4,
