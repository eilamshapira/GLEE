"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. I believe it would be a great value at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll send a counteroffer since $90 is below my minimum acceptable price ($100), and I believe we can negotiate to a better price. Bob has shown interest in the product, so there's room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $90 is too low for the quality I'm offering. I could come down to $150, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value. Would this work better for you?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $150. However, it's still a bit above what I'm willing to pay. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current one. Would you be willing to sell the product for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $120. This is a reasonable compromise that's above my minimum acceptable price of $100, and it's better than selling to John for $100. Bob has shown good faith in negotiating by making a significant increase from his initial offer, and this price represents a fair middle ground."
