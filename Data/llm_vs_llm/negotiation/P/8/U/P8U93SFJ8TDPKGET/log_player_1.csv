"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product. Considering its value and unique features, I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that the product has value, but I think $18000 is too high. I'm willing to pay $6000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough situation! Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me, and even lower than what I can get from John. I need to try and get a better price.

Therefore, my decision is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but I can't go that low. Considering the product's value, the lowest I can accept is $16,000."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16000 is still too high for me. I can offer $7000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is getting frustrating. Bob is still offering a very low price. I could cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000, but I'm going to try one more time to see if I can get a better deal.

Therefore, my decision is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I can't go much lower. How about we meet in the middle? I'll offer it to you for $14,000."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're making an effort to meet me in the middle, but $14000 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. I can offer $8000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is really lowballing me. I'm starting to think I won't get a much better offer from him. I can sell to John for $10,000 right now, which is better than what Bob is offering. I also have another 4 rounds to close the deal with Bob. However, the risk is that Bob will lower his offer even more. I think it's time to move on.

Therefore, my decision is:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
