"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I should analyze this offer carefully.

Alice is offering the product for $15,000, but the product is only worth $10,000 to me. Additionally, I have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $10,000.

Since Alice's current offer ($15,000) exceeds both the product's value to me and John's price, I should not accept it. I have two remaining options:
1) Make a counteroffer to Alice
2) Buy from John immediately

Since I can always buy from John later if negotiations with Alice fail, and there's potential to get a better price from Alice, I should reject the offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice:

{""product_price"": $8,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has lowered her price from $15,000 to $13,500, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this offer is still higher than John's price of $10,000, and the product is only worth $10,000 to me.

Since I can buy the product from John for $10,000, there's no reason to accept an offer that's higher than that amount. I should continue negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a better price than John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer slightly to show I'm negotiating in good faith, but I'll stay well below John's price:

{""product_price"": $9,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I notice Alice is continuing to lower her price, now to $12,500. While this shows she's willing to negotiate further, her current offer is still $2,500 higher than John's price of $10,000.

Since I can buy the product from John for $10,000, and the product is only worth $10,000 to me, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $12,500. I should either continue negotiating with Alice or buy from John.

Given that Alice has been reducing her price by about $1,500 each round, it seems likely she'll continue to lower her price, potentially below John's $10,000 offer. Therefore, I'll reject and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make one more counteroffer, slightly higher than my previous one but still below John's price:

{""product_price"": $9,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $12,000, which shows she's continuing to negotiate, but her price is still $2,000 higher than John's price of $10,000.

Since I can buy the product from John for $10,000, and the product is only worth $10,000 to me, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer that exceeds this amount.

Alice has been consistently lowering her price, but at a decreasing rate (from $1,500 reductions to now just $500). At this pace, it might take several more rounds before she potentially offers something below $10,000, if at all.

Given that I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $10,000, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me, the rational decision is to take that option now.
