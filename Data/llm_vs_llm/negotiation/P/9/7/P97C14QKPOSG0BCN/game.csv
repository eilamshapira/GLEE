"Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product sounds interesting, your asking price is quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800000 is significantly below the product's value. Given the quality and features of this product, I cannot go below $1900000. This is already a substantial reduction from my initial offer.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need to be realistic about my budget.  I could stretch to $1100000, but that's really my limit.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
