Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be of great value to you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,300,000. This is a competitive price for what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 2300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product sounds interesting, your asking price is quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer. $800,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and I know I can get that amount from John. However, I'd like to continue negotiating with Bob to try to get a better price.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's value. Given the quality and features of this product, I cannot go below $1,900,000. This is already a substantial reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need to be realistic about my budget.  I could stretch to $1100000, but that's really my limit.

I'll sell to John for $1,500,000. Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and since he stated this is his limit, it's unlikely he'll go much higher. The guaranteed $1,500,000 from John is the better choice here, as it's $400,000 more than Bob's current offer."
