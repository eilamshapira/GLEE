"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for $130. It's a fantastic deal for its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice is offering the product for $130, which is more expensive than John's price of $100, and also above my maximum value of $100, it makes no sense to accept this offer. I can either negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, or simply buy from John for $100. Since John's price matches my maximum value and is already lower than Alice's offer, the most rational decision would be to buy from John.
