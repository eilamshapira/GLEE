"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $130, which I think is a fair price given its quality and value.",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks Alice, but I think $130 is a bit high. I'm looking to spend no more than $100 on this product. How about I offer you $90 instead?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $90 is too low considering the value this product provides. I can come down from my initial price to $115, which I believe is a fair compromise given that this product is worth $150 to you.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about we settle for $95? This way, we both benefit from the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're making progress, but I still think we can find a better middle ground. Given that the product is worth $150 to you, I'm willing to lower my price to $105. This gives you a significant $45 in value while still being fair to both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"We're definitely making progress, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. How about we split the difference and settle for $100? This way, we both walk away feeling good about the deal.",100.0,Bob,6,
