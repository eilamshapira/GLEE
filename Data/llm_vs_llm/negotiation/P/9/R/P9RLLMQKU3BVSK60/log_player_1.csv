"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $130, which I think is a fair price given its quality and value."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice, but I think $130 is a bit high. I'm looking to spend no more than $100 on this product. How about I offer you $90 instead? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. The current offer of $90 is too close to my minimum acceptable price of $80, and I know the product is worth $150 to Bob. There's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $90 is too low considering the value this product provides. I can come down from my initial price to $115, which I believe is a fair compromise given that this product is worth $150 to you."", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about we settle for $95? This way, we both benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make another counteroffer. Bob has increased his offer from $90 to $95, showing some flexibility. Since he knows the product is worth $150 to him, there's still room to negotiate a better price that's more beneficial for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're making progress, but I still think we can find a better middle ground. Given that the product is worth $150 to you, I'm willing to lower my price to $105. This gives you a significant $45 in value while still being fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're definitely making progress, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. How about we split the difference and settle for $100? This way, we both walk away feeling good about the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $100. This is a reasonable compromise as it's significantly better than my alternative option of selling to John for $80, and we've reached a fair middle ground after several rounds of negotiation. While Bob will still get good value (as it's worth $150 to him), I'm also getting a decent profit margin above my minimum price of $80."
