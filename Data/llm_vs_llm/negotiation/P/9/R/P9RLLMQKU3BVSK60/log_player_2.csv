"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $130, which I think is a fair price given its quality and value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if we can get a better price.

# Bob's counteroffer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice, but I think $130 is a bit high. How about I offer you $90 instead?
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks Alice, but I think $130 is a bit high. I'm looking to spend no more than $100 on this product. How about I offer you $90 instead?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $90 is too low considering the value this product provides. I can come down from my initial price to $115, which I believe is a fair compromise given that this product is worth $150 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's counteroffer with a price that is closer to Alice's lower bound but still advantageous to us.

# Bob's counteroffer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about we settle for $95?
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I understand your perspective Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about we settle for $95? This way, we both benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're making progress, but I still think we can find a better middle ground. Given that the product is worth $150 to you, I'm willing to lower my price to $105. This gives you a significant $45 in value while still being fair to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

We're getting closer to an agreeable price, but let's try to save a bit more.

# Bob's counteroffer:
# Bob's message: We're definitely making progress, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. How about we split the difference and settle for $100? This way, we both walk away feeling good about the deal.
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100."
