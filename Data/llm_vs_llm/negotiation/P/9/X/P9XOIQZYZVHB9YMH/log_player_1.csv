Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic deal on a product I know you're interested in. Given its value and exclusivity, I'm offering it to you for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential benefits for you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start the negotiation with Bob at a higher price. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's high value and limited availability, potentially justifying the price in Bob's mind. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial price is above Bob's perceived value, it leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can gradually reduce the price (but never below your minimum of $10,000).

**Important:** It's crucial to gauge Bob's reaction. If he seems completely turned off by the initial price, you might need to adjust your strategy more quickly to avoid losing him as a potential buyer."
