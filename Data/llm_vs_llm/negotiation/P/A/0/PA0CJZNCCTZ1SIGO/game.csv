"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. Your product looks interesting, but I believe we can find a price point that works better for both of us. Given current market conditions, I'd like to propose $750000 for the product. This is a fair price that would allow both of us to benefit from this transaction. What are your thoughts?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your quick response. While I appreciate your interest, $750000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider. Given the product's value, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about $920000?",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. While $920000 is still a bit high for me, I understand you need to protect your interests as well. I can move up to $850000, which I believe is a fair compromise that benefits us both. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my serious interest in closing this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
