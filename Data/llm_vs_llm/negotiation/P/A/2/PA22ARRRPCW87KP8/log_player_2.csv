"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice is offering the product for $150, which is the maximum value I'm willing to pay for it. Since John is also willing to sell it for $150, there's no advantage to buying from Alice at this price.

I should try to negotiate with Alice for a better price, as I want to save as much money as possible.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Since I can get the same product from John for $150, I'd need a better price to make a deal with you. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I really want to make this deal happen. How about $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has countered with $120, which is $30 less than what I would pay from John. This is a good offer since it's significantly below my maximum valuation, but I could try to get an even better deal.
