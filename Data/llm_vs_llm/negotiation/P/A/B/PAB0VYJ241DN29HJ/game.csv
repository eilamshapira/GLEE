"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that the product is worth $12000 to you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a price that's closer to its true value. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I still need to get a fair price for it.

"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $11000. I'm willing to make a concession, but I need to get at least $14000 for it. Considering you mentioned the product is worth $12000 to you, I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Let's try to meet in the middle of my desired price and your maximum willingness to pay.",14000.0,Alice,5,
