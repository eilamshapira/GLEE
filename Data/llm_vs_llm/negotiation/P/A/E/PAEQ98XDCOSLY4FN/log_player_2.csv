Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $500000 is significantly below the product's worth and my minimum acceptable price. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1400000? This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a genuine attempt to meet you halfway. I am also considering another offer for $1200000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to stretch your budget. However, $600000 is still far from acceptable. As I mentioned, I have another offer for $1200000.
