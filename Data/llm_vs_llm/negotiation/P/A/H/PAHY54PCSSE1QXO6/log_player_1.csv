Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make an offer that is advantageous to me while still being potentially acceptable to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me and I have a guaranteed backup buyer at that price, I should offer Bob a price higher than that to maximize my potential profit.

I'll set a price that gives me a good premium over my minimum acceptable value, but not so high that Bob would immediately reject it.
