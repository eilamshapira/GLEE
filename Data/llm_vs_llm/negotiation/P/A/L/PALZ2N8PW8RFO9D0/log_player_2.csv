You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and John is offering it for exactly $100, Alice's offer of $150 is clearly not a good deal. I would be paying $50 more than the product is worth to me.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has reduced her price from $150 to $120, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still $20 more than John's price of $100, and the product is only worth up to $100 to me. There's no reason for me to pay more than the product's value to me, especially when I have a guaranteed option to buy it at $100.
