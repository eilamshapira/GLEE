"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2300000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, the price of $2300000 is above my budget. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I can only consider a price that is significantly lower. I'd like to propose a price of $900000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider the initial offer and providing your perspective on the value. While $900000 is quite a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually agreeable price. To move us closer, I'd be willing to come down to $1900000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of this product and its potential for you.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for revising your offer to $1900000. I appreciate your willingness to work together to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $1900000 is still above my budget. I'd like to propose a compromise at $1050000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and potential.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're still apart on price, but I'm encouraged that you see the value in this product. Your proposed compromise is closer to a range I could work with.  How about we meet halfway between your offer and my previous price, setting it at $1475000? I believe this is a fair reflection of the product's worth and our mutual desire to reach an agreement.",1475000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your suggestion to meet halfway between our previous offers. However, $1475000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering our previous discussions, I'd like to propose a price of $1200000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If this isn't acceptable, I may need to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
