Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 800000}

I chose this price because:
1. It's exactly what the product is worth to Bob
2. While I could make more money ($1,500,000) by selling to John, I understand that by offering the product at Bob's maximum value, there's a chance he might accept
3. If Bob rejects this offer (which is likely since it provides him no surplus value), I still have the guaranteed backup option of selling to John for $1,500,000
4. There's no incentive for me to offer less than $800,000 since that would mean leaving money on the table if Bob accepts"
