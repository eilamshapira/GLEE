"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $120 is quite high for this product. Based on my market research and the product's features, I would be willing to pay $65 for it. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us.",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your market research, but I believe the product's value is higher than $65. Considering its quality and demand, I'm willing to lower my initial price to $110. This is the lowest I'm comfortable with at this point.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $110 is still quite high for this product. I can increase my offer to $75, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the product's fair market value. This would be a win-win for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $75. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I can lower the price to $92.50.",92.5,Alice,5,
