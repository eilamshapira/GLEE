Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer is equal to John's guaranteed offer and it's also my minimum acceptable price, there's no advantage in accepting Bob's offer over selling to John. However, I believe I can get a better price from Bob, so I'll reject and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price significantly from my initial offer but still maintain a good margin above my minimum price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $12,000 is better than John's guaranteed $10,000, and while we might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk Bob might withdraw or lower his offer. This is a reasonable profit margin above my minimum price, so I'll accept.
