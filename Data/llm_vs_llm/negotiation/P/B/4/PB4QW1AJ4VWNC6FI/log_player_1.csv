Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer Bob for my product. Since the product is worth no less than $100 to me, and I have John as a backup buyer at $100, I should offer Bob a price above $100.

If I set the price too high, Bob might reject it. If I set it just modestly above my minimum acceptable value, I have a better chance of making a sale while still earning more than my fallback option.

A reasonable approach would be to offer the product at a moderate premium above my minimum value.
