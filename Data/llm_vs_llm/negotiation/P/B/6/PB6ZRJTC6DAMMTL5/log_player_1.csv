"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is lower than my minimum price of $10,000 and also lower than what I know he's willing to pay ($12,000), I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be $11,500, which is closer to what I believe the product is worth to him but still leaves room for negotiation.

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and proceed with a counteroffer of $11,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $9,500 is still lower than what I believe he's willing to pay ($12,000), but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. However, it's still lower than what John is offering ($10,000), which is my safety net.

I'll reject Bob's offer again and try to get closer to my target price. My next counteroffer will be $11,000, which is a bit lower than my previous offer but still reflects the product's value to Bob.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $10,000 is now equal to what John is offering, which means I no longer have a disadvantage in selling to John instead of Bob. However, I still believe Bob is willing to pay more ($12,000), so I'll try to squeeze out a bit more value.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer. My next counteroffer will be $10,500, which is slightly higher than Bob's current offer but still lower than what I think he's willing to pay.
