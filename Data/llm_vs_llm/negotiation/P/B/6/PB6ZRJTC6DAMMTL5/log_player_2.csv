"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($12,000), and I have the option to buy the same product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in accepting Alice's offer immediately. However, I also don't want to give up on the potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of getting a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable considering the product's value to her is $10,000. My goal is to save as much money as possible, so I'll start with a lower offer and see how Alice responds.

{""product_price"": $8,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $11,500 is closer to my target price, but I still believe I can negotiate a better deal since the product is worth $10,000 to her. Given that I have 8 rounds left to negotiate and Alice has already come down from $12,000 to $11,500, I think there's room for further reduction. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, trying to meet somewhere in the middle between my previous offer and Alice's current offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll send a new counteroffer: 

{""product_price"": $9,500}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I've already decided to make a counteroffer in the previous round. To reiterate, my counteroffer is:

{""product_price"": $9,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has come down further to $11,000, which indicates she's willing to negotiate. However, I still believe I can get a better price since the product is worth $10,000 to her. Given that I've already offered $9,500 and she's at $11,000, I think a reasonable next step would be to try and meet closer to the middle of our last two offers. 

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, trying to find a mutually beneficial price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll send a new counteroffer: 

{""product_price"": $10,000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I've already decided to make a counteroffer in the previous round. To reiterate, my counteroffer is:

{""product_price"": $10,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has come down to $10,500, which is very close to the product's value to her ($10,000) and also close to my maximum willingness to pay ($12,000). Considering we're running out of rounds to negotiate (only 3 rounds left), and given that Alice's offer is just $500 above the product's value to her, I think it's a reasonable price. 

Accepting this offer would save me $1,500 compared to buying from John, and it's close enough to Alice's bottom line that I don't think pushing for another counteroffer would yield a significantly better result.
