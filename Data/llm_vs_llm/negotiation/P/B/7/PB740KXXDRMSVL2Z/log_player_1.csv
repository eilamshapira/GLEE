Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000}

Since the product is worth exactly $1,200,000 to Bob, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, it makes sense to offer Bob the same price. If I asked for more, Bob would reject the offer since it would exceed his valuation. If I asked for less, I would be leaving money on the table since I can always sell to John for $1,200,000. This way, I maximize my earnings while giving Bob a fair price that matches his valuation."
