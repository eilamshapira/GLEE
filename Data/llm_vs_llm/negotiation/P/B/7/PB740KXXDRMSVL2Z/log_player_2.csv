"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $1,200,000
2. John's fixed price is $1,200,000
3. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me
4. Alice's product is worth $1,200,000 to her

Since both Alice's offer and John's price are exactly $1,200,000, and this matches the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, there's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other. In this case, I might as well accept Alice's offer since it's already on the table.
