"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering you this fantastic product for $200. I believe it's a great deal for you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll analyze my options:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $200
2. Reject and make a counteroffer
3. Buy from John for $150

Alice is offering the product for $200, which is $50 more than my maximum value ($150) and $50 more than John's price. There's no reason for me to accept this offer since I can get the same product from John at a better price that matches my maximum value.

While I could reject and make a counteroffer, I already know I can get the product for $150 from John, which is my maximum value anyway. There's no need to negotiate further when I can immediately get the best possible outcome for me.
