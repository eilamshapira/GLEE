,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand $200 might be too high for your budget. However, this is a valuable product, and $100 is the absolute minimum I can accept. I can offer it to you for $150, which I believe is a fair price considering its quality. Would you be interested in this price?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $125 for the product. It's a fair price considering it's less than your minimum and more than my budget.",125.0,Bob,4,
