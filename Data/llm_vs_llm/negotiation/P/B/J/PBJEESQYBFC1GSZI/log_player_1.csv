Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. I'm selling it for $200. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob offered $100, which is exactly the same as John's guaranteed offer, I'll try one more time to negotiate a better price with Bob before considering selling to John.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round with a lower price than my initial $200, but still above $100, to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand $200 might be too high for your budget. However, this is a valuable product, and $100 is the absolute minimum I can accept. I can offer it to you for $150, which I believe is a fair price considering its quality. Would you be interested in this price?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $125 for the product. It's a fair price considering it's less than your minimum and more than my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $125. This is a good outcome because:
1. It's $25 more than John's guaranteed offer of $100
2. Bob has moved up significantly from his initial offer of $100
3. While it's less than my initial asking price, it's still a reasonable compromise
4. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob as a buyer, and we might end up at a lower price or having to sell to John for $100"
