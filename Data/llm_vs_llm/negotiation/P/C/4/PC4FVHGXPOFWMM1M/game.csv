"Hello Bob, I have a product that I'm selling. This product is of high quality and has a market value of $1500000. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1450000, which represents good value considering its worth. Are you interested in purchasing at this price?",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1450000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Considering the market value, I'd be willing to pay $1250000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with that price.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $1250000. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but that's closer to my absolute minimum than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I've had significant interest in this product, and its true market value is substantial. I can come down to $1375000, which represents a $75000 reduction from my initial offer. This is still a competitive price considering the product's value. Would you be able to meet me at this price?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1375000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1250000.  It's a fair price, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I understand your position, I need to be transparent that $1250000 is very close to my absolute bottom line. I have another buyer, John, who is prepared to purchase at $1200000, so I can't go much lower than my current position. Meeting in the middle would be fair for both of us. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1325000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This represents good value for a product of this caliber. Can we agree on this price to close the deal?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise.  However, $1325000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $1250000.  I'm confident that's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be firm on this. You've maintained your position at $1250000 while I've made multiple concessions from my initial offer. I have John ready to purchase at $1200000, which is just $50000 less than your offer. Given that I'm looking for the best deal possible, I need to see some movement from your side. My final offer is $1290000 - this is as low as I can reasonably go and still justify not selling to John. This represents a significant $160000 reduction from my initial offer. I hope we can conclude our deal at this price, otherwise I may need to pursue other options.",1290000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your position, but $1290000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $1250000.  This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to accept it, then I'll have to move on to other options.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
