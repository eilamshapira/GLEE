Round 2
Bob's offer:

I understand you're looking for a good deal, but that's closer to my absolute minimum than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I've had significant interest in this product, and its true market value is substantial. I can come down to $1,375,000, which represents a $75,000 reduction from my initial offer. This is still a competitive price considering the product's value. Would you be able to meet me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 1375000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1375000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1250000.  It's a fair price, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I understand your position, I need to be transparent that $1,250,000 is very close to my absolute bottom line. I have another buyer, John, who is prepared to purchase at $1,200,000, so I can't go much lower than my current position. Meeting in the middle would be fair for both of us. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,325,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This represents good value for a product of this caliber. Can we agree on this price to close the deal?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}"

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be firm on this. You've maintained your position at $1,250,000 while I've made multiple concessions from my initial offer. I have John ready to purchase at $1,200,000, which is just $50,000 less than your offer. Given that I'm looking for the best deal possible, I need to see some movement from your side. My final offer is $1,290,000 - this is as low as I can reasonably go and still justify not selling to John. This represents a significant $160,000 reduction from my initial offer. I hope we can conclude our deal at this price, otherwise I may need to pursue other options."", ""product_price"": 1290000}"
