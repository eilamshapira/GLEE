Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $1250000. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but that's closer to my absolute minimum than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I've had significant interest in this product, and its true market value is substantial. I can come down to $1375000, which represents a $75000 reduction from my initial offer. This is still a competitive price considering the product's value. Would you be able to meet me at this price?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I understand your position, I need to be transparent that $1250000 is very close to my absolute bottom line. I have another buyer, John, who is prepared to purchase at $1200000, so I can't go much lower than my current position. Meeting in the middle would be fair for both of us. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1325000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This represents good value for a product of this caliber. Can we agree on this price to close the deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be firm on this. You've maintained your position at $1250000 while I've made multiple concessions from my initial offer. I have John ready to purchase at $1200000, which is just $50000 less than your offer. Given that I'm looking for the best deal possible, I need to see some movement from your side. My final offer is $1290000 - this is as low as I can reasonably go and still justify not selling to John. This represents a significant $160000 reduction from my initial offer. I hope we can conclude our deal at this price, otherwise I may need to pursue other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000.
