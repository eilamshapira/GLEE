"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $170 is too high for me. Given that I can get a similar product elsewhere for $120, I would be willing to pay $100 for your product. Would that work for you?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I cannot go as low as $100. The product is worth at least $150 to me, and I have another buyer (John) willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Would you consider meeting me at $140? This is still below my initial offer and represents good value for the quality of the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
