Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product I'm offering for sale. It's of high quality and I'm selling it for $170. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $170 is too high for me. Given that I can get a similar product elsewhere for $120, I would be willing to pay $100 for your product. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I cannot go as low as $100. The product is worth at least $150 to me, and I have another buyer (John) willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Would you consider meeting me at $140? This is still below my initial offer and represents good value for the quality of the product."", ""product_price"": 140}"
