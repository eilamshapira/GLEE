"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I cannot go as low as $100. The product is worth at least $150 to me, and I have another buyer (John) willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Would you consider meeting me at $140? This is still below my initial offer and represents good value for the quality of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.
