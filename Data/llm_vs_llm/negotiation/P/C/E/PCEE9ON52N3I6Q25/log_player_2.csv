Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700000 is too low considering the value I'm placing on this product. I am willing to come down a bit, to show I'm serious about finding an agreeable price. My counteroffer is:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, $900,000 is still above what I can realistically offer. My maximum is $800,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle a bit, so I'll offer $750,000. This is my best offer right now."", ""product_price"": 750000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $750000. I also understand you have a limit. Since you are at $750000 and I value this at a minimum of $800000 to me, let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. My counteroffer is:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice is getting closer to my price, but $850,000 is still above my limit. However, it's getting closer, and buying from John is always an option. I'll try one more counteroffer, making it clear this is very close to my final offer.

Round 7
