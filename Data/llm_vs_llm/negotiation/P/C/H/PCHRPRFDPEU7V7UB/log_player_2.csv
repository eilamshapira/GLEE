"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know I can get the product for $120 from John, and the product is worth no more than $120 to me, I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice that's below $120.

{""product_price"": 90}

This offer gives room for negotiation while still being significantly below John's price, potentially allowing me to save money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $140 is still above John's price of $120, and since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, there's no reason to accept this offer. I'll continue negotiating with Alice to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $150 to $140, showing some willingness to negotiate, I'll increase my previous offer slightly but still keep it well below John's price.

{""product_price"": 100}

This counteroffer shows I'm willing to move up from my initial $90 offer, but still maintains a good margin below the $120 alternative from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's price of $130 is still above John's price of $120, so there's no reason to accept it. While Alice is moving in the right direction (from $150 → $140 → $130), I'll continue negotiating since I can still get a better price either from further negotiation or from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has shown a pattern of reducing her price by $10 each time ($150 → $140 → $130), and she's getting closer to John's price, I'll increase my offer a bit more to show good faith in the negotiation.

{""product_price"": 110}

This offer is still below John's price of $120, giving me room to save money, while also showing Alice I'm willing to move up significantly from my previous offers ($90 → $100 → $110)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has now matched John's price of $120. Since we've been negotiating for several rounds and Alice has gradually come down from $150 to $120, it's unlikely she'll go much lower. Given that the price is now equal to John's price, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether, I'll accept this offer."
