"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be perfect for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Looking at the situation:

1. The product is worth at most $10,000 to you.
2. Alice is offering the product for $12,000.
3. John will sell you the same product for $10,000.

Since Alice's offer ($12,000) exceeds both the product's value to you and John's price, the rational choice is to buy from John.
