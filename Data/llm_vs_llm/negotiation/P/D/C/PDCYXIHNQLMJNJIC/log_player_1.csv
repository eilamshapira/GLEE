Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this:
1. The product is worth $150 minimum to me
2. It's worth $120 to Bob
3. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $150

Since I can always sell to John for $150, there's no reason for me to sell to Bob for less than that. I'll start with a price above $150 to leave room for negotiation, but not too high to completely discourage Bob.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below my minimum value of $150
2. It's also well below what the product is worth to Bob ($120)
3. I have a guaranteed offer from John at $150

Bob's offer of $80 is clearly not acceptable as it's far below both my minimum value and even Bob's own valuation. While I could make a counteroffer, given that:
- The product is worth only $120 to Bob
- I can get $150 from John
- There's no way Bob would pay more than his valuation of $120

It makes the most economic sense to take the guaranteed $150 from John rather than continue negotiating with Bob.
