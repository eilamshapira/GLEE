"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice's offer is too high. It's significantly more than John's offer.  We should try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 1000000 
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're starting with a strong counter-offer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still provides room for negotiation. This approach aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** A low counter-offer will reveal how willing Alice is to move on price. 
* **Establish a negotiation range:** By starting low, we're aiming to bring the final price closer to our desired range (well below John's $1,500,000 offer).
* **Avoid exceeding our budget:** We want to ensure that we don't accidentally agree to a price that's higher than what John is offering.

Let's see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While Alice moved down a bit, the price is still significantly higher than John's offer. We have room to negotiate further and see if we can get closer to our target price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We are increasing our offer slightly to show Alice we are willing to negotiate, but we are still aiming for a price significantly lower than her last offer and below John's offer. This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Demonstrate willingness to compromise:** We are not simply sticking to our initial low offer.
* **Maintain a downward pressure on the price:** The increase is relatively small, keeping the momentum towards a more favorable deal for us.
* **Stay within a reasonable range of John's offer:** We don't want to get too far from our backup option.

Let's see how Alice responds."
