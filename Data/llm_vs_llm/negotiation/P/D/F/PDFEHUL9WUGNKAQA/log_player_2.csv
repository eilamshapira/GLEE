"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll analyze Alice's offer:
- Alice is offering the product for $12,000
- The product is worth at most $15,000 to me
- John is selling the same product for $15,000
- I have 10 rounds to negotiate

Alice's offer of $12,000 is $3,000 less than John's price, so it's already a better deal. However, I should try to negotiate for an even better price since Alice's cost is only $8,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice. Since the product costs her $8,000 and she's offering it at $12,000, I'll aim for a price that still gives her a profit but saves me more money.

{""product_price"": $9,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll analyze Alice's new offer:
- Alice has reduced her price from $12,000 to $11,000
- This is a $4,000 savings compared to John's price of $15,000
- We've made progress in the negotiation, but there may still be room for improvement
- We have plenty of rounds left (7 more after this one)
- The product costs Alice $8,000, so she still has a $3,000 profit margin

Since Alice dropped her price by $1,000, there's a good chance we can negotiate further. Let me reject and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice dropped her price by $1,000 (from $12,000 to $11,000), I'll also adjust my counteroffer upward from my initial $9,500. I'll aim for a price that splits the difference between her cost ($8,000) and her current offer ($11,000) more favorably for me while still giving her a reasonable profit.
