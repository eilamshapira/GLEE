"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Considering the options:

*   **Accepting Alice's offer:** This costs $950,000.
*   **Buying from John:** This costs $1,000,000.
*   **Rejecting and counteroffering:** This gives a chance to negotiate a lower price but risks losing the deal altogether if Alice doesn't accept any counteroffer in the next 9 rounds.

Since $950,000 is less than $1,000,000, and there are still 9 rounds left, it's worthwhile to reject the offer and try for a better price.

**{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given the product is worth $800,000 to Alice and $1,000,000 to me, I'll start by offering a price that still allows for a decent profit for Alice, but also saves me money.

**{""product_price"": 900000}**"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Analyzing the situation:

*   **Accepting Alice's Offer:** Costs $925,000.
*   **Buying from John:** Costs $1,000,000.
*   **Rejecting and counteroffering:** Still an option, but the price is inching up, and the rounds are dwindling.

The price has gone up from the initial offer, and I now have fewer rounds. Since the price is still less than what John offers and I want to try for a lower price, I'll reject and offer a lower price.

**{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I want to be closer to my ideal price without being too far from Alice's, and the rounds are running out. I'll offer a price slightly higher than my previous offer, but still lower than the current offer, and hope to close the deal.

**{""product_price"": 910000}**"
