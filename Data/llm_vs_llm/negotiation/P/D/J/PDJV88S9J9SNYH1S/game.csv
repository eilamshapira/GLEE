"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value and rarity of the product, my budget is quite limited. I can offer $7000 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $7000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and my initial price, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer the product to you for $18000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in, or if you'd like to make another counteroffer.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for considering my previous offer, Alice. Given my budget constraints, I'm willing to improve my offer to $8500 for the product. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for improving your offer. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I still feel that $8500 is below the product's value. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $16000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's quality and potential benefits. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in, or if you'd like to make another counteroffer.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your efforts to reach a mutually agreeable price. However, I still believe that $9500 is below the product's value. Considering the progress we've made so far, I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $14500. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's quality and potential benefits. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in, or if you'd like to make another counteroffer.",14500.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget to $10000. However, I still believe that the product's value is higher than that. Considering we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, I'm willing to make a final compromise and offer the product to you for $13000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's quality and potential benefits. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,9,
