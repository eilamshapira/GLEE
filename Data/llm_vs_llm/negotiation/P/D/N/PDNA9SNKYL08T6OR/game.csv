"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I believe the price of $1200000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value to my business.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget considerations, I must emphasize that the product's value is actually $1000000 at minimum to me. I already have another buyer, John, willing to purchase at that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can reduce my asking price to $1050000, which is just slightly above what I could get elsewhere. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and demonstrates my willingness to establish a business relationship with you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for sharing the information about the other buyer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. Considering your minimum value of $1000000 and my own budget constraints, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000, meeting you at the minimum value you mentioned. I believe this is a fair price for both parties and would be happy to finalize the deal at this amount.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
