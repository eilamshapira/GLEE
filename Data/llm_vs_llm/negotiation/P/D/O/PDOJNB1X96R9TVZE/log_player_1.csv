"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair price."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $60 because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'd like to make a counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle. My next offer will be lower than $120 but still higher than $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and find a middle ground. Let's try to meet somewhere in between."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer, hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $70 because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. Although we're getting closer, I believe the product is worth more, and I'd like to try to find a price that works for both of us. My next counteroffer will be slightly lower than $100, trying to meet Bob halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm trying to be flexible, but I still need to get a fair price for the product. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for continuing to negotiate with me. I'm getting closer to my budget limit, but I still think we can find a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I accept Bob's offer of $80. Since this is my minimum acceptable price, and Bob has finally met it, I'm willing to close the deal with him. Additionally, selling to Bob at this price is equivalent to selling to John, but it allows me to complete the negotiation with Bob, which might be beneficial for future interactions."
