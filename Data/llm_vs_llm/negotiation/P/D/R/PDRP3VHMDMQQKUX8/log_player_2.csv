"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an opportunity to purchase this product. Based on my market research, this product is highly valuable, and I have another interested buyer, John, who is ready to purchase it for $1500000. However, I wanted to give you the first opportunity to acquire it. My offer to you is $1000000, which I believe is fair considering the product's value and potential. I look forward to your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
