"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value you see in the product, but $2500000 is above my budget. I am willing to purchase the product for $1000000, considering the market options I have.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $1000000 is too low for this product's value. I can reduce my initial price to $1750000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's quality and market value. Would you consider this revised offer?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
