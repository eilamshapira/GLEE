Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value you see in the product, but $2500000 is above my budget. I am willing to purchase the product for $1000000, considering the market options I have. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer to Bob. Since Bob's initial offer matches John's guaranteed price, but I believe there's room for negotiation given my initial price point, I'll continue the negotiation with a lower price than my first offer but still significantly above $1,000,000.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $1,000,000 is too low for this product's value.

Would you consider this revised offer?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
