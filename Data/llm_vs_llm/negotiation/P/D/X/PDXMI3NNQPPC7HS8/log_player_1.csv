"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $40. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $40
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I certainly can't sell the product for $40 when I know it's worth more than $120 to me. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 180}

I understand that we need to find a price that works for both of us. I've lowered my initial offer, and I hope this new price of $180 seems more reasonable to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob, I understand that we're trying to find a middle ground here, but $60 is still too low for me to consider. I know the product is worth more than $120 to me and I think I can still get a better price by negotiating with you. I know we are $120 apart so let's split the difference.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 150}

Bob, I've come down quite a bit from my original price. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope you see the value in this offer. It's still significantly more than what you've offered so far, but I think it's a good middle ground for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob, I've tried my best to negotiate a fair price with you, but your offers are just too low for me to accept. I know the product is worth more than $120 to me, so I think it's best for me to sell to John at this point. I wish you all the best."
