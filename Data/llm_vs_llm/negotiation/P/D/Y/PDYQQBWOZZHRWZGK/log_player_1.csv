Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit above our minimum ($1,200,000).
* **John as a Backup:** We have a safety net with John, ensuring we won't go empty-handed.

This strategy aims for a high initial offer, balancing profit maximization with the risk of Bob rejecting the deal."
