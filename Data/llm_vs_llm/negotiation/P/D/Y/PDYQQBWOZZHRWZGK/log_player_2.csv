"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1400000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to analyze this offer carefully:

- The product is worth up to $1,500,000 to me
- Alice's offer is $1,400,000
- John's offer is $1,500,000
- If I reject Alice, my only option would be to buy from John for $1,500,000

Alice's offer saves me $100,000 compared to John's offer. Since both options get me the product I need, and my goal is to save money while acquiring the product, I should accept Alice's offer.
