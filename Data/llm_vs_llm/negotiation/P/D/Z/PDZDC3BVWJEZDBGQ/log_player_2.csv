"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since the product is worth $10,000 to me and Alice's offer is $11,000, which is higher than my desired price, I will reject Alice's offer. I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll offer a price that is closer to my desired price of $10,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $9,500 is getting closer to my desired price of $10,000, but it's still $500 more than I'm willing to pay. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $10,000, I don't feel pressured to accept Alice's offer just yet.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate a better price. Maybe I can get her to come down a bit more.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $9,500, I'll try to meet her halfway between her offer and my previous counteroffer of $9,000. I'll offer $9,250, which is a small concession on my part, but still below my maximum budget of $10,000.
