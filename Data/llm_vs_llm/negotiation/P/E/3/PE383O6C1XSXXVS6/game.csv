"Hello Bob, I have a product that I'm looking to sell. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. Are you interested in purchasing at this price?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is of high quality, $15000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I can't accept $8000 as that's actually below my cost for this product. I understand $15000 might be above your budget, so I'm willing to come down to $12500. This is still a very competitive price for a product of this quality and value. Would that work for you?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate the effort.  I could potentially stretch my budget to $9500. That's a strong offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,4,
