Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I'm looking to sell. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. Are you interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I can't accept $8,000 as that's actually below my cost for this product.
