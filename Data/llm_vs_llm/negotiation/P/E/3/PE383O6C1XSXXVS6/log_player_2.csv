"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I'm looking to sell. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. Are you interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is of high quality, $15,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I can't accept $8000 as that's actually below my cost for this product. I understand $15000 might be above your budget, so I'm willing to come down to $12500. This is still a very competitive price for a product of this quality and value. Would that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate the effort.  I could potentially stretch my budget to $9,500. That's a strong offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
