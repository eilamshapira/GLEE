"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12000 is significantly above what I'm looking to spend. Given that I have another option available at $8000, I would need a much more competitive price. I can offer $7000 for the product. This would save you the hassle of finding another buyer and provide you with immediate payment.",7000.0,Bob,2,
