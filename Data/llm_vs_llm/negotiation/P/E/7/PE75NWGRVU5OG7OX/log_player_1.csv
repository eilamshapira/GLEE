Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of you purchasing this product. Given its value, I would like to offer it to you for $12,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12000 is significantly above what I'm looking to spend. Given that I have another option available at $8000, I would need a much more competitive price. I can offer $7000 for the product. This would save you the hassle of finding another buyer and provide you with immediate payment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
