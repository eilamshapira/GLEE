"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

While $100 is less than Alice's value, it's more than your $80 limit and you know John will sell it for $80. You should try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
