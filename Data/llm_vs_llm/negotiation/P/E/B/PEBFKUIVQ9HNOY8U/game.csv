"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer of $1300000 is closer to my expectations, I need to consider the true value of what I'm offering. I'm willing to meet you part way and sell the product for $1650000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial price while still reflecting the premium quality and value of the product. Would this work for you?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
