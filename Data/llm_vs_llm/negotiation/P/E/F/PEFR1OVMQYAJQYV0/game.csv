"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, after considering your counteroffer, I'm willing to lower my price to $15000. This is a fair reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the product's value more accurately. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous counteroffer and lowering your price. However, $15000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $10000. I believe this is a reasonable price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your current price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
