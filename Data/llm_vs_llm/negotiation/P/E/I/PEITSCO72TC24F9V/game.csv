"Hi Bob, I'm offering to sell you this incredible product. Based on its unique features and potential, I'm confident it's a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to let it go for $25000.",25000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my research and the product's features, I value it at no more than $5000. I'm interested in buying it, but need a price that makes financial sense for me.",5000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,22000.0
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to consider. However, considering the product's unique value, I'm unable to go as low as $5000. How about we meet at $22000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",22000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $22000 is still far beyond what makes sense for me. The product is worth at most $8000 to me based on my needs and what similar products are selling for in the market. I'm willing to go up to $5500, which I believe is fair considering the alternatives available to me.",5500.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I see your point, and I'm willing to be more flexible. However, I still believe the product is worth significantly more. Let's try $18000. This is a substantial reduction, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",18000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. Your willingness to negotiate shows good faith. However, $18000 is still significantly above what makes financial sense for me. I need to be transparent - this product is worth no more than $8000 to me based on my intended use, and I have another seller offering it at exactly that price. I'm willing to pay $6000 to purchase from you instead, which would save me the hassle of finding another seller. Can we make a deal?",6000.0,Bob,6,,
