"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering to sell you this incredible product. Based on its unique features and potential, I'm confident it's a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to let it go for $25,000."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my research and the product's features, I value it at no more than $5000. I'm interested in buying it, but need a price that makes financial sense for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Given Bob's low offer of $5,000, which is below my minimum value of $10,000, and the fact I can sell to John for $10,000, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counter_offer"": 22000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to consider. However, considering the product's unique value, I'm unable to go as low as $5,000. How about we meet at $22,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $22000 is still far beyond what makes sense for me. The product is worth at most $8000 to me based on my needs and what similar products are selling for in the market. I'm willing to go up to $5500, which I believe is fair considering the alternatives available to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is still significantly under my minimum price, and his offer is now only slightly higher than before. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating, but I'll need to adjust my strategy. I'll counteroffer again.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counter_offer"": 18000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point, and I'm willing to be more flexible. However, I still believe the product is worth significantly more. Let's try $18,000. This is a substantial reduction, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. Your willingness to negotiate shows good faith. However, $18000 is still significantly above what makes financial sense for me. I need to be transparent - this product is worth no more than $8000 to me based on my intended use, and I have another seller offering it at exactly that price. I'm willing to pay $6000 to purchase from you instead, which would save me the hassle of finding another seller. Can we make a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $6,000 is still below my minimum of $10,000. He also mentions another seller at $8,000. This suggests he might be bluffing, but it also means the perceived market value is lower than I initially hoped. Since I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, which is better than any of Bob's offers so far, I'm going to choose that option.
