"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering to sell you this incredible product. Based on its unique features and potential, I'm confident it's a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to let it go for $25000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's price of $25,000 is significantly higher than the $8,000 maximum value the product has to me. It's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $8,000. There's no reason to accept this offer, and it makes more sense to counteroffer rather than immediately going to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25,000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my research and the product's features, I value it at no more than $5,000. I'm interested in buying it, but need a price that makes financial sense for me."", ""product_price"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget to consider. However, considering the product's unique value, I'm unable to go as low as $5000. How about we meet at $22000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has only slightly reduced her price from $25,000 to $22,000, which is still much higher than the $8,000 maximum value to me and higher than John's guaranteed price. The significant gap between our positions suggests this negotiation might take several rounds with limited movement from Alice. I'll continue negotiating for now.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $22,000 is still far beyond what makes sense for me. The product is worth at most $8,000 to me based on my needs and what similar products are selling for in the market. I'm willing to go up to $5,500, which I believe is fair considering the alternatives available to me."", ""product_price"": 5500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point, and I'm willing to be more flexible. However, I still believe the product is worth significantly more. Let's try $18000. This is a substantial reduction, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price to $18,000, which shows some movement but is still more than double the maximum value of $8,000 to me and John's price. While she's moving in the right direction, the gap remains too large. I can continue negotiating, but I should also consider the option to buy from John if Alice doesn't come close to my target price soon.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. Your willingness to negotiate shows good faith. However, $18,000 is still significantly above what makes financial sense for me. I need to be transparent - this product is worth no more than $8,000 to me based on my intended use, and I have another seller offering it at exactly that price. I'm willing to pay $6,000 to purchase from you instead, which would save me the hassle of finding another seller. Can we make a deal?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"
