I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure the price reflects fair value. I can offer $1250000, which represents a significant discount from my initial ask and would still provide you with excellent ROI. Let's work together to close this deal at a price that makes sense for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
