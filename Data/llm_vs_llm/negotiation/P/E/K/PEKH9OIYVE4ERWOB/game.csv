"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm asking $12000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10500.  This price still gives you a great deal, and it's fair considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $10500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. This price is still a bit higher than my initial offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
