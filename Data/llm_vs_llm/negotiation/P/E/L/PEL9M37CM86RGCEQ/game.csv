"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $13500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential value to you.",13500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13500 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget, I'd be willing to pay $10000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $10000 is too low for this product's value. I can come down from my initial offer, but considering the product's quality and market value, I can offer it for $12000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Bob,4,
