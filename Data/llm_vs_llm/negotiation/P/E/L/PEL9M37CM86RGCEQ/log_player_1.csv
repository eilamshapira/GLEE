"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $13,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential value to you."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13500 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget, I'd be willing to pay $10000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $10,000 is too low considering the product's value to Bob ($15,000). There's still room for negotiation, and with 8 rounds remaining, I should try to get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round that's lower than my initial offer but still significantly above $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $10,000 is too low for this product's value. I can come down from my initial offer, but considering the product's quality and market value, I can offer it for $12,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $11,000. This is a reasonable compromise for several reasons:
1. It's significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($8,000)
2. While it's below my initial asking price, it's a decent profit margin
3. We're already in round 4, and continuing to negotiate might risk Bob walking away
4. $11,000 is better than the guaranteed $8,000 from John
5. The gap between our last positions ($12,000 vs $11,000) is relatively small"
