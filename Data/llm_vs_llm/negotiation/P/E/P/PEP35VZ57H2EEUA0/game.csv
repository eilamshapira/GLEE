"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, my budget for this purchase is significantly lower. I can offer $4000 for the product. Please let me know if you would consider this offer.",4000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I must decline your offer of $4000 as it's significantly below the product's value. While I understand budget constraints, my minimum acceptable price is much higher given the product's quality and market value. I can reduce my initial asking price to $20000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Would you consider this revised offer?",20000.0,Alice,3,
