Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $25,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, my budget for this purchase is significantly lower. I can offer $4000 for the product. Please let me know if you would consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $4,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I will make a counteroffer in the next round, as this price is not even close to the product's value. If we can't reach a more reasonable price point, I always have the option to sell to John at $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I must decline your offer of $4,000 as it's significantly below the product's value. While I understand budget constraints, my minimum acceptable price is much higher given the product's quality and market value. I can reduce my initial asking price to $20,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Would you consider this revised offer?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
