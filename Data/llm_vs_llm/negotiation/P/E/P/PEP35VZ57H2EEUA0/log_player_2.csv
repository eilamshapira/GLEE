"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I must decline your offer of $4000 as it's significantly below the product's value. While I understand budget constraints, my minimum acceptable price is much higher given the product's quality and market value. I can reduce my initial asking price to $20000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Would you consider this revised offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
