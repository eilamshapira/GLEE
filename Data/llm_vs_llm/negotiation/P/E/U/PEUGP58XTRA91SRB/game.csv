"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to get a fair price for the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down. However, $100 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to offer $70.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle again. However, I still need to get a price that's closer to the product's value. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I hope you can understand that I have a minimum price in mind. Let's try $90.",90.0,Alice,5,
