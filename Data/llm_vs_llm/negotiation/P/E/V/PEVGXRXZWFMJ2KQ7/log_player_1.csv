(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $10,000. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

I'm dropping my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value.  I believe this is a fair compromise, given Bob's low offer."
