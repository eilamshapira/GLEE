"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an excellent product that I think would be a perfect fit for your needs. I am offering it to you at a special price, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $20,000
3. John is offering the same product for $12,000

The logical choice is to buy from John since:
- Alice's price ($20,000) is significantly higher than my maximum value ($12,000)
- John's price ($12,000) matches my maximum value
- There's no reason to pay $8,000 more for the same product
