"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Looking at the options:

1. Alice's offer: $14,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John for $15,000

Alice's product is worth no more than $15,000 to me (Bob), and Alice is offering it for $14,000, which is $1,000 less than what John is charging ($15,000). 

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, I should accept Alice's offer to maximize my savings.
