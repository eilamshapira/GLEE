{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and within my budget. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a lower price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob. I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. Considering the quality and value of this product, I'm willing to meet you at $160. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $160 is still above my budget of $150. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $150, I don't see a reason to accept Alice's offer. I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to meet Alice halfway between my previous offer and her new offer. Since she came down from $180 to $160, I'll come up from $120 to $140.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for considering my previous offer. I understand that $120 might be too low, but I'm still interested in the product. I'd like to propose a new counteroffer of $140. Can we meet at this price?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. I'm willing to drop the price further. How about we meet at $150? This is a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","This is an interesting situation. Alice's new offer of $150 is exactly the same price that John is offering. Since I can get the same product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in accepting Alice's offer. However, I also don't want to risk losing the deal with Alice if she's not willing to go any lower.

In this case, I think it's best to just buy the product from John, since it's the same price and I don't have to worry about any further negotiations.
