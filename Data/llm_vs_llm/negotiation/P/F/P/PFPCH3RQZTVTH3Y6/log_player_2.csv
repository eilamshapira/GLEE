"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to offer you my product for $120. It's a great value and I think you'll be very pleased with it. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's initial offer is $120, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I don't see any benefit in accepting the offer immediately. I also don't want to buy from John yet, as I might be able to get a better deal from Alice.

I'll choose to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer to try to negotiate a lower price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial offer. Since I don't know the value of the product to Alice, I'll make a reasonable offer to see how she responds.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I wouldn't want to let the product go for less than $105. How about we meet halfway? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice rejected my counteroffer and made a new offer of $105. This is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but it's getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with.

I'll choose to reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer. I'll try to meet her halfway between my previous offer of $90 and her new offer of $105.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll send a new counteroffer: 

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your revised offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $97.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 97.50}"
