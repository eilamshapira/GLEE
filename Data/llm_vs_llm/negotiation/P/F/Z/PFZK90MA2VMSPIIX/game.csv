"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, I've done some market research and found that I can purchase this same product from another seller for $1200000. That's actually the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product based on its value to me. I'd prefer to do business with you, so I'm countering with an offer of $1000000. This gives you a chance to make the sale while allowing me to save compared to my alternative option. Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
