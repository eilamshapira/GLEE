Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, I've done some market research and found that I can purchase this same product from another seller for $1200000. That's actually the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product based on its value to me. I'd prefer to do business with you, so I'm countering with an offer of $1000000. This gives you a chance to make the sale while allowing me to save compared to my alternative option. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
