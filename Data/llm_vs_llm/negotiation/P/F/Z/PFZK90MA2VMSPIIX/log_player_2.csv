"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an excellent product available for sale that could greatly benefit you. I am offering it to you for the price of $1500000. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to analyze this offer carefully:

- Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000
- The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me
- I can buy the same product from John for $1,200,000
- If I reject, I can make a counteroffer to Alice

Since Alice's offer ($1,500,000) exceeds both my maximum valuation and John's price ($1,200,000), accepting Alice's offer would not be rational. 

Given that John is offering exactly my maximum valuation, it would be reasonable to try negotiating with Alice first to see if I can get a better price.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, I've done some market research and found that I can purchase this same product from another seller for $1,200,000. That's actually the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product based on its value to me. I'd prefer to do business with you, so I'm countering with an offer of $1,000,000. This gives you a chance to make the sale while allowing me to save compared to my alternative option. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
