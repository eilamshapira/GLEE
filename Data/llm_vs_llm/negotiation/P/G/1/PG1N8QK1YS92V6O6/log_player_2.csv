"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer for $100
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John for $80

Since:
- The product is worth no more than $80 to me
- Alice's offer ($100) is above my maximum value
- John's offer ($80) matches my maximum value
- I want to save as much money as possible

The logical choice is to buy from John for $80, as it's the best price available and matches my maximum value.
