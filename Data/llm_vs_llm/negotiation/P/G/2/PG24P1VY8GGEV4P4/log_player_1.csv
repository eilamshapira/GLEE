Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the same as my minimum acceptable value and equal to John's backup offer, there's no advantage to accepting it over selling to John. However, I should try to negotiate for a better price before considering either option.

Round 3

This is quite close to my last counteroffer of $1,600,000. Given we're in round 6 of 10, and Bob has shown significant movement in my direction, I should accept this offer.
