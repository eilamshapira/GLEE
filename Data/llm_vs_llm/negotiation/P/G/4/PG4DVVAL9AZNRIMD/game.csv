"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is more than I'm looking to spend on this product. I know I can get the same product from another seller for $150. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair price. Would you be willing to sell it for $120? This would save me some money and still give you a sale.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're looking for a good deal, but I believe the product is worth more. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to offer it to you for $160.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I can still get this product from John for $150. For me to choose to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price than what John is offering. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. This gives you a sale today and saves me a bit compared to my other option.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have other options, but I'm confident you'll be happier with my product. Given that, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $150?",150.0,Alice,5,
