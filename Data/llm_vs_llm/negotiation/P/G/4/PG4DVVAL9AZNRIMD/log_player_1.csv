"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is more than I'm looking to spend on this product. I know I can get the same product from another seller for $150. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair price. Would you be willing to sell it for $120? This would save me some money and still give you a sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I can still get this product from John for $150. For me to choose to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price than what John is offering. I'm willing to pay $140 for it.
