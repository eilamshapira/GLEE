"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Given that I'm looking for a product that is worth no more than $150 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $150, Alice's offer of $200 is too high.

I could buy from John right away, but let me try negotiating with Alice first to see if I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is more than I'm looking to spend on this product. I know I can get the same product from another seller for $150. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair price. Would you be willing to sell it for $120? This would save me some money and still give you a sale."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're looking for a good deal, but I believe the product is worth more. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to offer it to you for $160. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and John is offering it for $150, Alice's offer of $160 is still too high. I can get a better deal from John right now, but let me see if Alice will go lower.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I can still get this product from John for $150. For me to choose to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price than what John is offering. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. This gives you a sale today and saves me a bit compared to my other option."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have other options, but I'm confident you'll be happier with my product. Given that, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has now offered the product for $150, which is the same price John is offering. Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and I can't get a better price from John, I might as well accept Alice's offer now.
