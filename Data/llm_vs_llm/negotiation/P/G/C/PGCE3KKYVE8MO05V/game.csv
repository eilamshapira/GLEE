"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $200, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your position, but I think $200 is too high. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $150 for this product. How about we settle for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you think $200 is too high, but I still believe the product is worth more than $100. I'm willing to compromise and lower my price. How about we meet in the middle at $175?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down a bit, but that's still too high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $110. Let's settle for that.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to raise your offer, Bob. However, $110 is still a bit too low for me. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering you've come up from $100, I'll come down a bit more from $175. Let's try $160. It's a significant compromise on my end, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $160 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. I'll raise my offer again to $120. Let's see if we can close the gap a bit more.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your increased offer, Bob. I see we're getting closer, but $120 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make another concession. Let's try $155. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value. If we can agree on this price, I think it would be a good deal for both of us.",155.0,Alice,7,
