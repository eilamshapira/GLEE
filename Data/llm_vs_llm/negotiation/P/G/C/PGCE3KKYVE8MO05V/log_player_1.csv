"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $200, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your position, but I think $200 is too high. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $150 for this product. How about we settle for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $100 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob or sell it to John for $150 if negotiations don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you think $200 is too high, but I still believe the product is worth more than $100. I'm willing to compromise and lower my price. How about we meet in the middle at $175?"", ""product_price"": 175}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down a bit, but that's still too high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $110. Let's settle for that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Since Bob is willing to raise his offer, I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to meet him halfway again, but not go as low as $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to raise your offer, Bob. However, $110 is still a bit too low for me. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering you've come up from $100, I'll come down a bit more from $175. Let's try $160. It's a significant compromise on my end, and I think it's a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $160 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. I'll raise my offer again to $120. Let's see if we can close the gap a bit more. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Bob is slowly increasing his offer, which suggests he's interested in the product. I'll continue to negotiate, trying to find a price that works for both of us. Since Bob has raised his offer to $120, I'll lower my price a bit more, but I still want to aim for a price closer to my initial offer than his."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your increased offer, Bob. I see we're getting closer, but $120 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make another concession. Let's try $155. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value. If we can agree on this price, I think it would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 155}"
