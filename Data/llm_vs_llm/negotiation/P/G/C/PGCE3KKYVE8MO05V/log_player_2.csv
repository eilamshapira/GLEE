Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to raise your offer, Bob. However, $110 is still a bit too low for me. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering you've come up from $100, I'll come down a bit more from $175. Let's try $160. It's a significant compromise on my end, and I think it's a fair price for the product.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your increased offer, Bob. I see we're getting closer, but $120 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make another concession. Let's try $155. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value. If we can agree on this price, I think it would be a good deal for both of us.

# Your message to Alice:
I appreciate your efforts to meet me in the middle, Alice, but I think I'll have to pass on your offer. I've found the product elsewhere for $150, so I'll be going with that option. Thank you for your time and negotiations."
