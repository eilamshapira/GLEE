"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than my maximum budget of $15,000, it's a good deal for me. I can save $3,000 by buying from Alice instead of John.
