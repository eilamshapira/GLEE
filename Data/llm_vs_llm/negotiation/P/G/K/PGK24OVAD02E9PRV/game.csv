"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product should be priced lower given its value to me. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. While I understand your position, $1050000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to be flexible and can reduce my initial asking price. I can offer the product for $1120000, which represents a fair compromise considering its value to both of us.",1120000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for your flexibility, Alice. I understand your position, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we settle at $1080000? This is a fair step up from my last offer and still within a reasonable range for both of us.",1080000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation and the increase in your offer. However, given that this product is worth $1200000 to you, I believe we can find a more equitable middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which would still provide you with significant value while being fair to both parties.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand the value you're placing on the product, but I need to keep my costs down. How about we meet at $1090000? This is a small increase from my last offer and should be a fair compromise for both of us.",1090000.0,Bob,6,
