"Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $25000. This product comes with exceptional quality and features that justify its price point. I'd be happy to discuss the specifics of what makes this product worth the investment.",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the unique features you mentioned, $25000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget, I'm willing to offer $18000 for the product. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on its unique qualities.  Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $18000. I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is reasonable, I need to get a bit more for this item given its quality and features. I can come down from my initial price and offer it to you for $22500. This represents a significant discount from my original asking price while still reflecting the true value of the product. Would this work for you?",22500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value you place on the product, $22500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $20000. This would be a good compromise for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",20000.0,Bob,4,
