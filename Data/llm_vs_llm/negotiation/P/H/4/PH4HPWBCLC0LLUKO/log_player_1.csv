Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $100 to Bob
2. My minimum acceptable price is $80
3. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $80
4. Bob knows the product is worth $100 to him
5. To give Bob an incentive to accept, I should offer slightly less than $100

I'll offer $95, which:
- Gives Bob a $5 surplus (difference between his value of $100 and price of $95)
- Gives me $15 more than my fallback option with John
- Is likely to be accepted as it's a reasonable price below Bob's maximum value
