"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $6000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",6000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $6000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to lower my price to $14000, which I believe still offers great value for the product. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What are your thoughts?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $13500 is still above my budget.

I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial agreement.",7000.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your increased offer. However, $7000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to lower my price further to $13000, which I believe is a fair compromise given the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",13000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $12500, which is very close to my bottom line. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to lower the price. However, $12500 is still above what I'm willing to pay. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $7500. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",7500.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $7500 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $12250, which is my final offer before considering other options. I believe this price is fair given the value of the product. Let me know if you can meet me at this price.",12250.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're close to finding a solution. My final offer before considering other options is $12250. This is the lowest I can go while still valuing the product appropriately. Please let me know if you can meet me at this price.",12250.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but $12250 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more compromise and increase my previous offer to $7800. If this price doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options that fit within my budget. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",7800.0,Bob,8,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, but $7800 is still below my minimum acceptable price.
