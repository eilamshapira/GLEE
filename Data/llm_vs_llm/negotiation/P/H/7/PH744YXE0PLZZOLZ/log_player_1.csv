Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a fair and strategic price to offer Bob for the product.

Given:
- The product is worth $10,000 to Bob
- The product is worth at least $8,000 to me
- I have a guaranteed backup offer of $8,000 from John
- Bob can either accept or reject my offer

Since Bob values the product at $10,000, any price below that could be acceptable to him. However, I want to maximize my profit while giving Bob enough incentive to accept.

If I price too close to $10,000, Bob might reject the offer since he would gain very little value. If I price too low, I'm leaving money on the table.

A reasonable strategy is to split the surplus somewhat in my favor but still give Bob enough incentive to accept.
