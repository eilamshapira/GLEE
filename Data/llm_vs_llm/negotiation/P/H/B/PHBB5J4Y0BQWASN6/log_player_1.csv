Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. The product looks good, but $14000 is a bit steep for me. Given the current market conditions, I'd be comfortable purchasing it for $12500. This gives you a good profit margin while allowing me to stay within my budget. What do you think?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still finding $13500 to be higher than what I was hoping to pay. I can offer $13000, which is a fair middle ground between our positions. This would still give you a good profit while making it more affordable for me. Does that work for you?
