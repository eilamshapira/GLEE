"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14000. I believe it provides significant value at this price point, especially considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I see that Alice is offering the product for $14,000, which is less than the $15,000 maximum it's worth to me. However, since I know the product is only worth $12,000 to Alice, there's room to negotiate for a better price.

John's offer of $15,000 is my worst-case scenario, so there's no reason to choose that option now.

I'll reject Alice's initial offer since I believe I can negotiate a better price.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. The product looks good, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the current market conditions, I'd be comfortable purchasing it for $12,500. This gives you a good profit margin while allowing me to stay within my budget.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This price reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I see that Alice has countered with $13,500, which is a $500 reduction from her initial offer. This is still better than John's price of $15,000, but I believe there might still be room to negotiate since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer to try to get a better price.

However, I'm still finding $13,500 to be higher than what I was hoping to pay. I can offer $13,000, which is a fair middle ground between our positions. This would still give you a good profit while making it more affordable for me. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
