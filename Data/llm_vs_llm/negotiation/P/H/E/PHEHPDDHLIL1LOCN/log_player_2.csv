"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is above even John's price of $12,000, I'll start with a low counteroffer to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer matches John's price of $12,000, and there's no indication Alice will go lower (given she rejected my $8,000 offer), it's best to end the negotiation now and buy from John. We won't get a better deal, and continuing the negotiation might risk losing time without any benefit."
