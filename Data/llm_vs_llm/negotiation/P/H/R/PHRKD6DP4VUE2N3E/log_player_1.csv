"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Considering the options:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer:** This would mean selling the product for $900,000, which is less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed:** This keeps the negotiation alive, but risks selling for less than my minimum, or losing the deal altogether.
*   **(3) Sell to John:** This guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price.

Since I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 available, and Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, I should take the safe option.
