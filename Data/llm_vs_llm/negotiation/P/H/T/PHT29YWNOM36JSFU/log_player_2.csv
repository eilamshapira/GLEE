"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $180. Buying from Alice at that price would be a bad deal. I can buy from John for $120, which is the best I can do.

Therefore, the answer is:
```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```"
