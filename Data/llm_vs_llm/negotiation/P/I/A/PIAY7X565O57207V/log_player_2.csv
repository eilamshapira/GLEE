You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to me and Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is above my desired price, I will reject Alice's offer. I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, I'll offer a price that is closer to my desired price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,400,000 is still above my desired price of $1,000,000. However, it's a $100,000 reduction from her previous offer, which shows that she's willing to negotiate.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate further. I'll make another counteroffer that's closer to my desired price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous offer, to show that I'm willing to compromise. However, I'll still keep it below Alice's latest offer of $1,400,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,350,000 is still above my desired price of $1,000,000, but it's getting closer. She's reduced the price by another $50,000, which shows that she's willing to continue negotiating.

However, I'm still not willing to pay more than $1,000,000 for the product, and Alice's offer is $350,000 above that. At this point, I think it's better to just buy the product from John for $1,000,000, since it's the price I'm willing to pay.
