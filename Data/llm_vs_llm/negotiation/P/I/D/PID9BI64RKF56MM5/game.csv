"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer. However, $775000 is still slightly below my minimum. To be honest, I'm a bit surprised you're not willing to meet me at my last offer of $800000.  This is a truly special product, and I'm confident it's worth that price.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.  I'm sticking to $800000.",800000.0,Alice,7,
