Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring I'm making a significant profit above my minimum value of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$800,000 is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum value. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product and Bob's initial lowball offer."
