Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic offer to Bob that maximizes my potential profit while ensuring I don't lose the sale unnecessarily. Since the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed backup buyer (John) at exactly that price, I should set my offer to Bob at a premium above this floor.

Without knowing Bob's maximum valuation, I'll set a price that gives me a good profit margin while still potentially being attractive to Bob.
