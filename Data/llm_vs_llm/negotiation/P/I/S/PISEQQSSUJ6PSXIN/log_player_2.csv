"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm asking $95 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's initial offer of $95 is close to my maximum budget of $100, but still a bit high, I'd like to try to negotiate a better price. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, to see how much room there is for negotiation. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll offer a price that's roughly halfway between what I think the product might be worth to Alice ($80) and Alice's initial offer ($95).

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counter, Bob. I appreciate your interest. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $90 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but it's getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with. Since I know that Alice is willing to sell the product for $80, I believe there's still some room for negotiation. I'll reject the offer again and try to make a more reasonable counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $90, and I previously offered $85, I'll try to split the difference and offer a price that's slightly higher than my previous offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and meet Alice halfway.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $87.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 87.50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close! The lowest I can realistically go is $89. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $89 is very close to my maximum budget of $100, and it's only $1 more than my previous counteroffer of $87.50, and $8 more than what the product is worth to Alice. Considering that Alice said this is the lowest she can go, I think it's likely that she's being honest about her limit. Given that I can still buy the product from John for $100, I'm willing to accept Alice's offer of $89, as it's still a better deal than what John is offering.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
