"Bob, I'm excited about the possibility of you acquiring this product. Given its unique value and the immense benefits it offers, I'm initially offering it to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential return on investment for you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I must be mindful of my budget. I know I can secure a similar product elsewhere for $800000. To justify choosing you and to reflect some goodwill in our negotiation, I'm willing to proceed if we can settle at $750000. Let me know if we can work with that.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $750000 is too low. The product's value is substantial. I'm willing to come down a bit to keep negotiations moving. How about $925000?",925000.0,Alice,3,
