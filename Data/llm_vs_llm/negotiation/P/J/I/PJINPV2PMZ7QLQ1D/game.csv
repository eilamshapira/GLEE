"Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at a price of $2400000. This product is of exceptional quality and represents a significant market opportunity. What do you think about this offer?",2400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I agree your product has potential, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $400000.",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $400000 is significantly below the product's value. The product is worth no less than $1500000 to me, and I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1900000, which represents a substantial discount from my original offer. This price better reflects the true market value and potential of the product while still giving you room to profit.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price, but the gap between our valuations is still too wide. I understand the product's potential, but I need to be realistic about my own budget and potential return. I could go up to $550000. If that's not workable, I understand, but I think it's a fair offer.",550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand budget constraints, but there remains a significant gap between our positions. My product has a secured minimum value of $1500000, which is what John is ready to pay. I'm still interested in working with you, but I need to be practical about the product's established value. I can come down to $1750000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price acknowledges your interest while still respecting the product's proven market value. If we can't bridge this gap significantly, I'll need to proceed with my alternative option.",1750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your current price is still well outside my budget.  I'm willing to make one last move to  $650000.  However, if we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.  I believe this is a fair offer given my constraints.",650000.0,Bob,6,
