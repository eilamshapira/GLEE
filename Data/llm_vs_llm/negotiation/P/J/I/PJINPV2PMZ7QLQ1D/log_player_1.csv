Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $400,000 is significantly below the product's value. The product is worth no less than $1,500,000 to me, and I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1,900,000, which represents a substantial discount from my original offer. This price better reflects the true market value and potential of the product while still giving you room to profit."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"

I understand the product's potential, but I need to be realistic about my own budget and potential return. I could go up to $550000. If that's not workable, I understand, but I think it's a fair offer.
