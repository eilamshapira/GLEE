Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $400000 is significantly below the product's value. The product is worth no less than $1500000 to me, and I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1900000, which represents a substantial discount from my original offer. This price better reflects the true market value and potential of the product while still giving you room to profit.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand budget constraints, but there remains a significant gap between our positions. My product has a secured minimum value of $1500000, which is what John is ready to pay. I'm still interested in working with you, but I need to be practical about the product's established value. I can come down to $1750000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price acknowledges your interest while still respecting the product's proven market value. If we can't bridge this gap significantly, I'll need to proceed with my alternative option.
