"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product that I think you'll love. It's a unique item that I'm willing to part with for a competitive price. If you're interested, please let me know and we can finalize the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully against my alternatives.

Alice is offering the product for $160, but the product is only worth $150 to me. Since I wouldn't get positive value from paying more than the product is worth to me, and I have a guaranteed option to buy from John for exactly $150, I should not accept Alice's offer.
