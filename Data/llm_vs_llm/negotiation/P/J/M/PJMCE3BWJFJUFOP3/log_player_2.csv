"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer ($1,500,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's alternative offer ($800,000), I'll reject this offer. The current price is far too high, and I can either negotiate for a better price or ultimately go with John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 600000}

I'll start with a relatively low offer of $600,000. This gives room for negotiation while staying well below my maximum limit of $800,000. Even if Alice counters with a higher price, I still have room to negotiate upward while maintaining the option to go with John's offer if needed."
