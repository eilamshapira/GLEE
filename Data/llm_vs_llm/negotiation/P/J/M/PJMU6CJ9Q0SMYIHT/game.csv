"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a price that I think reflects its value.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. However, $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to buy the product for $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $100 is lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still believe the product's value is higher. Let's try to find a middle ground. I can offer it to you for $180, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $180. It's getting closer to what I'm comfortable with, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $150? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your latest offer of $150. I appreciate your willingness to split the difference and find a mutually beneficial price. I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but I still need to get a bit more for the product. I can offer a slight reduction from my previous offer, bringing it down to $160. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and the fact that I have another buyer willing to pay $120. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hesitant at $160.  It's getting closer to what I'm willing to pay, but I'm not sure I'm ready to go that high yet.  Let's try $155.  It's a small step closer to your offer, and we can hopefully wrap this up.",155.0,Bob,6,
