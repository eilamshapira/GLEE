Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. However, $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to buy the product for $100. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price. Since Bob's offer is $100 and I know I can sell it to John for $120, I'll try to meet Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer, but still above the price John is willing to pay. 

My counteroffer to Bob: $180"

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still believe the product's value is higher. Let's try to find a middle ground. I can offer it to you for $180, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $180. It's getting closer to what I'm comfortable with, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $150? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since Bob is willing to pay $150, which is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, I'll try to meet him closer to his offer while still trying to maximize my earnings. I'll reduce my offer slightly, hoping to find an agreement.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your latest offer of $150. I appreciate your willingness to split the difference and find a mutually beneficial price. I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but I still need to get a bit more for the product. I can offer a slight reduction from my previous offer, bringing it down to $160. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and the fact that I have another buyer willing to pay $120. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hesitant at $160.  It's getting closer to what I'm willing to pay, but I'm not sure I'm ready to go that high yet.  Let's try $155.  It's a small step closer to your offer, and we can hopefully wrap this up. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I've decided to accept Bob's offer of $155. We've negotiated back and forth, and he's steadily increased his offer to a point where it's close enough to my target price that I'm willing to accept it. Accepting this offer ensures I earn more than the $120 that John is willing to pay, and it brings the negotiation to a close, allowing me to finalize the sale."
