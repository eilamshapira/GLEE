You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $100 is lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still believe the product's value is higher. Let's try to find a middle ground. I can offer it to you for $180, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your latest offer of $150. I appreciate your willingness to split the difference and find a mutually beneficial price. I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but I still need to get a bit more for the product. I can offer a slight reduction from my previous offer, bringing it down to $160. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and the fact that I have another buyer willing to pay $120. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.
