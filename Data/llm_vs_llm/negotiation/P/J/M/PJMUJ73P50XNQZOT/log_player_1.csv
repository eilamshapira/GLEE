"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 2,500,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","$400,000 is far too low, as it's well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. There's no reason to accept this offer when I have John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. However, I'll reject and continue negotiating with Bob for now, as there's potential to get a better price than John's offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still maintain a strong position well above my minimum price.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","$600,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and Bob's incremental increase from $400,000 to $600,000 suggests he might not be willing to reach my minimum price. However, I'll give one more chance before considering selling to John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price again but make it clear that I need a price well above my minimum threshold.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offers are still far below my minimum price of $1,500,000, and the pattern of his increases ($400k → $600k → $750k) suggests he's unlikely to reach my minimum price. Given we're already in round 6 of 10, and his current offer is still only half of John's guaranteed offer, it's time to take the sure deal with John.
