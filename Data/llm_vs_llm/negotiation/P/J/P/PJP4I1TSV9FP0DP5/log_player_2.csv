"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm happy you're interested in my product. It's a valuable item and I'm confident it will be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $18000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $18,000, which is significantly above my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $12,000

Alice's offer of $18,000 is far too high, and even if I were to make a counteroffer, it seems unlikely that Alice would drop the price below the $15,000 that the product is worth to her. Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value ($12,000), it makes the most sense to:
