"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you an exclusive product that I think you'll really value. I'm offering it to you for $10000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'll analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $10,000
3. John is offering the same product for $8,000

Since Alice's offer ($10,000) is higher than both:
- The maximum value I place on the product ($8,000)
- John's alternative offer ($8,000)

The logical choice is to buy from John, as it saves me $2,000 compared to Alice's offer and matches my maximum valuation.
