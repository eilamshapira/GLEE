"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20000. I believe it's a fair price, but I'm open to negotiations.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000 for this product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $10000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to compromise and lower my initial price. I can offer it to you for $18000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $18000 is still a bit high for me. I can stretch my budget to $11000. Is this something you can work with?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I can meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $14500. I'm trying to stay within my budget. How about we settle at $11500? I think this is a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, I'm still not quite at a price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $13500. This is as low as I'm willing to go without considering other options.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12000, which is the maximum I can afford. If this works for you, let's close the deal.",12000.0,Bob,8,
