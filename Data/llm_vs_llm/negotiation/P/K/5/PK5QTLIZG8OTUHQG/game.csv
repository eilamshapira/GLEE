"Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $2500000. This is a one-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested.",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is significantly above my budget. I know the value of this product and I can get it elsewhere for much less. I would be willing to offer $800000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $800000 is below my minimum threshold for this product. I am willing to come down to $2000000, considering your budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",2000000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to lower my offer to $1800000 as a final gesture to meet you halfway. Please consider this offer seriously.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice, but $1800000 is still far above what I can justify paying. I have another seller offering the same product for $1000000, but I'm willing to work with you if we can reach a reasonable price. I can increase my offer to $900000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $900000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to lower my price further to $1600000, which is very close to my bottom line. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope you can see the value in this offer.",1600000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand the urgency to reach an agreement. Given your last offer and my need to meet you closer to your budget, I'm willing to drop the price to $1550000. This is my final offer before considering other options. Please let me know if this works for you.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
