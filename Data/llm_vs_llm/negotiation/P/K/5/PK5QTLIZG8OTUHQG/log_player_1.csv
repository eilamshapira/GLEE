Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $2,500,000. This is a one-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is significantly above my budget. I know the value of this product and I can get it elsewhere for much less. I would be willing to offer $800000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice, but $1800000 is still far above what I can justify paying. I have another seller offering the same product for $1000000, but I'm willing to work with you if we can reach a reasonable price. I can increase my offer to $900000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer.

This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope you can see the value in this offer."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
