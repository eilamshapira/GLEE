"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $2500000. This is a one-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $2,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,000,000. It's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $1,000,000. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can negotiate a better price, knowing I always have John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I know the value of this product and I can get it elsewhere for much less. I would be willing to offer $800,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to lower my offer to $1800000 as a final gesture to meet you halfway. Please consider this offer seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,800,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000). While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing the price, it's still not enough. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, as there's still room for negotiation and plenty of rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice, but $1,800,000 is still far above what I can justify paying. I have another seller offering the same product for $1,000,000, but I'm willing to work with you if we can reach a reasonable price. I can increase my offer to $900,000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the urgency to reach an agreement. Given your last offer and my need to meet you closer to your budget, I'm willing to drop the price to $1550000. This is my final offer before considering other options. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Given that Alice's latest offer of $1,550,000 is still significantly above John's price of $1,000,000 and above my maximum value, and considering that Alice's price reductions have been relatively small, it's best to take John's offer. Alice seems unlikely to drop the price below $1,000,000 in subsequent rounds, and there's no reason to pay more than necessary. John's price is guaranteed and within my budget, so I'll purchase from him instead."
