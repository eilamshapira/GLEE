"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can actually get the same product from John for $150, so your price doesn't give me any reason to buy from you instead. Since the product costs you $100, I'd like to propose a more mutually beneficial deal. How about I purchase it from you for $125? This gives you a $25 profit and saves me $25 compared to John's price. This way we both come out ahead.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but given the product's quality and value, I believe a slightly higher price is fair. How about we agree on $140? This still gives you a notable saving compared to other options while ensuring I cover my costs and a fair margin. Let me know your thoughts.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. Since the product costs you $100, I think we can find an even better middle ground. I'm willing to offer $130, which gives you a solid $30 profit while saving me $20 compared to John's price. This seems fair for both of us - you make a good margin and I get a reasonable discount. What do you say?",130.0,Bob,4,
