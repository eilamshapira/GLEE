Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can actually get the same product from John for $150, so your price doesn't give me any reason to buy from you instead. Since the product costs you $100, I'd like to propose a more mutually beneficial deal. How about I purchase it from you for $125? This gives you a $25 profit and saves me $25 compared to John's price. This way we both come out ahead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. Since the product costs you $100, I think we can find an even better middle ground. I'm willing to offer $130, which gives you a solid $30 profit while saving me $20 compared to John's price. This seems fair for both of us - you make a good margin and I get a reasonable discount. What do you say?
