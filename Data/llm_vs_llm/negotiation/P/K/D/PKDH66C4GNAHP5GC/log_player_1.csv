"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, which is my fallback option with John. This high initial offer is meant to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget for this product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not going to undervalue the product."
