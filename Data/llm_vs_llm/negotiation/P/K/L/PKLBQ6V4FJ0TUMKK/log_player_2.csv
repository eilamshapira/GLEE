"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $18,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000), it would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. The best option is to buy from John, as this ensures I get the product at the maximum price I'm willing to pay.
