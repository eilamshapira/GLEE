"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting high, hoping to get a good price. I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, so this is a good starting point. I'll be prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $10,000 is too low for me, especially considering I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to $13,000. This is still a good price for me, and I'm hoping it's attractive enough for Bob to consider. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While $11,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to squeeze out just a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $12,500. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hoping it will be enough to close the deal. If Bob rejects this, I'm going to start seriously considering selling to John."
