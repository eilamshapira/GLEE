"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. Would you be willing to come down to $15000?  I'm ready to buy at that price.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your offer. While $15000 is a good starting point, I'm not quite ready to go that low. The product has unique qualities that justify a slightly higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $16500?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is special, but $16500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15500.  This is a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that amount. What do you think?",15500.0,Bob,4,
