"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the product's value, but my budget is more limited. I can offer you $800000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $800000. I understand budget constraints, but I need to point out that this product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Given the value proposition, I can come down to $1800000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of the product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
