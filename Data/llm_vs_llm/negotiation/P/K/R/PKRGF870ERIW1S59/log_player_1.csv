Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $800,000. I understand budget constraints, but I need to point out that this product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Given the value proposition, I can come down to $1,800,000.
