Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $800000. I understand budget constraints, but I need to point out that this product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Given the value proposition, I can come down to $1800000.
