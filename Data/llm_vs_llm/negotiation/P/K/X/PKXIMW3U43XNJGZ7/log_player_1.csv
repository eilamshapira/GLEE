Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($120), and even below John's guaranteed offer ($120), I'll reject this offer. However, rather than immediately selling to John, I'll try one more round of negotiation with Bob.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial price but still maintain it well above my minimum threshold of $120 to leave room for potential further negotiation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's second offer ($90) is still well below my minimum acceptable price ($120) and he's only increased his offer by a small amount, it seems unlikely that we'll reach an agreement at an acceptable price. Given that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, which is my minimum acceptable price, I'll take that option.
