"Hello Bob, I have a product that I think might be of interest to you. It's a high-quality item that I'm currently offering for $13500. I believe this is a fair market price given its features and condition. I'd be happy to discuss this offer with you if you're interested.",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13500 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to purchase the product for $8000. Would you consider this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest and offer. I understand budget constraints, but I'm afraid $8000 is below what I can accept for this product. The product is worth at least $10000 to me, and I already have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase it at that price. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. Would you consider $10500? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents good value for this product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9000. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
