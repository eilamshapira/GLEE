Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest and offer. I understand budget constraints, but I'm afraid $8,000 is below what I can accept for this product. The product is worth at least $10,000 to me, and I already have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase it at that price. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. Would you consider $10,500? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents good value for this product."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
