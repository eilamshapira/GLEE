Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest and offer. I understand budget constraints, but I'm afraid $8000 is below what I can accept for this product. The product is worth at least $10000 to me, and I already have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase it at that price. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. Would you consider $10500? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents good value for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
