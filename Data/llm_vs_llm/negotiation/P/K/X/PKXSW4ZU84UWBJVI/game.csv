"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $60, considering the product's value and my willingness to purchase it from you.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. However, $60 is too low for this product's value. I can offer it to you for $130. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, considering the product's quality.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate the reduction in price. However, $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $70, which is a compromise considering my budget and the product's value.",70.0,Bob,4,
