Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product to offer you today. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it to you for $150. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $60, considering the product's value and my willingness to purchase it from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $60 since it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and even below John's guaranteed offer. I'll make a new counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. However, $60 is too low for this product's value. I can offer it to you for $130. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, considering the product's quality.""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate the reduction in price. However, $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $70, which is a compromise considering my budget and the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $70 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and his increase from $60 to $70 suggests he may not be willing to reach my minimum price, I'll take the guaranteed $100 from John rather than continue negotiations that may not lead to a better outcome."
