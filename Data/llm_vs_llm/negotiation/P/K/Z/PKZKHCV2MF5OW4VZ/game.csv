"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the unique opportunity you're presenting, I must say that $1500000 is significantly above my budget. Given my market research and comparable products, I would be willing to offer $900000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my financial constraints. I look forward to your response.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate you taking the time to evaluate the product and present your perspective. While $900000 is a step in the right direction, it doesn't quite align with the value I place on the product. Given its unique features and the potential return on investment, I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to be closer to $1300000. Let's meet in the middle a bit more.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
