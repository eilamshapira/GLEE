Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the unique opportunity you're presenting, I must say that $1500000 is significantly above my budget. Given my market research and comparable products, I would be willing to offer $900000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my financial constraints. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it doesn't quite align with the value I place on the product.
