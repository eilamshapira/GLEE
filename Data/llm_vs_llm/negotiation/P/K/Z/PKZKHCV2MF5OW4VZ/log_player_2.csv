While I appreciate the unique opportunity you're presenting, I must say that $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate you taking the time to evaluate the product and present your perspective. While $900000 is a step in the right direction, it doesn't quite align with the value I place on the product. Given its unique features and the potential return on investment, I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to be closer to $1300000. Let's meet in the middle a bit more. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
