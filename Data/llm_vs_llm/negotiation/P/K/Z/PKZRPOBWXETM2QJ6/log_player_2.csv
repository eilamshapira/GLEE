"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I notice that Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is more than the $10,000 it's worth to me. Meanwhile, John is willing to sell the same product for $10,000.

Since Alice's price exceeds both my maximum value and John's alternative price, the logical choice is to buy from John instead of accepting Alice's offer.
