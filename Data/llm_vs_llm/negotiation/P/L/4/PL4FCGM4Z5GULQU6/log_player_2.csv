"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I’m offering you an exclusive opportunity to own this unique product for $10000000. I must mention that if you decide not to take advantage of this offer, I’m set to sell it to another buyer for $1000000. Please let me know if you’d like to move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,000,000
2. Alice is offering the product for $10,000,000, which is way above my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $1,000,000, which matches my maximum value
4. Alice's offer is 10 times higher than John's price

Since Alice's offer ($10,000,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price ($1,000,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept her offer. The best decision would be to buy from John.
