"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $25000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I'd like to make a counteroffer. Based on my research, I think a fair price would be around $10000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your perspective, $10000 is significantly below the product's value to me. To be fair, I can come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $22000?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from the initial price. However, $22000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your new offer isn't feasible for me. How about we do $12500?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I can't go that low. My bottom line is higher than that. How about we settle at $20000? This is the lowest I can realistically go.",20000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to lower the price. However, $20000 is still a bit steep for me. Considering your last message, I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further. How about we meet at $14000? This is the highest I'm comfortable going.",14000.0,Bob,6,
