"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm very excited to offer you this exclusive product. Based on its quality and features, I'm setting the initial price at $25,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $25000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I'd like to make a counteroffer. Based on my research, I think a fair price would be around $10000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Okay, Bob's counteroffer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $10,000. I need to counter his offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is significantly below the product's value to me. To be fair, I can come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $22,000?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from the initial price. However, $22000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your new offer isn't feasible for me. How about we do $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's counteroffer is still too low. Selling for $12,500 would be a loss. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I can't go that low. My bottom line is higher than that. How about we settle at $20,000? This is the lowest I can realistically go."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to lower the price. However, $20000 is still a bit steep for me. Considering your last message, I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further. How about we meet at $14000? This is the highest I'm comfortable going. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is still below my minimum. This is getting risky, as the deal might fall through. I think I should sell to John.
