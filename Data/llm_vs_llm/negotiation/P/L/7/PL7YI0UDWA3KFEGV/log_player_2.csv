"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer of $250 is way above my maximum value of $80. It makes more sense to reject and make a counteroffer, as I can always fall back to John's $80 offer if negotiations with Alice don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 40}

I'll start with a low offer of $40, which is half of my maximum value ($80). This gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's offer. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground, and I still have John's $80 offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $200 is still way above my maximum value of $80. While she did reduce the price from $250 to $200, it's still not close to a reasonable range for me. I'll reject and make another counteroffer. If we can't reach a reasonable price, I can still buy from John at $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 50}

I'll increase my offer slightly to $50 to show some willingness to negotiate, but still maintain a good position for myself. This is still well below my maximum value of $80, giving me room to negotiate further if needed. If Alice doesn't come down to a reasonable price range, I can always fall back on John's $80 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offers are consistently remaining far above my maximum value of $80, only coming down by small increments ($250 -> $200 -> $180). At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach an agreement below $80, and we've already used half of our negotiation rounds. The most rational decision is to take John's guaranteed offer of $80, which is my maximum value for the product."
