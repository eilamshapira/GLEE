"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $12,000 and also higher than John's alternative offer. It would be better to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice than the current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 8000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $8,000. This is significantly below my maximum value of $12,000 and John's price, which gives room for negotiation. If Alice rejects this offer, we can still work towards finding a middle ground that's below John's price of $12,000. This strategy allows for some back-and-forth while ensuring I don't end up paying more than my maximum value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $16,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's alternative price ($12,000). While Alice has reduced the price from the initial $18,000, it's still not competitive with John's offer. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price below $12,000. If Alice remains inflexible in future rounds, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9500}

I'll increase my previous offer to $9,500. This is a significant increase from my previous offer of $8,000, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying well below both my maximum value and John's price of $12,000. This leaves room for further negotiation while demonstrating that I'm making substantial moves toward meeting in the middle. If Alice doesn't come down to a price below $12,000 in the next rounds, I can always take John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $12,000. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($14,500) is still well above John's price ($12,000)
2. While Alice has been gradually reducing her price ($18,000 → $16,000 → $14,500), the rate of reduction suggests we're unlikely to get below John's price in the remaining rounds
3. Even if Alice eventually comes down further, it likely won't be significantly below $12,000
4. John's price is already at my maximum value point ($12,000)

It's better to secure the deal at $12,000 now rather than continue negotiations that may not lead to a better outcome."
