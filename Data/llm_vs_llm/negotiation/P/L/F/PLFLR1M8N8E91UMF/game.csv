"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $20000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. Based on my research and budget constraints, I can offer $8000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the market alternatives. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20000 may be out of your budget, but $8000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Considering the product's value and market alternatives, I'm willing to lower my price. However, I need to ensure I get a fair deal.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price to $15000. However, that's still more than I can justify spending on this product. I've received an alternative offer of $12000 for the same product elsewhere, but I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can increase my offer to $10000, which I believe is fair considering the market value. This would save you the trouble of finding another buyer and allow us to close the deal quickly.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $10000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your preference to do business with me. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Considering your alternative offer of $12000 from elsewhere, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer of $15000 and your current offer. I'm hoping we can close the deal quickly and avoid the hassle of finding another buyer.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be transparent that I have a firm offer of $12000 from another seller. Since that's the maximum I can justify paying for this product based on its value to me, I can only continue our negotiations if we can beat that price. My final offer is $11500, which would save me $500 compared to my alternative option. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $12000, I'll unfortunately need to go with the other seller.",11500.0,Bob,6,
