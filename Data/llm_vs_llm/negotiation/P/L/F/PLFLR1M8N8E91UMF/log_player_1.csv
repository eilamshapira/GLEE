"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $20000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. Based on my research and budget constraints, I can offer $8000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the market alternatives. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $8,000 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. In the next round, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20,000 may be out of your budget, but $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Considering the product's value and market alternatives, I'm willing to lower my price. However, I need to ensure I get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price to $15000. However, that's still more than I can justify spending on this product. I've received an alternative offer of $12000 for the same product elsewhere, but I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can increase my offer to $10000, which I believe is fair considering the market value. This would save you the trouble of finding another buyer and allow us to close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $10,000 because it's still below my target price, and I have a better alternative with John's offer of $12,000. However, I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a better agreement. In the next round, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, trying to meet him halfway between my previous offer and his current offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $10,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your preference to do business with me.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be transparent that I have a firm offer of $12000 from another seller. Since that's the maximum I can justify paying for this product based on its value to me, I can only continue our negotiations if we can beat that price. My final offer is $11500, which would save me $500 compared to my alternative option. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $12000, I'll unfortunately need to go with the other seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

I decide to sell the product to John for $12,000. Bob's final offer of $11,500 is close, but since I have a guaranteed offer of $12,000 from John, it's a better option for me. I don't want to risk continuing negotiations with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price or no deal at all. Selling to John ensures I get a fair price and avoids further uncertainty."
