"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given Alice's offer of $20,000, which is significantly higher than the product's worth to me ($12,000) and also higher than John's alternative offer, it wouldn't make sense to accept.

Since John is willing to sell the product for $12,000, which matches the maximum value the product has to me, I should either make a counteroffer to Alice that's below $12,000 (to potentially save money) or simply buy from John.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $20,000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. Based on my research and budget constraints, I can offer $8,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the market alternatives. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20000 may be out of your budget, but $8000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Considering the product's value and market alternatives, I'm willing to lower my price. However, I need to ensure I get a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has lowered her price to $15,000, which is still above the $12,000 John is offering and above the maximum value the product has to me. 

Since John's offer of $12,000 is both lower than Alice's current offer and matches the maximum value I place on the product, Alice would need to offer a better price for me to consider continuing negotiations with her.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price to $15,000. However, that's still more than I can justify spending on this product. I've received an alternative offer of $12,000 for the same product elsewhere, but I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can increase my offer to $10,000, which I believe is fair considering the market value. This would save you the trouble of finding another buyer and allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $10000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your preference to do business with me. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Considering your alternative offer of $12000 from elsewhere, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer of $15000 and your current offer. I'm hoping we can close the deal quickly and avoid the hassle of finding another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has now offered $13,500, which is still above John's price of $12,000. Since the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed option to buy it for exactly $12,000 from John, there's no reason for me to pay more than that.

Alice's offer doesn't provide any value compared to my alternative. I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be transparent that I have a firm offer of $12,000 from another seller. Since that's the maximum I can justify paying for this product based on its value to me, I can only continue our negotiations if we can beat that price. My final offer is $11,500, which would save me $500 compared to my alternative option. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $12,000, I'll unfortunately need to go with the other seller."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
