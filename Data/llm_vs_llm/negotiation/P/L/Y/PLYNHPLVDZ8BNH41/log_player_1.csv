Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'd prefer to make a bit more, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation. Selling to John guarantees me a good price, and I'm confident I can find another buyer in the future if I need to."
