"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality and rarity of the product, I have a budget that I need to work within. I can offer you $1000000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering the circumstances.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $1400000, which is still a competitive price. I'm confident we can work out a deal that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you, Alice, for considering a compromise. I truly value the product, but I am still unable to meet your current offer. I can increase my bid to $1100000. I'm hopeful that this amount works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current bid. I can offer the product to you for $1250000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
