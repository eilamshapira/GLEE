Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Considering my minimum value is $80, I have to reject Bob's offer.

My decision: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","This is a tough spot. I can sell to John for $80, guaranteeing that amount. Bob is offering $80.

Given that I don't know how much Bob values the product, there's a chance he'll go higher, but also a chance he'll go lower or walk away. Since I can guarantee $80 with John, and Bob is currently offering $80, there's no financial incentive to risk a lower price.

My decision: {""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
