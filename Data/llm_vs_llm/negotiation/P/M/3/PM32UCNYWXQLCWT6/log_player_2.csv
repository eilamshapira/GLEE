"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer matches your maximum price, there's a chance to get a better deal. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to lower the price before settling for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a significantly lower offer (but not insultingly low) gives room for negotiation. It allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a much better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice dropping her price by $10 suggests there's still room for negotiation.  I'll try pushing a bit further before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to move, but still aiming for a price well below Alice's initial offer and John's alternative."
