Send your offer to Bob.,"I'm considering my strategy here. I need to decide on a price to offer Bob that maximizes my profit while still giving him a reasonable chance of accepting.

Since I don't know how much the product is worth to Bob, I need to balance the risk. If I set the price too high, Bob might reject it, and I'd only get $12,000 from selling to John. If I set it too low, I might leave money on the table.

I'll offer a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value, but not so high that it would seem unreasonable to a potential buyer.
