"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product. I'm offering it to you at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,200,000
2. Alice's offer is $1,100,000
3. John's fixed price is $1,200,000
4. Alice's cost is $800,000, so there's room for negotiation

The current offer ($1,100,000) is below my maximum value and better than John's price, but there's still potential to negotiate for a better price since Alice has a significant profit margin. Since we have 10 rounds available, it's worth trying to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but leaves room for negotiation. Since Alice's cost is $800,000, I'll start with a price that's still profitable for her but significantly better for me.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial price. Given market conditions, I'd like to propose $900,000 for the product. This still provides you with a healthy profit margin while being more aligned with my budget."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from. How about we meet in the middle at $1000000? I believe that reflects a fair value for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the current situation:

1. Alice has moved down from $1,100,000 to $1,000,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. This is a $200,000 savings compared to John's price
3. Alice's cost is $800,000, so she's still making a good profit
4. While we could try to negotiate further, $1,000,000 is a reasonable price point

Given that:
- The offer represents a significant improvement from the initial price
- It's substantially better than John's alternative
- The price point seems fair considering both parties' positions
- Further negotiation might risk souring the deal
