"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd really like. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer is $100, which is exactly the same as John's price, and both prices are at my maximum willingness to pay ($100), I am indifferent between the two options. In this case, I might as well accept Alice's offer since she made the effort to reach out.
