Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2500000}

I'm offering a price of $2.5 million. This is a reasonable starting point because:
1. I know the product is worth at least $1 million to me
2. If Bob values the product significantly higher, this gives me a chance to capture more value
3. If Bob rejects, I still have my guaranteed $1 million from John
4. Starting with a higher price gives room for potential negotiation while staying above my minimum acceptable price"
