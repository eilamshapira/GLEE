"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $950000 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth more than $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $900000. This price reflects the product's value and takes into account your interest in purchasing it. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. How about we settle at $800000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being within my budget. Let me know your thoughts!",800000.0,Bob,4,
