I believe it holds great value, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects its worth.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $950000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to counter with $750000. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $750,000 because it's lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'd like to counteroffer to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My next offer will be $900,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth more than $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $900,000. This price reflects the product's value and takes into account your interest in purchasing it. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. How about we settle at $800000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being within my budget. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob's offer of $800,000 is the same price that John is willing to pay, and I don't have any additional information that would suggest Bob is a more desirable buyer, I will choose to sell the product to John for $800,000. This ensures I get the price I'm willing to accept without further negotiation."
