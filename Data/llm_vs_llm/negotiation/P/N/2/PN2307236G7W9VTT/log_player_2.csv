"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it holds significant potential value for you. I'm starting the discussion at $25000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering the product for $25,000, which is significantly higher than the maximum value of $8,000 that the product is worth to me. Additionally, I have the option to buy the same product from John for exactly $8,000.

Since Alice's offer exceeds the product's value to me by a large margin, and I already have a guaranteed option at the maximum price I'm willing to pay, the rational decision would be to buy from John.
