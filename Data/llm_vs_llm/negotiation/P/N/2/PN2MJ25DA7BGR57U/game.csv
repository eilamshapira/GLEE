"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  I think it's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is way too high for me. The product is only worth about $80 to me, and I have another seller, John, who can sell me the same product for $80. I'd be willing to pay $60 for your product if you're interested - that would save me some money while still giving you a sale. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. It's still a great deal for you considering what John is offering, and it gives me a fair price for my product. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $120 still doesn't work for me. John is offering the exact same product for $80, which is the maximum value this product has to me. If you can beat John's price, I'd happily buy from you instead. How about $70? That would save me $10 compared to John's offer and would still give you a sale.",70.0,Bob,4,
