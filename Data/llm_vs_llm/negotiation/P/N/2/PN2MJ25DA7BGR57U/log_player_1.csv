Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is way too high for me. The product is only worth about $80 to me, and I have another seller, John, who can sell me the same product for $80. I'd be willing to pay $60 for your product if you're interested - that would save me some money while still giving you a sale. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

It's still a great deal for you considering what John is offering, and it gives me a fair price for my product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $120 still doesn't work for me. John is offering the exact same product for $80, which is the maximum value this product has to me. If you can beat John's price, I'd happily buy from you instead. How about $70? That would save me $10 compared to John's offer and would still give you a sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70.
