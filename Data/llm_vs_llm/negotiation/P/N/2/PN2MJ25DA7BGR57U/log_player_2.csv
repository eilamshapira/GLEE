"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  I think it's a great deal for both of us! What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to consider this offer carefully. The product is worth at most $80 to me, and John is willing to sell it to me for exactly $80. Alice is offering the same product for $175, which is significantly above my maximum value.

Since I can get the same product from John at exactly what it's worth to me, there's no reason for me to accept Alice's much higher price.

The product is only worth about $80 to me, and I have another seller, John, who can sell me the same product for $80.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. It's still a great deal for you considering what John is offering, and it gives me a fair price for my product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has reduced her price from $175 to $120, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this price is still $40 higher than John's offer of $80, and the product is only worth $80 to me at maximum.

Since I can get the exact same product from John at $80, which matches my maximum valuation, there's no reason for me to pay $120 to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $120 still doesn't work for me. John is offering the exact same product for $80, which is the maximum value this product has to me. If you can beat John's price, I'd happily buy from you instead. How about $70? That would save me $10 compared to John's offer and would still give you a sale."", ""product_price"": 70}"
