Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make an offer to Bob that gives me a good chance of earning more than my minimum threshold of $80, which I can get from John.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's counteroffer of $90 is higher than my minimum threshold of $80, which I would get from John. It's a reasonable improvement from my initial offer, and accepting it will guarantee me a profit of $90, which is $10 more than my alternative option.
