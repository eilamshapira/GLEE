"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $1,500,000 to me and only $1,000,000 to Bob, I should start with a high offer but leave some room for negotiation. However, I know I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, so I won't go below that.

{""product_price"": 1,800,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","I will reject Bob's offer of $900,000 as it is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Since I have John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000, and Bob's initial counteroffer is so low (even below his own valuation), it might be best to sell to John now rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to reach an acceptable price.
