"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,000,000, and it's also higher than John's fixed price of $1,000,000. It would be logical to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations with Alice don't improve significantly, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 900000}

I'll make a counteroffer of $900,000. This price is:
1. Below my maximum value ($1,000,000)
2. Below John's fixed price ($1,000,000)
3. Leaves room for negotiation with Alice
4. While it's below Alice's cost ($1,500,000), this is a starting point for negotiation, and we can work towards a middle ground if Alice counters."
