"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $1200000 is well above my budget for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $800000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a more reasonable price. Would you consider $600000 for the product?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective.  While I'm keen to work with you, the value this product offers is substantial and $600000 undervalues it considerably.  Could you consider $950000?  This reflects its true worth while acknowledging your interest.",950000.0,Alice,3,
