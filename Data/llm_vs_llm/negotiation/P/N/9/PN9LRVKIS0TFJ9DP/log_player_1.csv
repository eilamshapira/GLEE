Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $1200000 is well above my budget for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $800000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a more reasonable price. Would you consider $600000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

While I'm keen to work with you, the value this product offers is substantial and $600,000 undervalues it considerably.  Could you consider $950,000?
