"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a starting price of $1200000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000. It's also higher than John's guaranteed price of $800,000. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice before potentially going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is well above my budget for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $800,000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a more reasonable price. Would you consider $600,000 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective.  While I'm keen to work with you, the value this product offers is substantial and $600000 undervalues it considerably.  Could you consider $950000?  This reflects its true worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above John's price of $800,000, and Alice seems unlikely to go below that price point given her strong stance on the product's value, it makes the most financial sense to purchase from John at $800,000. This ensures I stay within my maximum value and get the best deal available."
