"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I have another seller offering a similar product for $8000. I would be interested in buying from you at $6000, which would be a better deal for me. Let me know if this works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $6000 is significantly lower than the value I see in this product. I'm willing to come down to $9000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. This product is truly exceptional, and I think you'll be thrilled with it. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
