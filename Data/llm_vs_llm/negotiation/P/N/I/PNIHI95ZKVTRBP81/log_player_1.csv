"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I have another seller offering a similar product for $8000. I would be interested in buying from you at $6000, which would be a better deal for me. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $6,000 is significantly lower than the value I see in this product. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. This product is truly exceptional, and I think you'll be thrilled with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
