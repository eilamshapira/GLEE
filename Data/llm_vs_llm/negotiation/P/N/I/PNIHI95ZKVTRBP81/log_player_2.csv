"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe is worth a lot to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $15000. This is a great opportunity, and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000, and also higher than John's guaranteed price of $8,000. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I have another seller offering a similar product for $8,000. I would be interested in buying from you at $6,000, which would be a better deal for me. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $6000 is significantly lower than the value I see in this product. I'm willing to come down to $9000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. This product is truly exceptional, and I think you'll be thrilled with it. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer of $9,000 is still above John's guaranteed price of $8,000, and Alice seems resistant to go lower, it makes the most sense to take John's offer. There's no guarantee that Alice will go below $8,000 in future negotiations, and we could waste more rounds only to end up paying more than necessary. John's price of $8,000 matches my maximum value and is the best guaranteed option available."
