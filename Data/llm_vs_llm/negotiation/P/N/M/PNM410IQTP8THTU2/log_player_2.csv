"Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Looking at Alice's offer, she's selling the product for $80. Let me evaluate this:

- The product is worth no more than $80 to me (Bob)
- Alice's offer is $80
- John is also selling the same product for $80

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($80), and this matches the maximum I value the product at, I'm indifferent between buying from either seller. I can accept Alice's offer since there's no price advantage to going with John.
