"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to make a counteroffer of $60. Let me know if it's something you'd be willing to consider.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. While $60 is too low for me, I can offer you a better deal at $120. I believe it's a fair price for the value you're getting. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate the discount, but $120 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $70. I believe it's a reasonable price, and I'm willing to make a deal if we can meet in the middle.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $70 is still too low for me, how about we settle on a price of $110? I believe it's a great compromise that reflects the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts!",110.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $75. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal if we can meet at this point.",75.0,Bob,6,

Hi Bob! Thank you for your continued interest and for your counteroffer. I can see you're trying to find a fair price. How about we settle at $100? It would allow us both to walk away happy with the deal. Let me know what you think!,100.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $100 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Considering John is offering the same product for $80, I'd like to make another counteroffer of $80. If you're willing to match this price, I'd be happy to make a deal with you instead.",80.0,Bob,8,
