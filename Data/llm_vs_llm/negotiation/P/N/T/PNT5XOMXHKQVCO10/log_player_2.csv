"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer ($15,000) is higher than both my maximum valuation ($10,000) and John's fixed price ($10,000), the rational decision is to buy from John. There's no reason to pay $15,000 when I can get the same product for $10,000, and even if I made a counteroffer to Alice, I wouldn't want to pay more than $10,000 anyway."
