"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'm offering for $150. I believe this price reflects its value and potential benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given the information provided, Alice is offering the product for $150, which is significantly higher than its worth to me ($80) and higher than John's offer ($80). 

Since I can buy the exact same product from John for $80, which is the maximum value of the product to me, there's no reason to accept Alice's much higher offer of $150.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is much higher than I can pay for this product. I know that John is selling the same product for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider $70 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 70}"
