I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This gives Bob a good deal while still leaving me a decent profit. I'll be prepared to negotiate further if he rejects the offer, but I'm hoping this is a good starting point."

I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500.  This is still a fair price for me and hopefully acceptable to Bob."
