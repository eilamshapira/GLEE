"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I can't go as low as $100 as this product is worth at least $150 to me. However, I can come down from my initial offer. I'm willing to sell it for $175. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks, Alice. I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $175 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $125?",125.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. However, I need to be transparent that I have another buyer, John, who's willing to pay $150 for this product. That's my absolute minimum. Given that, I can offer you the product for $160, which is still a good value considering what you'll get from it.",160.0,Alice,5,
