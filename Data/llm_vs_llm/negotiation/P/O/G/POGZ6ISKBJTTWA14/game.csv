"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I can offer $60. Would this work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot go that low. I have another buyer willing to pay $80, so I cannot accept anything below that. However, I'm willing to work with you. Given the product's quality, would you consider $120? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer.",120.0,Alice,3,
