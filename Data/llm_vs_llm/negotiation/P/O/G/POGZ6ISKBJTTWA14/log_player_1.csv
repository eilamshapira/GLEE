"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $150. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I can offer $60. Would this work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer. $60 is below my minimum acceptable price, as I can get $80 from John. Let me propose a more reasonable price to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot go that low. I have another buyer willing to pay $80, so I cannot accept anything below that. However, I'm willing to work with you. Given the product's quality, would you consider $120? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 120}"
