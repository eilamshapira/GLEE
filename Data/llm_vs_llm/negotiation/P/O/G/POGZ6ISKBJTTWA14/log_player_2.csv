"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $150. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $150 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $80, and even higher than John's guaranteed price of $80. It's best to reject and make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice, knowing we always have John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I can offer $60. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 60}

I'm starting with a lower offer of $60 to leave room for negotiation, while still being below my maximum value of $80. This way, even if Alice counter-offers with a higher price, we might be able to meet somewhere in the middle that's still below both my maximum value and John's price of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot go that low. I have another buyer willing to pay $80, so I cannot accept anything below that. However, I'm willing to work with you. Given the product's quality, would you consider $120? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Given that Alice mentioned she has another buyer at $80 and is still asking for $120 (which is well above my maximum value), and she's unlikely to go below $80 based on her statement, it's best to take John's guaranteed offer of $80. While we could continue negotiating, Alice's signals suggest she won't go below $80, so there's no point in continuing the negotiation when we can secure the product at our maximum acceptable price from John."
