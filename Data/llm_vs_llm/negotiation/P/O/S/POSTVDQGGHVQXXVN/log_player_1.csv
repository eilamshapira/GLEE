Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Considering my options:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500:** This nets me $8,500, which is above my minimum.
*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer:** I might get a better price, but risk him walking away or me ending up with less.
*   **(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000:** This is my fallback, giving me $8,000.

Given that $8,500 is a reasonable profit, and there's a risk of Bob walking away or trying to lowball me further, I'll go with the sure thing.
