"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $14,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's alternative price ($10,000). It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer when I can either:
1. Make a counteroffer to try to get a better price from Alice
2. Buy from John at $10,000 if negotiations with Alice don't work out

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9000}

I'll offer $9,000 for the product. Here's my reasoning:
1. The product is worth $12,000 to Alice
2. My maximum value is $10,000
3. John's alternative price is $10,000
4. By offering $9,000, I leave room for negotiation while still offering a price that could give Alice a significant portion of the potential gains from trade
5. Even if Alice rejects this offer, I can always go back to John's $10,000 offer

This offer gives Alice a chance to make a sale while allowing me to potentially save money compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll buy from John for $10,000 because:
1. Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above my maximum value ($10,000)
2. John's price ($10,000) is the better option compared to Alice's current offer
3. Given that Alice's product is worth $12,000 to her, it's unlikely she'll go below $10,000 in future negotiations
4. Further negotiation rounds might not lead to a better deal than John's offer

It's most rational to take John's guaranteed $10,000 offer rather than continue negotiations with Alice or accept her above-maximum-value offer."
