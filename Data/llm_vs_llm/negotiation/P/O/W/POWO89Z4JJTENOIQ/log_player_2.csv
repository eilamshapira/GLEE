"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000), it doesn't make sense to accept it. While I could make a counteroffer, I already know that John's price is equal to my maximum value, so there's no guarantee that negotiating with Alice will result in a better deal. The safest and most rational decision is to buy from John.
