"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $15,000
2. Alice's offer is $12,000, which is $3,000 less than John's price
3. I still have 9 more rounds of negotiation possible
4. Since Alice's first offer is already significantly lower than my maximum value, I could try to negotiate for an even better price

Given that Alice's initial offer is already quite reasonable but we have many rounds left to negotiate, I'll reject this offer to try getting an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice opened with $12,000, I'll try to negotiate significantly lower and then we can potentially meet in the middle. I'll offer $9,000, which is $3,000 less than her initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let's analyze the situation:

1. Alice's initial offer was $12,000
2. I countered with $9,000
3. Alice has now come down to $11,000, showing willingness to negotiate
4. This is $4,000 less than John's price
5. There are still 7 rounds left for negotiation
6. Alice has moved $1,000 from her initial position, while I tried to move $3,000

The price of $11,000 is quite good, being $4,000 less than my maximum value. However, since Alice has shown willingness to negotiate and we have several rounds left, I'll try one more round of negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $1,000 from her initial offer to $11,000, I'll move up $1,000 from my previous offer of $9,000. This shows I'm also willing to be reasonable and move towards a middle ground.

{""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let's analyze the current situation:

1. The negotiation has progressed well:
   - Alice started at $12,000
   - I offered $9,000
   - Alice came down to $11,000
   - I offered $10,000
   - Now Alice is offering $10,500

2. This price is:
   - $4,500 less than John's price
   - Only $500 above my last offer
   - Represents a fair middle ground between our last positions

3. Alice has shown consistent willingness to negotiate, but her movements are getting smaller, suggesting we might be reaching her limit.

Given that:
- We've reached a very reasonable price
- The difference from my last offer is relatively small
- There's risk in pushing too hard and potentially losing the good deal we have
- $10,500 represents a significant savings from both the initial offer and John's price

I'll accept this offer.
