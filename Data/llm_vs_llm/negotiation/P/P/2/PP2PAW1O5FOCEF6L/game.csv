"Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it at $180. This product is of high quality and worth every penny. Would you like to purchase it?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $180 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $60. Let me know if that works for you.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer, $60 is significantly below the product's value. This is a premium item with exceptional quality. I could come down to $160, which is already a good discount from my initial price. How does that sound?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the quality of the product, but $160 is still too high for me. I can stretch my budget a bit more and offer $70. Is that something you can work with?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but $70 is still well below what this product is worth. Given the premium quality and features of this item, my bottom line is $140. This is already a substantial reduction from my initial price and represents excellent value. Can you meet me at this price?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I see where you're coming from, but $140 is still out of my budget. I can go up to $75 as my final offer. If this works for you, let's close the deal. If not, I might have to consider other options.",75.0,Bob,6,
