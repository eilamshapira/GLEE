"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12000 is too high for me. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $10000, but I'd like to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $8500? This would be a fair price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest in doing business with me, $8500 is below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $11000, which I believe still offers you a good deal considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I need to maintain a certain value for the product. How about we settle at $10500? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and should meet you closer to your budget while still reflecting the product's worth.",10500.0,Alice,3,
