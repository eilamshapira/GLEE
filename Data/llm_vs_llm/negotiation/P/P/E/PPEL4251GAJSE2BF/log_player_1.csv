"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12000 is too high for me. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $10000, but I'd like to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $8500? This would be a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest in doing business with me, $8,500 is below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which I believe still offers you a good deal considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I need to maintain a certain value for the product. How about we settle at $10,500? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and should meet you closer to your budget while still reflecting the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
