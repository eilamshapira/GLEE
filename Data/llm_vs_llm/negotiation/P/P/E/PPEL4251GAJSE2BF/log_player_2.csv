"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rational: Alice's offer of $12,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000). There's no reason to accept this offer. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, as I might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice than John's $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12,000 is too high for me. I know I can get this product elsewhere for $10,000, but I'd like to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $8,500? This would be a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Rational: I'm starting with a lower offer ($8,500) to leave room for negotiation. I'm mentioning the alternative price of $10,000 to establish a ceiling for negotiations while trying to get a better deal. This approach is transparent but also aims to save money compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I need to maintain a certain value for the product. How about we settle at $10500? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and should meet you closer to your budget while still reflecting the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Rational: At this point, Alice's offer ($10,500) is still above John's price ($10,000), and since $10,000 is my maximum value for the product, there's no reason to continue negotiating. Alice has moved down significantly from her initial offer, but she's still not beating or matching John's price. The best economic decision is to buy from John at $10,000, which both saves money and ensures I don't exceed my maximum value for the product."
