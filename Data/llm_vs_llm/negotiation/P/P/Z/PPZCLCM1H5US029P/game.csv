"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot go as low as $100. The quality and value of this product justify a higher price. However, I can reduce my initial asking price to $135. This is a fair compromise given the product's worth. Would this work for you?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $135 is still above what I'm willing to pay. Could you consider lowering it to $110? I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
