Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think would interest you. I'm offering it for $150. This is a fair price considering its quality and value. Would you like to purchase it?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and even below John's guaranteed offer, I'll reject it and make a counteroffer. I know the product is worth $120 to Bob, so there should be room for negotiation between $120 and my initial ask of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot go as low as $100. The quality and value of this product justify a higher price. However, I can reduce my initial asking price to $135. This is a fair compromise given the product's worth. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 135}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $135 is still above what I'm willing to pay. Could you consider lowering it to $110? I think that would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $110 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $120, and Bob seems reluctant to meet my minimum acceptable price, I'll take the sure deal with John. This ensures I get my minimum price without further negotiation uncertainty."
