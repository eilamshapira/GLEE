"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in the product and would be willing to pay $60 for it. Let me know if this works for you.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $130. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for getting back to me, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still quite high for me. How about $70? I believe this could be a fair deal for both of us.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your persistence. I appreciate your offer of $70, but I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer, but actually I can offer the product to you for the lowest price I can afford. I can offer the product to you for $100. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",100.0,Alice,5,
