"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I have a great product I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Given Bob's counteroffer of $60, and my minimum acceptable price of $80, I need to decide. Selling to Bob at $60 would mean a loss.

My best option is to reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate it. However, $60 is too low for me. How about $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming back with another offer, Alice. $140 is still a bit high for me. I can go up to $70. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob is offering $70 now. Again, this is below my minimum acceptable price. I need to decide between a counteroffer and selling to John. I still think I can get a better price from Bob, so I'll try one more counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I still think you'd really benefit from this product! How about we meet in the middle at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $130 is still beyond what I'm willing to spend. I can increase my offer to $75. Is that something you can work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob is now offering $75. This is better, but still below my minimum. However, we're getting into later rounds. I need to consider John's offer of $80. I also have fewer rounds left.

At this point, I think I have a good chance of closing the deal for more than $80 if I sell to John.
