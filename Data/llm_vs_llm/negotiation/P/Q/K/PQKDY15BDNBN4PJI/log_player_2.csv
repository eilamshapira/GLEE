"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to evaluate my options carefully. 

Option 1: Accept Alice's offer at $1,000,000
Option 2: Reject and make a counteroffer
Option 3: Buy from John at $1,000,000

Since Alice's price is exactly the same as John's price ($1,000,000), and it's also exactly my maximum valuation, there's no benefit in accepting Alice's current offer. I should try to negotiate a better price with Alice by making a counteroffer. If negotiations fail, I can always fall back on John's offer which matches my maximum budget.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer significantly below Alice's price to leave room for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has reduced her offer from $1,000,000 to $900,000, which is a significant improvement. This is now $100,000 less than John's price of $1,000,000. I could continue negotiating, but I've already secured a substantial discount. If I push too hard, Alice might not continue lowering the price, and I still have the product worth up to $1,000,000 to me.

Given that Alice has shown willingness to reduce the price significantly, I'll accept this offer at $900,000, which saves me $100,000 compared to buying from John.
