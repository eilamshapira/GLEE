"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I notice that Alice's offer is $200, which is significantly higher than my reservation value of $80. It's not a good deal for me.

I could either buy from John immediately for $80, which is the most I'm willing to pay, or try negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a better price.

Since I have 10 rounds available for negotiation and there's no cost to continuing the conversation, I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I can always fall back to John's $80 offer later if needed.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has reduced her offer from $200 to $170, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $170 is still well above my reservation value of $80, and I can get the exact same product from John for $80.

Since Alice is moving in the right direction but her offer is still too high, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

Since Alice's offers are still well above my alternative option, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. I'll try to move us closer to an agreement.
