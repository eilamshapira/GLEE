"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $2,500,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the product holds significant value, but my budget is limited. I'd like to propose a price of $600000, which I believe is more aligned with my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and even lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have 8 rounds left to try to get a better deal from Bob. 

My next message will be: 
""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $600,000 is too low. I'm willing to make a concession, but I need to get closer to the product's true value. I'll make a new offer in the next round."""
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, as I mentioned earlier, I'm willing to make a concession, but I need to get closer to the product's true value. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to lower my initial price. I'd like to propose a new price of $2,200,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. I'm still open to negotiations, but I hope we can meet somewhere in the middle."", ""product_price"": 2200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make adjustments to the price. My budget is quite tight, and I'm really looking to stay as close as possible to $800000. How about we settle on $700000? I believe this could be a fair middle ground for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $700,000 is still significantly lower than my initial price and even lower than what John is willing to pay. I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have 6 rounds left to try to get a better deal from Bob.

It's worth noting that Bob mentioned his budget is around $800,000, which is a useful piece of information. I'll take this into consideration when making my next offer.

My next message will aim to get closer to Bob's budget while still trying to maximize my earnings."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for sharing your budget constraints with me. I understand that you're looking to stay close to $800,000. Considering the product's value and your budget, I'm willing to make a significant concession. I'd like to propose a new price of $1,800,000, which is still a bit above your budget, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth. However, I'm open to further negotiations and willing to consider alternative options."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. While I truly appreciate the value you place on this product, I need to stay within my budget constraints. How about we settle at $800000? It's a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a reasonable offer considering the circumstances. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $800,000 is still lower than what John is willing to pay. Since I have the option to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I will not sell to John yet, as I want to try to get a better deal from Bob.

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have 4 rounds left to try to get a better deal from Bob.

My next message will aim to get closer to a mutually acceptable price, considering Bob's budget constraints and my own minimum acceptable price.

It's worth noting that Bob has reached his initially mentioned budget, so it's unlikely he will go much higher. I'll need to carefully consider my next move to maximize my earnings."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. Considering your budget constraints and my own minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to make a significant concession. I'd like to propose a new price of $1,400,000, which is closer to your budget than my previous offers. However, I'm still open to further negotiations and willing to consider alternative options. Please let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

I've lowered my price to $1,400,000, which is closer to John's offer of $1,500,000. This way, I'm still trying to get a better deal from Bob, but I'm also being more realistic about the price. If Bob rejects this offer, I may need to consider selling to John or making an even lower counteroffer."
