"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since the product is worth no less than $100 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer of $100, I'll start with a higher price to test Bob's willingness to pay.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $60 is well below both my minimum acceptable price ($100) and even below his own value for the product ($80), I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer. I still have 8 rounds left and can always sell to John for $100 if negotiations with Bob fail.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still keep it above my minimum acceptable price of $100, trying to find a middle ground.

{""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer of $70 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100. Since Bob's offers are increasing very slowly and remain below even his own value ($80), it's best to end the negotiation and take John's offer.
