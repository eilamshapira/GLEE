"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $300 is far too high for me. The product is worth no more than $80 to me, and I can actually purchase a similar product from John for exactly $80. I'd be willing to pay $50 for your product if you can meet that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $50 is much too low for me, considering its value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum. How about $275?"", ""product_price"": 275}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $275 is still much higher than what I can pay. As I mentioned, the product is only worth $80 to me at most, and I already have an option to buy it from John at that price. To make it worth buying from you instead of John, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $60 for it. This would save me some money compared to John's offer, and you'd make a sale today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I simply can't go that low. I value the product much higher than $60. How about we meet in the middle a bit more? My rock bottom offer is $250."", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but I need to be clear that I cannot pay more than $80 for it, as that's my maximum budget and the exact price John is offering. I appreciate you trying to find middle ground, but there's quite a large gap between our valuations. I can go up to $70 as my final offer, which would still save me a bit compared to John's price. If we can't reach an agreement near this price, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
