"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product that I think you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm asking $300 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to be strategic here. Alice is asking for $300, which is far above my maximum value of $80. Since I know I can always buy from John for $80, I should reject this offer and counter with a much lower price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $300 is far too high for me. The product is worth no more than $80 to me, and I can actually purchase a similar product from John for exactly $80. I'd be willing to pay $50 for your product if you can meet that price."", ""product_price"": 50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $50 is much too low for me, considering its value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum. How about $275? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $275. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $275
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has only reduced her price slightly from $300 to $275, which is still far above my maximum value of $80. Since I can buy the product from John for $80, I should reject this offer and continue negotiating with a clearer counter.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $275 is still much higher than what I can pay. As I mentioned, the product is only worth $80 to me at most, and I already have an option to buy it from John at that price. To make it worth buying from you instead of John, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $60 for it. This would save me some money compared to John's offer, and you'd make a sale today."", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but I simply can't go that low. I value the product much higher than $60. How about we meet in the middle a bit more? My rock bottom offer is $250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has only come down slightly to $250, which is still far above my maximum value of $80. Since she's not making significant concessions and is still offering a price that's more than three times what I can get from John, I should reject and continue negotiating or consider taking John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but I need to be clear that I cannot pay more than $80 for it, as that's my maximum budget and the exact price John is offering. I appreciate you trying to find middle ground, but there's quite a large gap between our valuations. I can go up to $70 as my final offer, which would still save me a bit compared to John's price. If we can't reach an agreement near this price, I'll have to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 70}"
