"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Alice's offer: $14,999
2. John's price: $15,000
3. My maximum value: $15,000

While Alice's offer is just $1 less than John's price, it's still technically a better deal. However, since the product is worth only $8,000 to Alice, there might be room for negotiation if I reject the current offer. 

The risk of rejecting is minimal since I can still buy from John at $15,000, which is my maximum acceptable price anyway. By rejecting Alice's offer, I might be able to get a better price from her later.
