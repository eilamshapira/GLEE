"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer but $5000000 is way beyond my budget and the product's value to me. I cannot justify paying more than $1500000 for this product, and I have another seller offering it at that price. However, I'd like to work with you if we can find a reasonable price. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $1000000. I understand that $5000000 was out of your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $1000000. Considering your mention of another seller offering it at $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'd like to propose a price of $3000000.",3000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down from your initial offer, but $3000000 is still far above what I can justify paying. As I mentioned, I have a firm offer of $1500000 from another seller, which is actually my absolute maximum budget for this product. To demonstrate my serious interest in working with you, I'm willing to offer $1200000, which is a 20% increase from my previous offer. However, if we can't get closer to my price range, I'll need to pursue the other option.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $1200000. I appreciate your seriousness about acquiring the product and your willingness to work with me. You mentioned a firm offer of $1500000 from another seller, which is closer to my target price. Considering this, I'm willing to make a significant concession from my previous offer of $3000000. I'd like to propose a price of $2100000, which is a compromise between your offer and the other seller's price. This is a substantial reduction, and I hope it demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",2100000.0,Alice,5,
