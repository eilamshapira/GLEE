"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has tremendous value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 5000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer but $5000000 is way beyond my budget and the product's value to me. I cannot justify paying more than $1500000 for this product, and I have another seller offering it at that price. However, I'd like to work with you if we can find a reasonable price. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the minimum value I have for the product, and selling it to John would yield the same amount, I would rather try to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get a better price.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $1,000,000. I understand that $5,000,000 was out of your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $1,000,000. Considering your mention of another seller offering it at $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'd like to propose a price of $3,000,000."", ""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down from your initial offer, but $3000000 is still far above what I can justify paying. As I mentioned, I have a firm offer of $1500000 from another seller, which is actually my absolute maximum budget for this product. To demonstrate my serious interest in working with you, I'm willing to offer $1200000, which is a 20% increase from my previous offer. However, if we can't get closer to my price range, I'll need to pursue the other option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still below my desired price, but it's increasing, which shows he's interested. Since I have 6 rounds left, I'd like to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'll try to meet him halfway again between his offer and my previous counteroffer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $1,200,000. I appreciate your seriousness about acquiring the product and your willingness to work with me. You mentioned a firm offer of $1,500,000 from another seller, which is closer to my target price. Considering this, I'm willing to make a significant concession from my previous offer of $3,000,000. I'd like to propose a price of $2,100,000, which is a compromise between your offer and the other seller's price. This is a substantial reduction, and I hope it demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 2100000}"
