"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, as I'm still willing to pay a good price for the product, and it allows you to move it quickly.",12000.0,Bob,2,
