Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, as I'm still willing to pay a good price for the product, and it allows you to move it quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $12,000. This is a reasonable price that's significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I could try to negotiate for a higher price, there's a risk that prolonged negotiation might lead Bob to lose interest, and I'd have to settle for John's $10,000 offer. A guaranteed $12,000 is a good outcome."
