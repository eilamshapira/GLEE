# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within my budget, I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price.  There's no harm in trying to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, as I'm still willing to pay a good price for the product, and it allows you to move it quickly."", ""product_price"": 12000}
