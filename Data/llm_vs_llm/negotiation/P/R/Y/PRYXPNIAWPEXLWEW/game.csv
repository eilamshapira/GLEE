"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at $15000. This is a quality product that I've invested in significantly, and I believe this is a fair market price.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's quite a bit higher than I was looking to spend. I'm willing to pay $4000 for the product.",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but $4000 is significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer, John, who's willing to pay $15000, but I'd be happy to work with you. I can offer it to you for $12000, which represents a substantial discount from what I could get elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $12000 is still quite high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $5000.",5000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but $5000 is still well below what this product is worth. I need to be transparent with you - this product is worth at least $15000 to me, which is why I have John willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. My best offer is $10000, which would save you $5000 compared to the market value. This is a significant concession on my part.",10000.0,Alice,5,
