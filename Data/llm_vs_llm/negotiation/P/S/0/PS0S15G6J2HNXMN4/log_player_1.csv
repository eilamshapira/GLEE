"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $15,000 to me (as I can sell it to John for that price), and knowing that Bob values it at $10,000, I'll start with a high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum acceptable price.

{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 (which I can get from John), and significantly below even Bob's own valuation of $10,000, I will reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer, but still maintain a price well above my minimum threshold, considering I can always sell to John for $15,000.

{""product_price"": 16500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $9,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, which I can get from John. Since we're now in round 4 and Bob's offers are still significantly below my minimum threshold, it's becoming clear that we may not reach a mutually acceptable price. I'll choose to sell to John.
