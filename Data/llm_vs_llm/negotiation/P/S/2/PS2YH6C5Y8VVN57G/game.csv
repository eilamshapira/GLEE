"Thank you for your offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit higher than I was expecting to pay. I'm looking to spend no more than $100. Can you do any better? How about $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking to spend around $70, I need to point out that the product's quality and market value justify a higher price. My absolute minimum is $100, as I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay that amount. However, since we're already in negotiations, I can offer it to you for $120, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. This is truly a fair deal considering the product's value.",120.0,Alice,3,
