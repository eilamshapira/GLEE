"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit higher than I was expecting to pay. I'm looking to spend no more than $100. Can you do any better? How about $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking to spend around $70, I need to point out that the product's quality and market value justify a higher price. My absolute minimum is $100, as I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay that amount. However, since we're already in negotiations, I can offer it to you for $120, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. This is truly a fair deal considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 120}"
