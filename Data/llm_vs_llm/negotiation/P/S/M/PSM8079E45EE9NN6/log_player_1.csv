Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let's start the negotiation."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $50 because it's significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $150. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be out of your budget, but $50 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 175}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $175 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer, hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $65 because it's still far below the minimum value I have for the product, which is $150. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to see a more significant increase in Bob's offer to consider it seriously. I'll make another counteroffer to try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $65 is still a long way from what I'm looking for. I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to see a more substantial move from your side. Let's try to get closer to a fair price."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand that we're still far apart, but I'm trying to be reasonable. I've increased my offer slightly, hoping we can start to close the gap. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $75 because it's still significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $150. Although Bob has increased his offer, the gap between his offer and my desired price is still substantial. I'll make another counteroffer, but I'm starting to consider selling to John for $150 if Bob's offers don't improve substantially."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate the slight increase in your offer, but $75 is still far from what I'm willing to accept. I'm starting to think that we might not be able to reach a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm willing to give it one more try. I'll meet you halfway between my previous offer and your last offer."", ""product_price"": 157.5}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $157.5 is still significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to make a more substantial increase in my offer, hoping we can finally reach an agreement. If not, I may need to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

I've decided to sell the product to John for $150. Although Bob has increased his offer, the gap between his offer and my desired price is still too large, and I don't think we can reach a mutually agreeable price. With only two rounds left, I don't want to risk not selling the product for a price that I'm comfortable with. Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a fair price, and I'm willing to accept that rather than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
