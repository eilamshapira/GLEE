"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $150 maximum to me
2. Alice's offer is $140, which is below my maximum value
3. Alice revealed the product is worth ""a lot"" to her, but I know it's actually worth $100 to her
4. I can get it for $150 from John, but that's my worst-case scenario
5. There's room for negotiation since Alice has a $40 margin ($140 - $100)

Given this is the first round and we have 9 more rounds to negotiate, I should reject this offer and try to get a better price. Alice's starting price of $140 is too close to my maximum value, and there's significant room for negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably above Alice's cost but significantly below her initial offer, leaving room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $140 is quite high for me. Given the market conditions, I think $115 would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. $115 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $125? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has significantly dropped her price from $140 to $125
2. This is a $15 reduction from her initial offer
3. The price is still $25 above her cost ($100)
4. The price is $25 below my maximum value ($150)
5. Alice is showing willingness to negotiate and has made a substantial move

This is actually a pretty good offer. While there might be a small room for further negotiation, the risks of pushing too hard include:
- Alice might become less flexible
- We might waste rounds and end up with a worse deal
- We could lose momentum in the negotiation

Given that $125 represents a fair middle ground between her cost ($100) and my maximum value ($150), and it's a significant reduction from her initial offer, I should accept this offer.
