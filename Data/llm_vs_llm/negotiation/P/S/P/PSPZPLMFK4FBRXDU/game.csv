"Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. It's a high-quality item with significant value. I'm starting the negotiation at $300. What do you think?",300.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $300 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $60 for this product. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $300 might be a bit high. However, $60 is far too low for this product. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $250.",250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $250 is still too high for me. I can go up to $70, which is already stretching my budget. Let's see if we can make this work.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $70 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I really want to make a deal with you. I can offer it for $220, and that's as low as I'm willing to go for now. Think about the value you're getting.",220.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $220 is still out of my price range. I can increase my offer to $75, but that's the highest I can go. Let me know if this works for you.",75.0,Bob,6,
