,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $17000 is a bit out of my budget. How about we settle on $13000?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $13000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15500?  That's still a great deal for a product that's worth so much.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $15500 is still a bit high for me. How about we try $14000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $14000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $15000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a good profit.",15000.0,Alice,5,
