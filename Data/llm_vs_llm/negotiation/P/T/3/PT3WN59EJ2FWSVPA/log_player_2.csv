"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $175. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to evaluate this offer carefully:

The product is worth $150 to me, meaning I shouldn't pay more than that.
Alice is offering the product for $175, which exceeds my valuation.
John is willing to sell me the same product for $150, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since I want to save as much money as possible while still acquiring the product, and Alice's offer exceeds my valuation, the logical choice is to buy from John at $150.
