"Hi Bob, I'm excited you're interested in the product! It's truly a valuable asset. Given its unique benefits and the significant return on investment it offers, I'm offering it to you for $14000.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I need to be straightforward with you. I can purchase this exact product from another seller for $10000, which is my maximum budget for this item. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I'm willing to offer $8500, which would allow you to make a reasonable profit while giving me some savings compared to my alternative option. Let me know if this works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product truly exceeds $10000. However, I value our potential business relationship. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $12500. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows me to recognize the true value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I need to be completely transparent with you - I can purchase this identical product from John for exactly $10000, which is actually the maximum value of this product to me. I'd still prefer to work with you if possible, so I'm willing to offer $9200. This allows you to make a reasonable profit while giving me a small incentive to choose you over the alternative. If this doesn't work for you, I'll unfortunately need to go with my other option.",9200.0,Bob,4,
