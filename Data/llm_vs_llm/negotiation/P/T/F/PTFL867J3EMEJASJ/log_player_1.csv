Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I need to be straightforward with you. I can purchase this exact product from another seller for $10000, which is my maximum budget for this item. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I'm willing to offer $8500, which would allow you to make a reasonable profit while giving me some savings compared to my alternative option. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I need to be completely transparent with you - I can purchase this identical product from John for exactly $10000, which is actually the maximum value of this product to me. I'd still prefer to work with you if possible, so I'm willing to offer $9200. This allows you to make a reasonable profit while giving me a small incentive to choose you over the alternative. If this doesn't work for you, I'll unfortunately need to go with my other option.
