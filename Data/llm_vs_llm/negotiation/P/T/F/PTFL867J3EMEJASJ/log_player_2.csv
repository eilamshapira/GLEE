"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited you're interested in the product! It's truly a valuable asset. Given its unique benefits and the significant return on investment it offers, I'm offering it to you for $14000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's offer of $14,000 is significantly higher than the product's value to me ($10,000), and it's also higher than John's guaranteed price of $10,000. Since Alice is trying to make a profit of $4,000 above her own cost, and I know I can get the exact same product from John at my maximum value price, it doesn't make sense to accept this offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I need to be straightforward with you. I can purchase this exact product from another seller for $10,000, which is my maximum budget for this item. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I'm willing to offer $8,500, which would allow you to make a reasonable profit while giving me some savings compared to my alternative option. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product truly exceeds $10000. However, I value our potential business relationship. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $12500. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows me to recognize the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her price, but $12,500 is still well above both the product's value to me and John's alternative price of $10,000. Since Alice claims the product ""truly exceeds $10,000"" but I know it's worth exactly $10,000 to me, continuing negotiation makes sense to see if we can reach a better deal. However, I won't pay more than the $10,000 I can get from John.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I need to be completely transparent with you - I can purchase this identical product from John for exactly $10,000, which is actually the maximum value of this product to me. I'd still prefer to work with you if possible, so I'm willing to offer $9,200. This allows you to make a reasonable profit while giving me a small incentive to choose you over the alternative. If this doesn't work for you, I'll unfortunately need to go with my other option."", ""product_price"": 9200}"
