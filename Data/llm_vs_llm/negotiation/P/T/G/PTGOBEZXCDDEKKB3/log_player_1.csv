Send your offer to Bob.,"After analyzing the situation, I'll make my offer to Bob.

Since I know the product is worth $800,000 to Bob and $1,500,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, there's no reason for me to offer the product to Bob at any price below $1,500,000. If Bob rejects the offer (which is likely since the price is above his valuation), I can still sell to John at my minimum acceptable price.
