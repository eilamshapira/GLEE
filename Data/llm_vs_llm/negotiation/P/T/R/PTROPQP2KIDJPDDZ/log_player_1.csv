Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob
2. My minimum acceptable price is $800,000
3. If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed $800,000 from John
4. Bob will likely accept any price that gives him some value (below $1,500,000)
5. I should aim to capture most, but not all, of Bob's surplus to maximize my chances

I'll offer a price that leaves some value for Bob but is significantly higher than my minimum:

{""product_price"": 1300000}

This price:
- Gives Bob $200,000 in value ($1.5M - $1.3M)
- Gives me $500,000 more than my fallback option
- Is likely to be accepted as it's still beneficial for Bob
- Captures most of the available surplus"
