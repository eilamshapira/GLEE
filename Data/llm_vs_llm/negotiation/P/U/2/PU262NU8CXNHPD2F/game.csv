"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but I'm thinking more in the range of $50.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $50 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $120? That's still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $120 is still more than I can afford. How about $70?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $70 is just not feasible for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price considering the product's value.",95.0,Alice,5,
