"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice is offering the product for $100, which is more than both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80), it wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. I have two remaining options:

1. Make a counteroffer to Alice
2. Buy from John for $80

Since John's price ($80) equals my maximum value, there's no room for getting a better deal. Even if I make a counteroffer to Alice, I won't be able to get it for less than $80 (since that's Alice's cost). Therefore, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
