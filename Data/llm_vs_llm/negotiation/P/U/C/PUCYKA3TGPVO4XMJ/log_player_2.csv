"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $121. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $121. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $121
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $121
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $100
4. If I buy from Alice at $121, I'll be paying $21 more than my maximum valuation
5. If I buy from John at $100, I'll be paying exactly what the product is worth to me

Since Alice's offer ($121) is above my maximum valuation ($100) and there's a better alternative available from John ($100), the logical choice is to buy from John.
