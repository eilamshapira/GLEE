"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $10000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to meet me at this price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. However, I can't go as low as $6000. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? Let me know if that works for you!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $7500. I believe this is a reasonable price, and I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to meet me at this price.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand where you're coming from, but I cannot accept $7500. How about $8500? I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",8500.0,Alice,5,
