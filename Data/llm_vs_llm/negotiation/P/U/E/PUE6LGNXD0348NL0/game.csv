"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has tremendous value, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its worth.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I must point out that your asking price of $1500000 is significantly above market value. I'm aware that John is offering the same product for $1000000, which is already the maximum value this product holds for me. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation. I can offer you $800000 for the product, which would give me some savings compared to John's offer while still providing you with a substantial amount.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $800000. I understand your point about the market value, but I must emphasize that this product holds a unique value to me, and I'm looking for a price that reflects its true worth. Considering your interest in the product and the fact that you're willing to pay more than John's offer, I'm willing to make a concession. However, I still need to ensure that I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering with a price of $1200000, which is a compromise from my initial offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that you value the product highly, but I need to be clear that I have a firm alternative from John at $1000000. This represents the maximum value of the product to me. To make this deal work between us, I need a price that gives me some benefit over my alternative. I can offer you $900000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and would allow me to justify doing business with you rather than John. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while giving me some advantage for choosing to work with you.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $900000. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid, and I'm glad we're moving closer to a potential agreement. However, I still need to ensure that I'm getting a fair price for the product, considering its value to me and the alternative offer from John. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to balance my desire to close the deal with you against the certainty of selling it to John for $1000000. With that in mind, I'm counteroffering with a price of $1050000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to find common ground. However, I need to emphasize that John's offer of $1000000 represents both the maximum I'm willing to pay and the product's maximum value to me. There's no scenario where paying more than $1000000 makes economic sense for me. In fact, to justify the time we're spending on this negotiation, I need to achieve some savings compared to John's price. My offer of $950000 represents a fair compromise - you would get most of the product's value, and I would achieve a modest saving that makes this negotiation worthwhile. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $1000000, I'll have no choice but to proceed with John's offer.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $950000. I understand your position and the need to achieve some savings compared to John's offer. I appreciate your honesty about the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a significant concession to try and close the deal. Considering your constraints and my desire to find a mutually beneficial price, I'm counteroffering with a price of $975000. This price reflects a substantial compromise from my initial offer and is closer to the maximum value you've indicated the product holds for you. I believe this offer strikes a fair balance between your needs and mine, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal at this price.",975000.0,Alice,7,
