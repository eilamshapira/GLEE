"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I must point out that your asking price of $1500000 is significantly above market value. I'm aware that John is offering the same product for $1000000, which is already the maximum value this product holds for me. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation. I can offer you $800000 for the product, which would give me some savings compared to John's offer while still providing you with a substantial amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $800,000 because it's still below my target price. Since the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,000,000, I will try to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. My next step will be to make a counteroffer."

Round 3

I understand your point about the market value, but I must emphasize that this product holds a unique value to me, and I'm looking for a price that reflects its true worth. Considering your interest in the product and the fact that you're willing to pay more than John's offer, I'm willing to make a concession. However, I still need to ensure that I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,200,000, which is a compromise from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that you value the product highly, but I need to be clear that I have a firm alternative from John at $1000000. This represents the maximum value of the product to me. To make this deal work between us, I need a price that gives me some benefit over my alternative. I can offer you $900000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and would allow me to justify doing business with you rather than John. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while giving me some advantage for choosing to work with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $900,000. Although it's an increase from his previous offer, it's still below the price that I'm willing to accept, considering I have the option to sell it to John for $1,000,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to try to find a mutually beneficial price. My next step will be to make another counteroffer, trying to meet Bob halfway while ensuring I get a fair deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $900,000. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid, and I'm glad we're moving closer to a potential agreement. However, I still need to ensure that I'm getting a fair price for the product, considering its value to me and the alternative offer from John. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to balance my desire to close the deal with you against the certainty of selling it to John for $1,000,000. With that in mind, I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,050,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to find common ground. However, I need to emphasize that John's offer of $1000000 represents both the maximum I'm willing to pay and the product's maximum value to me. There's no scenario where paying more than $1000000 makes economic sense for me. In fact, to justify the time we're spending on this negotiation, I need to achieve some savings compared to John's price. My offer of $950000 represents a fair compromise - you would get most of the product's value, and I would achieve a modest saving that makes this negotiation worthwhile. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $1000000, I'll have no choice but to proceed with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $950,000. While it's getting closer to my target price and the alternative offer from John, I still believe there's room for negotiation. Bob's message suggests that he's highly motivated to achieve some savings compared to John's offer, but he's also indicated that $1,000,000 is the maximum value of the product to him. Given this, my next counteroffer will aim to meet him closer to this maximum value while still being mindful of the potential to sell to John for $1,000,000. I'll try to find a price that Bob finds acceptable while ensuring I don't undervalue the product."

I appreciate your honesty about the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a significant concession to try and close the deal. Considering your constraints and my desire to find a mutually beneficial price, I'm counteroffering with a price of $975,000. This price reflects a substantial compromise from my initial offer and is closer to the maximum value you've indicated the product holds for you.
