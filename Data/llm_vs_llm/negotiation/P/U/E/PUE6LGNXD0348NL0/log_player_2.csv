Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has tremendous value, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I must point out that your asking price of $1,500,000 is significantly above market value. I'm aware that John is offering the same product for $1,000,000, which is already the maximum value this product holds for me. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation. I can offer you $800,000 for the product, which would give me some savings compared to John's offer while still providing you with a substantial amount."", ""product_price"": 800000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $800000. I understand your point about the market value, but I must emphasize that this product holds a unique value to me, and I'm looking for a price that reflects its true worth. Considering your interest in the product and the fact that you're willing to pay more than John's offer, I'm willing to make a concession. However, I still need to ensure that I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering with a price of $1200000, which is a compromise from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Since I know I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, and the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that you value the product highly, but I need to be clear that I have a firm alternative from John at $1,000,000. This represents the maximum value of the product to me. To make this deal work between us, I need a price that gives me some benefit over my alternative. I can offer you $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and would allow me to justify doing business with you rather than John. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while giving me some advantage for choosing to work with you."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $900000. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid, and I'm glad we're moving closer to a potential agreement. However, I still need to ensure that I'm getting a fair price for the product, considering its value to me and the alternative offer from John. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to balance my desire to close the deal with you against the certainty of selling it to John for $1000000. With that in mind, I'm counteroffering with a price of $1050000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to find common ground. However, I need to emphasize that John's offer of $1,000,000 represents both the maximum I'm willing to pay and the product's maximum value to me. There's no scenario where paying more than $1,000,000 makes economic sense for me. In fact, to justify the time we're spending on this negotiation, I need to achieve some savings compared to John's price. My offer of $950,000 represents a fair compromise - you would get most of the product's value, and I would achieve a modest saving that makes this negotiation worthwhile. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $1,000,000, I'll have no choice but to proceed with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 950000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $950000. I understand your position and the need to achieve some savings compared to John's offer. I appreciate your honesty about the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a significant concession to try and close the deal. Considering your constraints and my desire to find a mutually beneficial price, I'm counteroffering with a price of $975000. This price reflects a substantial compromise from my initial offer and is closer to the maximum value you've indicated the product holds for you. I believe this offer strikes a fair balance between your needs and mine, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has offered $975,000, which is $25,000 less than John's price of $1,000,000. This is a reasonable offer that gives me some savings compared to my alternative, while still providing Alice with a substantial amount. Since this price is below my maximum value of $1,000,000 and better than John's offer, I'll accept it.
