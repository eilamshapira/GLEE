"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,200,000. This is a competitive price for the product's capabilities and potential return on investment. Would you be interested in proceeding with this offer?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm looking to make a more cost-effective investment. Would you consider selling the product for $900000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. While Bob's offer of $900,000 is better than John's guaranteed $800,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but given the product's value and capabilities, I cannot go that low. However, I'm willing to be flexible. I can offer the product for $1,050,000, which represents a significant reduction from my initial price and reflects a fair market value. This price takes into account both the product's intrinsic worth and your interest in making a cost-effective investment."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
