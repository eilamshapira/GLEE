"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this exclusive product. Considering its unique features and potential benefits, I'm offering it to you for:  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $20,000
3. John is offering the same product for $8,000

The logical choice is to buy from John since:
- Alice's price ($20,000) is significantly higher than my maximum valuation ($8,000)
- John's price ($8,000) matches my maximum valuation
- Buying from Alice would mean overpaying by $12,000
