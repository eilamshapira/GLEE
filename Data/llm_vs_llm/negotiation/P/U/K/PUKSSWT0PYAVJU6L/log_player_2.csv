"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm offering it to you for $10000, which I think is a fair price considering its worth to you. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer compared to my alternatives.

Alice is offering the product for $10,000, which is exactly the same price that John is offering. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, so Alice's price is at my maximum value threshold.

Since both Alice and John are offering the exact same price of $10,000, I have no financial incentive to choose one over the other. In this case, I might as well accept Alice's offer since she's already engaged with me.
