"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its incredible potential, I believe a starting price of $2000000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me
2. Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $1,200,000
4. Even if I make a counteroffer, Alice's initial price is so high that reaching a price below $1,200,000 might be difficult

The logical choice is to:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

This decision is optimal because:
1. It guarantees I get the product at my maximum acceptable price
2. It saves time and effort in negotiations
3. It protects me from potentially paying more than the product is worth to me
4. Alice's initial offer is too far from my acceptable range to make negotiation worthwhile"
