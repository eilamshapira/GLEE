"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $80 is far too low for this product's value. I can offer it to you for $200. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair value considering the product's quality.",200.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks Alice, I understand the value you place on the product. However, $200 is still above what I'm willing to pay. I can offer $100.",100.0,Bob,4,
