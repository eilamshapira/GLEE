"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $1000000 is far below the value of the product. Considering the potential return on investment and the product's unique features, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'll offer it to you for $2300000.",2300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2300000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'll offer $1150000 for the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $2100000 is still significantly above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I need you to meet me closer to my target price. I'll offer $1200000 for the product, which is the highest I'm comfortable paying.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
