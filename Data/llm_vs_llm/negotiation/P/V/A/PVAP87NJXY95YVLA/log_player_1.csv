"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2300000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'll offer $1150000 for the product.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $2100000 is still significantly above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I need you to meet me closer to my target price. I'll offer $1200000 for the product, which is the highest I'm comfortable paying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is tempting, but I know the product's worth to me is $1,500,000. However, this is round 6, and I have to consider the remaining rounds. Since this is my minimum acceptable price, and I am unlikely to get a better offer from Bob, and the possibility of Bob going to the next round and lowering his offer is significant, I will cut my losses and sell the product to John.
