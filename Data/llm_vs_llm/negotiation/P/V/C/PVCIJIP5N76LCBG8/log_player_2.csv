"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is above my maximum value of $8,000, and it's also higher than John's price of $8,000. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer significantly below my maximum value to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be unreasonable.

{""product_price"": 6000}

This counteroffer is reasonable because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $8,000
2. It leaves room for negotiation upward if Alice rejects
3. It's far enough below John's price ($8,000) that it could potentially save me significant money
4. It represents a 40% reduction from Alice's initial offer, which while significant, isn't insulting"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $9,500 is still above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000). While Alice has moved down from her initial offer, this price is still not acceptable. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer somewhat to show willingness to negotiate, but still stay well below John's price.

{""product_price"": 6800}

This counteroffer is strategic because:
1. It shows movement from my previous offer ($6,000), demonstrating I'm willing to negotiate
2. It's still comfortably below my maximum value and John's price of $8,000
3. It leaves room for further negotiation while potentially saving me money compared to John's offer
4. The $800 increase from my last offer shows substantial movement (about 13% increase) to encourage Alice to continue negotiating"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000). While Alice continues to lower her price, there's no reason for me to accept an offer higher than what I can get from John. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 7200}

I'll increase my offer again to show continued good faith in negotiations:
1. This represents a $400 increase from my last offer of $6,800
2. It's still $800 below John's price, giving me potential savings
3. It's getting closer to my maximum value while maintaining room for negotiation
4. The pattern of increasing offers shows I'm serious about reaching a deal
5. If Alice rejects this, I still have the option to go with John's offer, but I'm trying to secure a better deal first"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John because:
1. Alice's latest offer ($8,500) is still above John's price ($8,000)
2. While Alice has been lowering her price, she's still not matching or beating John's offer
3. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and the gap between Alice's offers and John's price remains significant
4. Even if Alice eventually comes down further, there's no guarantee she'll go below $8,000
5. With limited rounds remaining, it's safer to take John's guaranteed $8,000 offer rather than risk running out of negotiation rounds"
