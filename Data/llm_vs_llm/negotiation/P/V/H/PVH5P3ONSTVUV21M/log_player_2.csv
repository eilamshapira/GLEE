"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to consider the best option for buying the product while saving as much money as possible.

Looking at my options:
- Alice is offering the product for $10,000
- John is willing to sell the same product for $8,000
- The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me

Since John's price ($8,000) is lower than Alice's price ($10,000), and the product is worth at most $8,000 to me, the most economical choice would be to buy from John.
