"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $14000 is significantly above my budget and the market value. I know another seller offering this product for $10000, but I'd like to work with you. Given that, I can offer $9000 for the product. This allows you to make a quick sale while giving me a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective on the price. While I'm aiming for a higher price point, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $11500? This reflects the value I believe this product will bring to you, while still acknowledging your budget concerns.",11500.0,Alice,3,
