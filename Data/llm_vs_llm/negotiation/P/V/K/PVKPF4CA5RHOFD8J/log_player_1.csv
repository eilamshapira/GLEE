Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $14000 is significantly above my budget and the market value. I know another seller offering this product for $10000, but I'd like to work with you. Given that, I can offer $9000 for the product. This allows you to make a quick sale while giving me a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
