"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Considering the market value and the fact that I'm willing to make a decision quickly, I believe this price is reasonable.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but I can't accept $10000 as it's below my cost. I have another buyer ready at $12000, but I'd prefer to work with you. I can come down to $13500, which represents a $1000 discount from my initial offer and provides you with significant value given the product's worth.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the other options available to me, I'm willing to meet you in the middle between my previous offer and your current one. I'd like to propose $11250 as a serious offer, taking into account the product's value and my budget.",11250.0,Bob,4,
