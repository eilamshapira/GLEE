Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to start the negotiation with a price that leaves room for potential bargaining but still aims to maximize my profit. Given that the product is worth $15,000 to Bob and $12,000 to me, I'll start with a price closer to Bob's valuation.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $14,500. This is a fair price considering the product's exceptional features and performance."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Considering the market value and the fact that I'm willing to make a decision quickly, I believe this price is reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I need to counter with a price that's more realistic but still above my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. Since Bob started at $10,000 (which is below my minimum), I'll move down from my initial price but remain firm about not going below $12,000.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but I can't accept $10,000 as it's below my cost. I have another buyer ready at $12,000, but I'd prefer to work with you. I can come down to $13,500, which represents a $1,000 discount from my initial offer and provides you with significant value given the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the other options available to me, I'm willing to meet you in the middle between my previous offer and your current one. I'd like to propose $11250 as a serious offer, taking into account the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250.
