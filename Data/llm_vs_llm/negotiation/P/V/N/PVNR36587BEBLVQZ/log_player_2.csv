"Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $3,000,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum budget, I will reject Alice's offer.

Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within my budget. However, I would like to try to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

Therefore, my decision is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I want to save as much money as possible and the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, I will make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.

My counteroffer is: {""product_price"": $500,000}"
