Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. I need to set a price that maximizes my potential profit while considering that I have a guaranteed $80 from John if Bob rejects.

Since I don't know Bob's maximum willingness to pay, I should set a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This way, if Bob accepts, I'll make a good profit, and if he rejects, I still have my $80 fallback with John.

I'll set the price at $120, which is a 50% markup from my minimum price. If Bob's valuation is higher than this, I'll make a good profit. If not, I still have my guaranteed $80 from John.
