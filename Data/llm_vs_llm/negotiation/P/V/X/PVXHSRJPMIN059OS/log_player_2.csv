"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering you a fantastic product that I think you'll really like. You can purchase it for $100. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this logically:

1. The product is worth no more than $150 to me (my maximum value)
2. John's offer of $150 is my fallback option
3. Alice's offer of $100 is significantly below my maximum value and below John's price
4. There's no guarantee I'll get a better price by negotiating further

Alice's initial offer of $100 is quite reasonable - it's $50 less than John's price and provides good value given my maximum valuation of $150. While I could try to negotiate for an even lower price, this is already a good deal, and there's a risk that prolonged negotiation might lead to a less favorable outcome.
