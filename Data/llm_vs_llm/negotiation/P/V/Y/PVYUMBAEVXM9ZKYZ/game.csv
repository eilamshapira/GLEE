"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1100000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential for you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks Alice, but I think $1100000 is a bit steep. I'm looking to stay within my budget. How about we settle for $850000 instead? This way, both of us can walk away from the deal happy.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I understand your desire to stay within budget, $850000 is significantly below its true value and my original asking price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1050000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $925000. This way, we both give a little and get a little.",925000.0,Bob,4,
