Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer is at the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I also have the option to sell it to John for the same price, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll try to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Since Bob offered $80, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my initial offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer of $90 is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with. Since it's still lower than my initial offer and my previous counteroffer, I'll consider accepting it. However, I'll also think about the fact that I can sell it to John for $80, which is $10 less than Bob's offer.

Considering the options, I think Bob's offer of $90 is reasonable, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by making another counteroffer.
