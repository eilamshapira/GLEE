Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a reasonably high price to leave room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Given that Bob's offer is exactly the same as my minimum acceptable price (and John's offer), there's no advantage in accepting it. I can try to negotiate for a better price, knowing I always have the $120 backup option with John.

Let me counter with a new offer of $150.
