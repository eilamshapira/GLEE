"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's new offer of $150 is exactly at my maximum budget, and I also have the option to buy the product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in continuing to negotiate with Alice. In this case, I might as well accept Alice's offer, as it doesn't make a difference in terms of price whether I buy from Alice or John.
