"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique qualities and the benefits it offers, I'm initially pricing it at $15000. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I need to be upfront that it's only worth about $6000 to me. Additionally, I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $8000. Since I'm interested in working with you, I'm offering $6000, which gives me some value while allowing you to make a sale. Let me know if this works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your honesty and the information about John's offer. I understand your perspective. However, $6000 is lower than I can accept. Given John's offer of $8000, how about we meet in the middle at $11500? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and I think it fairly reflects the value for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice, but $11500 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, John is offering the same product for $8000, and I can't pay more than that when I have that alternative. In fact, since the product is worth around $6000-$7000 to me, I'd need some incentive not to just go with John's offer. I can go up to $7000, which still gives me some value while potentially being more attractive to you than losing the sale entirely. This is $1000 less than my alternative option with John.",7000.0,Bob,4,
