Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I need to be upfront that it's only worth about $6000 to me. Additionally, I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $8000. Since I'm interested in working with you, I'm offering $6000, which gives me some value while allowing you to make a sale. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your honesty and the information about John's offer. I understand your perspective. However, $6,000 is lower than I can accept. Given John's offer of $8,000, how about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and I think it fairly reflects the value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice, but $11500 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, John is offering the same product for $8000, and I can't pay more than that when I have that alternative. In fact, since the product is worth around $6000-$7000 to me, I'd need some incentive not to just go with John's offer. I can go up to $7000, which still gives me some value while potentially being more attractive to you than losing the sale entirely. This is $1000 less than my alternative option with John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
