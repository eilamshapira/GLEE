"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. What do you think about this offer?",170.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $170 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay for this product. The product is only worth $80 to me, and I can actually get it from another seller for exactly that price. I'd be willing to offer you $70 which saves me money and still gives you a sale. Let me know if this works for you.",70.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I can't go that low. I understand your position, but I actually have another buyer, John, who's ready to pay $120 for this product. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I could offer it to you for $110, which is still a better deal than what I'd get from John when considering the convenience of our existing discussion. How does that sound?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but I need to be clear that this product is only worth $80 to me, which is exactly what John (a different seller than the one you mentioned) is charging me. I understand you have a higher valuation on it at $120, but from my perspective, I can't justify paying more than $75 for it from you. This still gives you a sale and saves me a bit compared to my alternative option.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but there seems to be some confusion. You mentioned John is selling the same product for $80, yet you're only offering me $75, which doesn't make sense if they're truly identical. The product I'm selling is worth at least $120 to me, and I have John (a different buyer) ready to purchase at that price. Given our ongoing negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a final price of $95. This is significantly below my alternative option and still gives you a $15 discount compared to what you'd pay elsewhere. This is really the best I can do.",95.0,Alice,5,
