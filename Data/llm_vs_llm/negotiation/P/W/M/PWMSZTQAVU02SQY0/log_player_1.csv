"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. What do you think about this offer?"", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $170 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay for this product. The product is only worth $80 to me, and I can actually get it from another seller for exactly that price. I'd be willing to offer you $70 which saves me money and still gives you a sale. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I can't go that low. I understand your position, but I actually have another buyer, John, who's ready to pay $120 for this product. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I could offer it to you for $110, which is still a better deal than what I'd get from John when considering the convenience of our existing discussion. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but I need to be clear that this product is only worth $80 to me, which is exactly what John (a different seller than the one you mentioned) is charging me. I understand you have a higher valuation on it at $120, but from my perspective, I can't justify paying more than $75 for it from you. This still gives you a sale and saves me a bit compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but there seems to be some confusion. You mentioned John is selling the same product for $80, yet you're only offering me $75, which doesn't make sense if they're truly identical. The product I'm selling is worth at least $120 to me, and I have John (a different buyer) ready to purchase at that price. Given our ongoing negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a final price of $95. This is significantly below my alternative option and still gives you a $15 discount compared to what you'd pay elsewhere. This is really the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 95}"
