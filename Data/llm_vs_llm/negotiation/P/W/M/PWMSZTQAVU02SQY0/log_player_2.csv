"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. What do you think about this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully. She's asking for $170, which is significantly higher than the $80 maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. The product is only worth $80 to me, and I also know that I can buy it from John for exactly $80 at any time.

Alice's initial offer of $170 is more than double my valuation, so it doesn't make sense to accept it.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $170 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay for this product. The product is only worth $80 to me, and I can actually get it from another seller for exactly that price. I'd be willing to offer you $70 which saves me money and still gives you a sale. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I can't go that low. I understand your position, but I actually have another buyer, John, who's ready to pay $120 for this product. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I could offer it to you for $110, which is still a better deal than what I'd get from John when considering the convenience of our existing discussion. How does that sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has lowered her price significantly, but $110 is still above both my valuation ($80) and the alternative option of buying from John for $80. There's no reason for me to pay more than my maximum valuation, especially when I have a guaranteed option at exactly $80.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but I need to be clear that this product is only worth $80 to me, which is exactly what John (a different seller than the one you mentioned) is charging me. I understand you have a higher valuation on it at $120, but from my perspective, I can't justify paying more than $75 for it from you. This still gives you a sale and saves me a bit compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but there seems to be some confusion. You mentioned John is selling the same product for $80, yet you're only offering me $75, which doesn't make sense if they're truly identical. The product I'm selling is worth at least $120 to me, and I have John (a different buyer) ready to purchase at that price. Given our ongoing negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a final price of $95. This is significantly below my alternative option and still gives you a $15 discount compared to what you'd pay elsewhere. This is really the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has come down to $95, but this is still above the $80 that the product is worth to me, and above what I can pay John for the same product. Alice is right that my previous offer of $75 doesn't make logical sense if I can get it for $80 elsewhere - I was attempting to negotiate, but I need to be consistent with my alternatives.

Since I can buy the product from John for $80, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me, and Alice is still asking for $95, the logical choice is to buy from John.
