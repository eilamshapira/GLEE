"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $100 for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $100 is too low for this product given its quality and value. I can offer it to you for $200, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. Would this work better for you?",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down to $200, Alice. However, that's still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $110? I think that's a fair price considering my budget constraints.",110.0,Bob,4,
