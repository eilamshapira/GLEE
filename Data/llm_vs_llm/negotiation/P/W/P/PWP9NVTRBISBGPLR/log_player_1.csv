"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{
    ""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $250. This is a fair price for such a premium item. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $100 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I believe we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.

{
    ""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $100 is too low for this product given its quality and value. I can offer it to you for $200, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. Would this work better for you?"",
    ""product_price"": 200
}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{
    ""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $100 is too low for this product given its quality and value. I can offer it to you for $200, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. Would this work better for you?"",
    ""product_price"": 200
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down to $200, Alice. However, that's still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $110? I think that's a fair price considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $150. Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and he's only increased his offer by $10 from his initial bid. Given that we're already in round 4 and the gap between our prices is still quite large, it seems unlikely that we'll reach a mutually acceptable price above $150. It's more profitable to take John's guaranteed offer of $150 now."
