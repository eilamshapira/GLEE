"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2400000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential return on investment.",2400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer, but $2400000 is far above what this product is worth to me. I'm looking for something that provides good value, and I can actually get this product from another seller for $1000000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a fair price. I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product, which would save me money while still providing you with a good sale. Let me know if this works for you.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I must respectfully disagree with your assessment of the product's value. While you mention another seller offering it at $1000000, I can assure you of the product's superior quality and market value. I understand you're looking for a good deal, so I'm willing to reduce my initial price significantly. I can offer it to you for $1900000, which is a fair price considering its true value. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with this more reasonable offer.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for reducing your price, but $1900000 is still significantly above what makes economic sense for me. As I mentioned, I can purchase this product elsewhere for $1000000, which is actually the maximum value it holds for me. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. To make this worth both our time, I'm willing to offer $850000 - which saves me money compared to my alternative while giving you a sale. If the product truly has additional value as you suggest, I hope you can meet me closer to my price point, as I simply cannot justify paying above what the product is worth to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,
