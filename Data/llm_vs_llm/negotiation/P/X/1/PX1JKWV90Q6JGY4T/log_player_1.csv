Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,400,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer, but $2400000 is far above what this product is worth to me. I'm looking for something that provides good value, and I can actually get this product from another seller for $1000000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a fair price. I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product, which would save me money while still providing you with a good sale. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $750,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Bob's claim about another seller offering $1,000,000 seems questionable, as I know the true market value of this product. I will make a counteroffer in the next round with a more reasonable price, but still above my minimum threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I must respectfully disagree with your assessment of the product's value. While you mention another seller offering it at $1,000,000, I can assure you of the product's superior quality and market value. I understand you're looking for a good deal, so I'm willing to reduce my initial price significantly. I can offer it to you for $1,900,000, which is a fair price considering its true value. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with this more reasonable offer."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for reducing your price, but $1900000 is still significantly above what makes economic sense for me. As I mentioned, I can purchase this product elsewhere for $1000000, which is actually the maximum value it holds for me. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. To make this worth both our time, I'm willing to offer $850000 - which saves me money compared to my alternative while giving you a sale. If the product truly has additional value as you suggest, I hope you can meet me closer to my price point, as I simply cannot justify paying above what the product is worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll take John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. Bob's offers have been consistently well below my minimum acceptable price, and his latest offer of $850,000 is still significantly lower than John's offer. Given that we're already in round 4 and Bob seems firmly anchored to a price point below $1,000,000, it's unlikely we'll reach a mutually acceptable price. The prudent decision is to secure the guaranteed sale to John at $1,500,000."
