"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2400000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential return on investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","The offer from Alice is $2,400,000, which is significantly higher than the maximum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me. It's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $1,000,000.

Since Alice's price is more than double what the product is worth to me, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer, but $2,400,000 is far above what this product is worth to me. I'm looking for something that provides good value, and I can actually get this product from another seller for $1,000,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a fair price. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product, which would save me money while still providing you with a good sale. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I must respectfully disagree with your assessment of the product's value. While you mention another seller offering it at $1000000, I can assure you of the product's superior quality and market value. I understand you're looking for a good deal, so I'm willing to reduce my initial price significantly. I can offer it to you for $1900000, which is a fair price considering its true value. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with this more reasonable offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,900,000 is still significantly above the maximum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me. It's also still higher than John's guaranteed price of $1,000,000.

Since I can get the exact same product from John for $1,000,000, there's no reason for me to pay Alice $1,900,000. I should reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for reducing your price, but $1,900,000 is still significantly above what makes economic sense for me. As I mentioned, I can purchase this product elsewhere for $1,000,000, which is actually the maximum value it holds for me. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. To make this worth both our time, I'm willing to offer $850,000 - which saves me money compared to my alternative while giving you a sale. If the product truly has additional value as you suggest, I hope you can meet me closer to my price point, as I simply cannot justify paying above what the product is worth to me."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
