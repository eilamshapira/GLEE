"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is well above the market value for this product. I know the product's value, and I can actually get it from another seller for $10000. However, I'd like to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $9500, which would give us both a fair deal.",9500.0,Bob,2,
