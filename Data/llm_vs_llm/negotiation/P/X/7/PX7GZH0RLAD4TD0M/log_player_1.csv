Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's characteristics and potential value."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is well above the market value for this product. I know the product's value, and I can actually get it from another seller for $10000. However, I'd like to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $9500, which would give us both a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
