"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's characteristics and potential value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000), it would not be rational to accept this offer. I have two reasonable options:

1. Buy from John immediately for $10,000
2. Reject and make a counteroffer to Alice

Since Alice mentioned the product is worth $10,000 to her, there might be room for negotiation to get a better price than John's. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial $15,000 but still potentially profitable for her, given that the product is worth $10,000 to her.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is well above the market value for this product. I know the product's value, and I can actually get it from another seller for $10,000. However, I'd like to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $9,500, which would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
