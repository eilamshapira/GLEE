"Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you today. I think you'll find it incredibly valuable. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is far too high for me. The product is only worth about $100 to me, and I can actually get it from another seller for $120. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it from you, which would save me some money and still give you a sale.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $90 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for lowering your price, Alice, but $140 is still more than I can get it elsewhere. As I mentioned, I can purchase this product from another seller for $120. If you can beat that price and offer it to me for $110, I'd be happy to buy from you instead.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  You're right that $140 is above your budget, but going as low as $110 doesn't leave me much room.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I still need to be practical about this purchase. As I mentioned, I can get this product from John for $120, so there's no incentive for me to pay more than that. If you can offer me the product for $115, that would give me a reason to buy from you instead.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting very close. I understand you can get this elsewhere for $120.  I'm willing to accept a small loss to close this deal today.  My final offer is $120. ",120.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for matching John's price of $120. I appreciate that you're willing to work with me on this. Since we've been negotiating in good faith, and to give me a reason to buy from you rather than John, would you consider going just a little lower to $115? That would make my decision very easy.",115.0,Bob,8,
