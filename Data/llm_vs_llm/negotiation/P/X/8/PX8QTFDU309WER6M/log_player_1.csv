"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is far too high for me. The product is only worth about $100 to me, and I can actually get it from another seller for $120. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it from you, which would save me some money and still give you a sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $90 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for lowering your price, Alice, but $140 is still more than I can get it elsewhere. As I mentioned, I can purchase this product from another seller for $120. If you can beat that price and offer it to me for $110, I'd be happy to buy from you instead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  You're right that $140 is above your budget, but going as low as $110 doesn't leave me much room.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I still need to be practical about this purchase. As I mentioned, I can get this product from John for $120, so there's no incentive for me to pay more than that. If you can offer me the product for $115, that would give me a reason to buy from you instead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting very close. I understand you can get this elsewhere for $120.  I'm willing to accept a small loss to close this deal today.  My final offer is $120. "", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for matching John's price of $120. I appreciate that you're willing to work with me on this. Since we've been negotiating in good faith, and to give me a reason to buy from you rather than John, would you consider going just a little lower to $115? That would make my decision very easy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's clear that Bob is intent on getting the product for $115 and is unlikely to budge.  At this point, it's not worth my time to haggle further when I have a guaranteed sale for $150 with John."
