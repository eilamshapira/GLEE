"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $10,000 is already below my maximum budget of $15,000, and it's a relatively good price, I'll consider my options carefully.

Given that this is the first round and I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, I might be able to get an even better deal. However, the risk of waiting is that Alice might not lower her price significantly, or she might even increase it if she feels I'm interested.

For now, I'll choose to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $10,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's lower, but still reasonable. I'll aim for a price that's around 20% lower than Alice's initial offer.

My counteroffer is: {""product_price"": $8,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice rejected my counteroffer of $8,000 and came back with a new offer of $9,500. This is still below my maximum budget of $15,000, but it's higher than my initial counteroffer.

Considering that Alice has already moved down from $10,000 to $9,500, I'm starting to get a sense that she might be willing to negotiate further, but she's not willing to go as low as $8,000.

I'll think about my next move carefully. Since I still have 7 rounds left to negotiate, I might try to make another counteroffer to see if I can get an even better price. However, I don't want to risk losing the deal or pushing Alice too far.

For now, I'll choose to reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer. I'll try to meet Alice halfway between my previous offer and her new offer.

My decision is to reject the offer, and I'll send a new counteroffer in the next round. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's latest offer was $9,500, and my previous counteroffer was $8,000, I'll try to meet her halfway. A price between $8,000 and $9,500 would be around $8,750.

My counteroffer is: {""product_price"": $8,750}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice rejected my counteroffer of $8,750 and came back with a new offer of $9,100. This is a smaller decrease than her previous concession, but it's still a move in the right direction.

At this point, I've negotiated with Alice for 4 rounds, and we've narrowed the price gap significantly. My initial target was to get the product for around $8,000, but Alice's latest offer of $9,100 is still a reasonable price.

Considering that I have 5 rounds left to negotiate, I could try to make another counteroffer to see if I can get an even better price. However, I'm starting to feel that Alice might not be willing to go much lower than $9,100.

Given the current price of $9,100, I'm getting close to my target price range. I'll think carefully about my next move.

For now, I'll choose to reject Alice's offer again, but I'll make a smaller concession in my next counteroffer to see if I can get her to meet me at a price that's closer to my target.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's latest offer was $9,100, and I'm trying to get closer to my target price range, I'll make a smaller concession in my next counteroffer. I'll aim for a price that's slightly higher than my previous offer of $8,750, but still lower than Alice's latest offer.

My counteroffer is: {""product_price"": $8,900}"
