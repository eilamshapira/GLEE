"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of 10000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer of $10000, but I cannot go that low. The product has exceptional quality and features that justify a higher price point. However, I'm willing to come down to $11500. This is still below the market value for a product of this caliber, so I believe it's a fair compromise. Would this work for you?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you, Alice, for your revised offer of 11500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still very interested in the product, but I was hoping we could meet somewhere in between your offer and my previous counteroffer. Would you be open to selling the product for 10750? I believe this price reflects a fair value for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
