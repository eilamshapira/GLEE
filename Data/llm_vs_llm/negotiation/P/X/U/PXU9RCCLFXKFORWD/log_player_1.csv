Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Given Bob's counteroffer of $110, I will reject it and try for a better price.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","This is a crucial decision. Bob is now offering $120, which is the same amount John is offering. Since I value the product at no less than $120, I am indifferent between selling to Bob or John at this point. However, I have the potential to earn more money with Bob.

I'll take the risk and try to get a slightly better price from Bob.
