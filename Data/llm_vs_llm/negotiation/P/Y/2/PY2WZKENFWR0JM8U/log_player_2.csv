"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a competitive price. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $119 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  You're better off rejecting this offer and going with your guaranteed lower price."
