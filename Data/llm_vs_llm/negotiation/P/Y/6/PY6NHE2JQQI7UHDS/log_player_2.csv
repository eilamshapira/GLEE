"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be beneficial for you. Given the quality and value of this product, I'm offering it to you at a price of $8000. This is a fair market price for this item, and I'm confident it will meet your needs. Would you like to proceed with this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since the product is worth $8,000 to me and Alice is offering it for the same price, I don't see any room for negotiation. Additionally, buying from John would also cost me $8,000, which is the same as Alice's offer. In this case, it doesn't matter who I buy from, as the price is the same.
