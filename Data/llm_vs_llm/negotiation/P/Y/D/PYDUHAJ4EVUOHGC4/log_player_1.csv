"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,500,000) and also lower than what the product is worth to him ($800,000), I will reject his offer and proceed to make a counteroffer that is closer to my target price but still leaves room for negotiation.

My counteroffer for Round 3 will be $1,400,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $700,000 is still below the value I have for the product and what it's worth to him. Since we are only in Round 4 and I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, I will reject his offer and try to meet him halfway between my last offer and his current offer, aiming to increase the price gradually.

My counteroffer for Round 5 will be $1,250,000, which is a compromise but still reflects the high value of the product.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $750,000 is getting closer to what the product is worth to him ($800,000), but it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). Considering we are halfway through the negotiation rounds, I'll try to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to both parties while keeping in mind the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory price.

My next step will be to make a counteroffer that slightly reduces the price from my previous offer but remains firm on the high value of the product.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $775,000 is still below the value the product holds for him and significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. With only a few rounds left, I need to weigh the potential of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob against the guaranteed sale price of $1,500,000 from John.

Given that Bob's offers have been incrementally increasing but are still far from my target, and considering the time constraint of the negotiation, I will make a decision that prioritizes the value of the product.
