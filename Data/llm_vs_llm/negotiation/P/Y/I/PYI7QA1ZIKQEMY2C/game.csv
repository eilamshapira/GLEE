"Hi Bob, I have a product I'd like to offer you. I believe it's a high-quality item with substantial value. I'm offering it to you for $15000. Let me know if you're interested.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $10000 is the absolute minimum I could accept as that's what another buyer (John) is already willing to pay. Given the quality and value of this product, I can come down to $13500. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer while reflecting the true value of the item. Would this work for you?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $13500 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. Given that John is willing to sell it for $12000, I'd like to counter with $11000. This is a fair price considering the market and my budget constraints. Let me know if you can accept this offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,
