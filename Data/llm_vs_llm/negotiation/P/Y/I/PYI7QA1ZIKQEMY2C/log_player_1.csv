While I understand budget constraints, $10,000 is the absolute minimum I could accept as that's what another buyer (John) is already willing to pay.

Bob's offer:

Given that John is willing to sell it for $12000, I'd like to counter with $11000. This is a fair price considering the market and my budget constraints. Let me know if you can accept this offer.
