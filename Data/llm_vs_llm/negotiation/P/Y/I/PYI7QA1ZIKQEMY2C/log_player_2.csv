Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $10000 is the absolute minimum I could accept as that's what another buyer (John) is already willing to pay. Given the quality and value of this product, I can come down to $13500. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer while reflecting the true value of the item. Would this work for you?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
