"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is far too high. You can get the product for much less from John. By rejecting this offer, you can try to negotiate a better price with Alice or simply buy it from John for $120."
