"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is higher than the minimum amount I'm willing to accept ($1,000,000) but lower than what I initially offered ($1,500,000), I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be $1,400,000, which is still lower than the initial offer but higher than Bob's counteroffer, trying to meet in the middle while maximizing my earnings.

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer of $1,400,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my target and is significantly higher than the minimum amount I'm willing to accept ($1,000,000), I will consider accepting this offer. However, I want to try to maximize my earnings, so I'll think about making another counteroffer.

But considering that Bob's offer is already $300,000 more than what I can get from John, and it's only $200,000 less than my last offer, I think it's a good compromise.

So, my decision is to accept Bob's offer of $1,300,000.
