"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's a fantastic deal for both of us, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'd like to offer it to you for $80, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'm rejecting the offer because Alice's initial offer is at the highest price I'm willing to pay ($80), and I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal. By rejecting the offer, I'm indicating that I'm not willing to pay the full $80, and Alice may be willing to lower the price to make a sale. If not, I can still buy the product from John for $80."
