"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. While it looks interesting, $25000 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $5000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand your concern about the price. However, $5000 is far too low. The product's unique features and benefits justify a higher price point. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower the price to $22500.",22500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $22500 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $7500?  That feels like a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offers, but $7500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go that low. Let's try another increment. I can offer it to you for $20000.",20000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're still pretty far apart.  I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's my absolute limit.",10000.0,Bob,6,
