"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $10800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle of our previous offers. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10200. If this is something you'd be willing to consider, I think we can finalize the sale.",10200.0,Bob,6,
