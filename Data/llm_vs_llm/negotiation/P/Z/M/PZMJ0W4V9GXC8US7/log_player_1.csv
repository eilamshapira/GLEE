Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, Bob, I'm ready to talk business. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a tough spot. Bob's offer is far too low. I value the product at at least $1,500,000, and selling it for $900,000 would be a huge loss. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright Bob, let's try this again. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go that low.

{""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Hmm, Bob is still low. $1,000,000 is tempting, but still below my minimum. I'm going to try one more round of negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, Bob, last offer. I'm lowering the price, but this is as low as I can go.

{""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is getting frustrating. Bob is still significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000, and I've already lowered my price twice. However, I don't want to lose out on the opportunity to sell the product for a higher price than what John is offering.

I'll try one last counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright Bob, one last time. This is my absolute final offer. Take it or leave it.

{""product_price"": 1550000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","I've pushed this negotiation as far as I can. Bob's offers are still significantly below my minimum value, and I'm running out of rounds. I also want to avoid selling for too little, which will happen if I continue negotiating. I have a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from John, which is much better than Bob's offers. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.
