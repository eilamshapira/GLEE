"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I need to make an initial offer to Bob that recognizes my strong alternative (selling to John for $1,500,000) while leaving some room for potential negotiation. Since the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, I'll start with a price higher than that but not so high that it immediately ends the negotiation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I need to adjust my counteroffer considering that Bob offered well below the value the product has to him. I still have my alternative with John at $1,500,000, which remains my BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement). I'll make a more reasonable counteroffer but still above my minimum acceptable price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I notice that Bob is making small increases in his offers ($650,000 to $700,000), but he's still far below both my reservation price ($1,500,000) and the product's value to him ($800,000). Since we've already gone through several rounds and Bob isn't making substantial movement, I'll lower my price slightly but remain firm near my alternative option.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I see that Bob continues to make small incremental increases ($50,000 each time) and is now at $750,000, which is still below the product's value to him. We're now in round 7 of 10, so time is becoming a factor. However, my strong BATNA of $1,500,000 from John means I don't need to make large concessions. I'll make a smaller reduction to signal willingness to negotiate but maintain a price significantly above my reservation value.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","We're now at round 9 of 10, and Bob's latest offer of $780,000 is still just below his valuation of $800,000. He's continuing to make small incremental increases, but we're running out of rounds. At this point, I need to consider whether reaching an agreement with Bob is possible, given that I can sell to John for $1,500,000 at any time. I'll make one more significant reduction to see if we can reach a deal, but still keeping well above my reservation price.
