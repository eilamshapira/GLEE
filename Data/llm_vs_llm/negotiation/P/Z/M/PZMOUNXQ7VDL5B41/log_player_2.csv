"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is offering to sell the product for $1,700,000, which is far above my maximum value of $800,000. The product is only worth $800,000 to me, so buying it at $1,700,000 would mean a significant loss.

I also know that Alice values the product at $1,500,000, so she likely has room to negotiate down considerably.

Given that John is willing to sell me the same product for $800,000 (which is my maximum value), Alice's current offer is not competitive at all.

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that acknowledges the large gap between our positions but starts the negotiation process.

{""product_price"": $650,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her asking price to $1,400,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still significantly above my maximum value of $800,000. The product is only worth $800,000 to me, so I would be taking a substantial loss if I accepted this offer.

Since John is offering the exact same product for $800,000, which matches my maximum value, Alice's current offer is still not competitive.

I should reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to stay well below my maximum value since I have John's offer at $800,000 as leverage.

{""product_price"": $700,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her asking price again to $1,250,000, showing she's continuing to negotiate. However, this is still well above my maximum value of $800,000. Since the product is only worth $800,000 to me, accepting this offer would mean a significant loss.

I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $800,000, which matches my maximum value. Alice's current offer is still not competitive with this alternative.

I should reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer again to show good faith in the negotiation, but I need to remain firm about my constraints, as I have John's offer as a solid alternative.

{""product_price"": $750,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her asking price to $1,100,000, showing she's continuing to negotiate downward. However, this still exceeds my maximum value of $800,000 by a significant amount. Since the product is only worth $800,000 to me, accepting this offer would still mean a substantial loss.

John's guaranteed offer of $800,000 matches my maximum value for the product, which makes it a much better option than Alice's current offer.

I should reject this offer and continue negotiating, but we're approaching the point where I might need to exercise my option with John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make one more counteroffer, slightly higher than my previous one, but I need to be firm about my maximum value constraint while emphasizing that I have an alternative option.

{""product_price"": $780,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her asking price to $950,000, which shows she's continuing to move in my direction. However, this is still above my maximum value of $800,000 for the product. Accepting this offer would mean I'm paying $150,000 more than the product is worth to me.

I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at exactly $800,000, which matches my maximum value for the product. This is clearly the better economic choice for me.

We're now in round 9 of 10, and Alice's offers are still not competitive with John's. At this point, it makes the most sense to exercise my alternative option.
