"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $120. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $80 to me
2. John is offering the same product for $80
3. Alice's offer of $120 is significantly above both my maximum value and John's price

The rational decision is to reject Alice's offer since $120 is well above both my maximum valuation ($80) and John's alternative price ($80).

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that reflects my valuation while leaving room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $120 is quite high for me. I know the market value of this product, and I can get it elsewhere for $80. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation. I can offer you $70 for the product."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $70 is too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $95. This way, we both get a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer of $95 is still higher than:
1. My maximum valuation ($80)
2. John's available price ($80)

There's no reason to accept this offer. While Alice has moved down from $120 to $95, it's still not competitive with my alternative option from John.
