"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be very valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,500,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, my budget is a bit tighter than that. I am interested in the product, but I can only offer $1400000 at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 (which is what John is willing to pay), so I cannot accept it. However, since Bob has shown interest and we're only in round 2, there's room for negotiation to reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, I must inform you that I have another buyer willing to pay $1,500,000. However, I'm interested in working with you and can offer the product for $1,900,000, which is significantly lower than my initial price. This price better reflects the product's true value while still giving you excellent potential for returns."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
