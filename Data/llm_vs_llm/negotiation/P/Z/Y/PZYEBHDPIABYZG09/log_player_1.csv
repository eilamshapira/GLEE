Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible.  Offering it slightly below my guaranteed price with John creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  While Bob values it at $800,000,  offering it at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation and suggests a higher inherent value.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing I have John as a backup at my desired price gives me leverage. I don't need to desperately lowball the price."
