Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I've been researching this product extensively and know that I can purchase it elsewhere for $1000000, which is actually the maximum I'm willing to pay for it. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Would you consider $850000 for the product? This would save me some money compared to my alternative option and still provide you with a sale today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
