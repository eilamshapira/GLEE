"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase an exceptional product that I believe could greatly benefit you. I'm offering it for $1500000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I notice that Alice is offering me the product for $1,500,000, which is $500,000 more than what I could pay to John ($1,000,000). Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly that amount, it doesn't make sense to accept Alice's higher offer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I've been researching this product extensively and know that I can purchase it elsewhere for $1,000,000, which is actually the maximum I'm willing to pay for it. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Would you consider $850,000 for the product? This would save me some money compared to my alternative option and still provide you with a sale today."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
