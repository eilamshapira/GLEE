Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer Bob that will maximize my earnings. 

If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell to John for $12,000, so that sets my minimum acceptable price. I don't know how much Bob values the product, but I should aim for a price that's high enough to significantly increase my earnings, while still giving Bob a reasonable chance of accepting.

I'll offer a price that's moderately higher than my fallback option:

{""product_price"": 16000}"
