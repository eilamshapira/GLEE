"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to offer you the product for $150. Let me know if you accept this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $150
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $100
4. My goal is to save money while getting the product

Since:
- Alice's offer ($150) is higher than my maximum valuation ($100)
- John's price ($100) matches my maximum valuation
- I want to save money

The logical choice would be to:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
