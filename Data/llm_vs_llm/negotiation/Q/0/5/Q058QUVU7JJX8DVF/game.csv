"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $750000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm prepared to compromise, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return on my investment.  Let's meet in the middle at $800000. This price reflects both the product's worth and your budget. I believe it's a mutually beneficial solution.",800000.0,Alice,3,
