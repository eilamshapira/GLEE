"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $5000. What do you think?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $20000. Let me know if this works for you.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $20000 is still beyond what I'm willing to pay. I can do $7000, and I think that's a very fair offer. Let me know if we can make this work.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're interested but we're still far apart on the price. I can go as low as $18000, which is a significant reduction from my original offer. Let me know if this could work for you.",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement, but honestly, $18000 is still more than I had in mind. I need to stick around my previous offer of $7000. However, to show I'm serious, I can increase it slightly to $7500. I need to know if we have a deal soon though, as I have another option I need to consider.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, and I'm trying to find a middle ground. I can lower the price to $16000, which is the lowest I can go while still valuing the product appropriately. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",16000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for trying. I appreciate that you're trying to find a compromise. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $8000.  If you're willing to come down to that price, I'll buy it from you right now. Otherwise, I'll have to go with the other offer.",8000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you have another offer, but I believe this product is worth more. I can meet you halfway at $15500, which is just above my minimum threshold. This is my final offer before I consider other options. Let me know if you can accept this.",15500.0,Alice,9,
