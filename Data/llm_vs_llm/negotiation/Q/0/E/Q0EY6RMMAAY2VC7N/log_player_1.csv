Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,500,000), I will reject his offer. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a better option than accepting Bob's offer, but I will try to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a higher price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I will make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. This will give Bob an opportunity to reconsider and potentially meet me at a higher price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $750,000 is still lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,500,000). While it's an improvement from his previous offer, it's not enough to convince me to sell.

At this point, I think it's more beneficial to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, as it meets my minimum value requirement. Continuing to negotiate with Bob may not yield a better result, and I risk losing the opportunity to sell to John.
