"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The offer from Alice at $1,700,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000, and it's also higher than Alice's own valuation of $1,500,000. Since John is offering the product at $800,000, which is exactly my maximum value, it makes the most sense to buy from John rather than continue negotiating with Alice, who started with such a high initial offer."
