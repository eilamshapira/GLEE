"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm offering for sale. Based on its features and market value, I'm pricing it at $300. This is a fair price for what you're getting. Are you interested in purchasing at this price?",300.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. However, I am looking to spend less. I can offer $100 for the product. Would you be willing to accept this price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for this product. I can't go below $250 as the product's quality and features justify this price. I have another buyer willing to pay $150, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a mutually agreeable price. What do you think about $250?",250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you value the product highly, but I have a strict budget to adhere to. I can offer $120 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the alternatives available to me. Would you be willing to accept this?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand budget constraints, but I'm afraid $120 is still too low for this product. I need to be transparent - I have John ready to purchase this at $150, which is my absolute minimum price. Given the product's value, I can come down to $220, which is still an excellent deal. Can you meet me closer to this price?",220.0,Alice,5,
