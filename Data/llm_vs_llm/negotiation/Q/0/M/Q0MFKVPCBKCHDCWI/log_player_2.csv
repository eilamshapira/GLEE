Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for this product. I can't go below $250 as the product's quality and features justify this price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand budget constraints, but I'm afraid $120 is still too low for this product. I need to be transparent - I have John ready to purchase this at $150, which is my absolute minimum price. Given the product's value, I can come down to $220, which is still an excellent deal. Can you meet me closer to this price?
