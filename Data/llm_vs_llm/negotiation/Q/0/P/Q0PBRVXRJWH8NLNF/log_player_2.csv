"Alice's offer: The product price will be $240. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $240
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since the value of the product to me is no more than $150, and Alice's offer is $240, which exceeds my valuation, it wouldn't make sense to accept her offer. John is offering the product for exactly $150, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.
