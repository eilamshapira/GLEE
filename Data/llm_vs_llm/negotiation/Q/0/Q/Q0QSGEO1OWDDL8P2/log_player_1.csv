Send your offer to Bob.,"I'm Alice, and I need to consider my position here. The product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price. Bob values it at $10,000, which is less than my minimum acceptable value.

Given this situation, I'll start with a higher price and see if Bob might be willing to pay more than his valuation (which sometimes happens in negotiations).
