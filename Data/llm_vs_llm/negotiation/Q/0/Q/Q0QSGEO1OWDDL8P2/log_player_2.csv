Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer. It's definitely worth trying to negotiate a better price."

This is a starting offer to gauge Alice's bottom line. It's a lowball offer, but it leaves plenty of room for negotiation upwards while staying well below John's price."

While Alice came down slightly, the price is still too high. We're getting closer to my limit, but there's still room to negotiate before considering John's offer."

This offer is a significant jump from the previous one, showing Alice I'm willing to move closer to her price range. However, it's still comfortably below my maximum and John's offer, leaving some room for further negotiation."

Alice seems stuck on $15,000 and unwilling to budge further. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer of $10,000."
