I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but I'm leaving some room to negotiate. I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is too low for me. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum.  Hopefully, Bob will find this more appealing, but I'm still prepared to walk away if he's unwilling to meet me halfway."
