"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since the offered price of $15,000 is above my maximum budget of $12,000, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price. Buying from John for $12,000 is an option, but I'd like to see if I can get an even better deal from Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since my maximum budget is $12,000, I'll offer a price that is somewhat lower to leave room for negotiation.
