"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer and compare it with John's option.

Alice is offering the product for $9,800, which is higher than the $8,000 that John is asking for the same product. Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, I shouldn't pay more than that amount.

The best financial decision is to buy from John for $8,000 rather than accept Alice's higher-priced offer of $9,800.
