"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000 and John's fixed price of $8,000, the logical choice is to buy from John. This will save me $7,000 compared to Alice's offer and still get me the product I need.
