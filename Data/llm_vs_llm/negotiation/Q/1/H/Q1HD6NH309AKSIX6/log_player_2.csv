"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given the information, I need to decide what's best for me as Bob.

Alice is offering the product for $2,500,000, which is significantly higher than the product's worth to me (no more than $1,200,000).

John is willing to sell the same product for $1,200,000, which is exactly at my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's offer exceeds what the product is worth to me, and John's offer is at my maximum acceptable price, the rational choice is to buy from John.
