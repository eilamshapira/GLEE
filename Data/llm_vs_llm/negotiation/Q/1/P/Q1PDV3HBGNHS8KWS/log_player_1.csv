Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Considering its exceptional quality and value, I'm asking for a price of $950,000."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I believe this price fairly reflects the product's value."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $870000. This price is closer to the middle point and still reflects the product's value. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $870,000
