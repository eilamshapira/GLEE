"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","The initial offer of $150 is higher than my maximum value of $120. I will also explore other option before giving in to Alice's offer. Buying from John immediately would be a safe but potentially more expensive choice if I could negotiate a lower price with Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I will start with a low offer, giving myself room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a good price.
