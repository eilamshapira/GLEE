"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer of $200 is above the maximum value the product is worth to me ($150), and John is willing to sell the same product for exactly $150, it wouldn't be rational for me to accept Alice's offer.

I have two options: make a counteroffer to Alice or buy from John. Since John's price is already at my maximum value, there's no real benefit in continuing negotiations with Alice unless I believe I can get it for less than $150.
