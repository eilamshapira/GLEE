Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. I know the product is worth at least $120 to me, and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $120. Since Bob's valuation is unknown, I should offer a price higher than $120 to potentially capture more value, but not so high that it's likely to be rejected.

A reasonable price would be $180, which gives Bob room to get value if their valuation is higher, while giving me a good premium over my minimum acceptable price of $120.
