"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $5,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($15,000), I will reject his offer.

Also, selling to John for $15,000 is still an option, but I want to try to get a better price from Bob.

So, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's still high, but slightly lower than my initial offer, to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle.

{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $5,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000, and also lower than my previous counteroffer of $18,000.

At this point, I'm not seeing a lot of movement from Bob towards my target price, so I'm starting to consider selling to John for $15,000 as a more viable option.

However, I'll give Bob one more chance to come up to a reasonable price. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer, but this time, I'll make it closer to my minimum value.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer of $17,000."
