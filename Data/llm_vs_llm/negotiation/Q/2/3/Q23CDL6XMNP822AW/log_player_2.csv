"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The offer of $20,000 is much higher than my maximum valuation of $8,000, and it's also higher than John's price of $8,000. It wouldn't make sense for me to accept this offer.

Since John is willing to sell the product for $8,000 (which is the maximum I value it at), I could buy from him. However, I should first try to negotiate with Alice to see if I can get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice that's significantly lower than her asking price but still reasonable as a starting point for negotiation.

{""product_price"": $5,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has only reduced her offer from $20,000 to $18,000, which is still significantly higher than both my maximum valuation of $8,000 and John's price of $8,000. This offer doesn't make financial sense for me to accept.

I'll continue negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has only made a small reduction from her initial offer. I need to communicate that her price is still far above what I'm willing to pay, but I'll increase my offer slightly to show good faith in the negotiation.

{""product_price"": $5,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice continues to offer prices far above both my maximum valuation of $8,000 and John's alternative price of $8,000. Her current offer of $17,000 is still more than double what I'm willing to pay.

Since Alice is only making small reductions in her price and we're already at round 5 (halfway through our negotiation rounds), it seems unlikely that we'll reach an agreement below $8,000.

Given that John is offering the product at exactly my maximum valuation, it makes sense to take that guaranteed option rather than continue with a negotiation that's showing little promise.
