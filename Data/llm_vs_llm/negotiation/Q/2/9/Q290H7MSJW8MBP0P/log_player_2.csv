"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer ($150) is higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100), there's no reason to accept it. While I could make a counteroffer, since John's price equals my maximum value and matches the seller's cost, it's actually a fair price. There's no guarantee Alice will go lower than $100 in negotiations.
