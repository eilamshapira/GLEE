"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600000. I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand budget considerations, but given the exceptional quality and value of this product, I must ask for a price of $1700000. I believe this offer strikes a fair balance between the product's worth and market considerations. Looking forward to your thoughts.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $1700000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $700000. I believe this price is more in line with my needs and budget, and I'm willing to make a deal if we can meet at this point.",700000.0,Bob,4,
