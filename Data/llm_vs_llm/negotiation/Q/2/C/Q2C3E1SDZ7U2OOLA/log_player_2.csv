"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $1,400,000
2. Buy from John: $1,500,000

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and:
- Alice's offer ($1,400,000) is $100,000 less than John's price ($1,500,000)
- The price is within my maximum limit of $1,500,000
- Even though Alice's profit is high ($200,000), I still save money compared to buying from John
