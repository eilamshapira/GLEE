"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $140. It's a great product and I think you'll find it very useful. Are you interested?",140.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $140 is quite high for me. The product is only worth about $80 to me, which happens to be the same price John is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $70 for the product. What do you think?",70.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, after considering your perspective, I'm willing to lower my offer to $125. This is a great value for the product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $125 is still significantly more than I can justify spending. Remember, this product is only worth $80 to me, and I can get it from John at that exact price. To continue our negotiation, I'm willing to offer $75. This gives you a better deal than selling to someone else at cost, while giving me a slight advantage over John's price.",75.0,Bob,4,
