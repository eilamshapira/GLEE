Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $140 is quite high for me. The product is only worth about $80 to me, which happens to be the same price John is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $70 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $125 is still significantly more than I can justify spending. Remember, this product is only worth $80 to me, and I can get it from John at that exact price. To continue our negotiation, I'm willing to offer $75. This gives you a better deal than selling to someone else at cost, while giving me a slight advantage over John's price.
