"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $140. It's a great product and I think you'll find it very useful. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $140, which is significantly above the $80 worth I place on it. This price is even higher than the alternative option of buying from John for $80.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $140 is quite high for me. The product is only worth about $80 to me, which happens to be the same price John is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $70 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after considering your perspective, I'm willing to lower my offer to $125. This is a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has lowered her price to $125, but this is still well above the $80 maximum I'm willing to pay, and it's higher than John's offer of $80. Since Alice didn't come close to a price that would work for me, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $125 is still significantly more than I can justify spending. Remember, this product is only worth $80 to me, and I can get it from John at that exact price. To continue our negotiation, I'm willing to offer $75. This gives you a better deal than selling to someone else at cost, while giving me a slight advantage over John's price."", ""product_price"": 75}"
