Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}

**Reasoning:** Starting with a strong counter-offer significantly below my maximum price gives us room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a good deal. Alice's initial offer being so high suggests she might have a lot of margin to work with."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

{""product_price"": 1100000}
