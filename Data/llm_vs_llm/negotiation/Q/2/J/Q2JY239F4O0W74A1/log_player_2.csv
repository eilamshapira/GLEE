"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my premium product to you for $25000. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $25,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $15,000

The logical choice is to buy from John. Even if I make a counteroffer to Alice, it's unlikely she'll drop the price below $15,000 given her initial high offer of $25,000. There's no reason to pay more than the product is worth to me, especially when I have a guaranteed option at my maximum value point.
