"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $12500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth.",12500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, I find $12500 to be quite high. Based on my market research and the product's features, I believe a more reasonable price would be $9000. This would be fair for both of us considering the current market conditions.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $9000 is too low considering the product's value. I can offer it to you for $11000, which represents a significant reduction from my initial price and is still a good value given the product's worth.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate the movement in the right direction. However, I'm still finding $11000 to be on the higher side. I can meet you in the middle at $10000, which I think is fair considering the market value. This would be a win-win for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
