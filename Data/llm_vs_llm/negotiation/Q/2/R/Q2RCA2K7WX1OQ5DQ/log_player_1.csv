Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, I find $12500 to be quite high. Based on my market research and the product's features, I believe a more reasonable price would be $9000. This would be fair for both of us considering the current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. $9,000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and I know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob. I should continue negotiating for a better price.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $9,000 is too low considering the product's value. I can offer it to you for $11,000, which represents a significant reduction from my initial price and is still a good value given the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 11000}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate the movement in the right direction. However, I'm still finding $11000 to be on the higher side. I can meet you in the middle at $10000, which I think is fair considering the market value. This would be a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $10,000. This is a reasonable compromise as it's significantly better than my minimum price of $8,000 (John's offer), and while Bob values the product at $15,000, pushing too hard might risk losing the deal altogether. $10,000 represents a fair middle ground that gives both parties value."
