"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $12500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's offer of $12,500 is significantly higher than what the product is worth to her ($8,000), but still less than what the product is worth to me ($15,000). I could potentially negotiate a better price by making a counteroffer rather than accepting immediately or going to John, whose price is higher.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, I find $12,500 to be quite high. Based on my market research and the product's features, I believe a more reasonable price would be $9,000. This would be fair for both of us considering the current market conditions."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $9000 is too low considering the product's value. I can offer it to you for $11000, which represents a significant reduction from my initial price and is still a good value given the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down considerably from her initial price of $12,500 to $11,000, which is a good sign. Since the product is worth $15,000 to me, this is already a good deal, but I might be able to negotiate an even better price. The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's still room for negotiation. John's price of $15,000 remains higher than Alice's current offer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate the movement in the right direction. However, I'm still finding $11,000 to be on the higher side. I can meet you in the middle at $10,000, which I think is fair considering the market value. This would be a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
