"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its market value and potential, I'm offering it at $1400000. This price reflects the product's quality and value proposition.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I believe the price is a bit high. After considering the market value and potential, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1250000. I think this price is more reasonable and reflects the product's value.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, given the product's market value and features, $1250000 is too low. I understand you're looking for a better price, so I'm willing to adjust my initial offer. I can offer the product for $1350000, which represents a significant reduction from my initial price while still reflecting the product's true value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous counteroffer and for your new offer. I appreciate the reduction in price, but I still believe we can find a better middle ground. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $1300000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiations so far.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
