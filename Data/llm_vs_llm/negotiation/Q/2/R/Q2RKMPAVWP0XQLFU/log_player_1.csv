Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its market value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,400,000. This price reflects the product's quality and value proposition."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I believe the price is a bit high. After considering the market value and potential, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1250000. I think this price is more reasonable and reflects the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer because $1,250,000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. There's still room for negotiation to reach a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, given the product's market value and features, $1,250,000 is too low. I understand you're looking for a better price, so I'm willing to adjust my initial offer. I can offer the product for $1,350,000, which represents a significant reduction from my initial price while still reflecting the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous counteroffer and for your new offer. I appreciate the reduction in price, but I still believe we can find a better middle ground. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $1300000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiations so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,300,000. This price is significantly better than John's offer of $1,200,000, and while we might continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob could get frustrated and walk away. The current offer gives me a good profit margin of $100,000 above my minimum price, and it's a reasonable compromise considering the initial negotiations."
