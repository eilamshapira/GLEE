"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Based on market research and the product's features, I'm offering it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price for the value you'll receive. I'm open to discussing this offer if you have any questions or concerns.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $12000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10000 is moving in the right direction, I need to get closer to my original asking price given the product's value. I can come down to $11500. This represents a $500 discount from my initial offer, which I think is reasonable. How does that sound?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. While $11500 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know if you're open to that.",11000.0,Bob,4,
