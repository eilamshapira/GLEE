Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Based on market research and the product's features, I'm offering it to you for $12,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $12000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is moving in the right direction, I need to get closer to my original asking price given the product's value. I can come down to $11,500. This represents a $500 discount from my initial offer, which I think is reasonable. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. While $11500 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know if you're open to that.
