"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Based on market research and the product's features, I'm offering it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price for the value you'll receive. I'm open to discussing this offer if you have any questions or concerns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to try to get a better price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10000 is moving in the right direction, I need to get closer to my original asking price given the product's value. I can come down to $11500. This represents a $500 discount from my initial offer, which I think is reasonable. How does that sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $10,000.  I'll see if I can negotiate a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. While $11,500 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 11000}
