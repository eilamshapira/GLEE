# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’d like to offer you our premium product for $200. Let me know if you’d like to proceed with this offer—if not, I have another buyer willing to take it for $150.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your budget and what you know you can get it for from John. By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of a lower counter-offer or can proceed with buying from John at a much lower price."
