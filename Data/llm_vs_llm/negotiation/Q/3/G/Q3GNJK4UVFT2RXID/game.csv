"Thanks for your offer, Alice, but I believe the price is too high for me. How about we settle on $9000 for the product?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer, but I can't accept $9000 as it's below my minimum threshold. I understand my initial offer may have been high for you, so I'm willing to come down to $16000. This product has significant value, and I already have another buyer willing to pay $15000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a fair agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciated your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still find $16000 to be above my budget. How about $9500? I believe this could be a fair starting point for our negotiations.",9500.0,Bob,4,
