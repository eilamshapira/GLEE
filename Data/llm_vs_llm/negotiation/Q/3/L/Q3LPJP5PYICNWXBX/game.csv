"Hi Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $25000. This is a competitive price for what you're getting. Would you like to proceed with the purchase?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and quality of similar products. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'd like to start with this offer.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest, but I must be transparent - I have another buyer willing to pay $15000, and the product's value is significantly higher than your current offer. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I can lower my initial asking price to $22000. This is still a competitive price given the product's quality and market value. Would this work for you?",22000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, the price of $22000 is still a bit steep for me. Considering the other buyer's offer of $15000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and that price. I'd like to propose a price of $12500. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
