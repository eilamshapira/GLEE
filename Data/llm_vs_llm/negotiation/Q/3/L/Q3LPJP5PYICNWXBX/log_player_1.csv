Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $25,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and quality of similar products. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'd like to start with this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Given that Bob's offer of $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 (which I can get from John), I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer. Bob's willingness to negotiate suggests there might be room to reach a better price than John's $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest, but I must be transparent - I have another buyer willing to pay $15,000, and the product's value is significantly higher than your current offer. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I can lower my initial asking price to $22,000. This is still a competitive price given the product's quality and market value. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, the price of $22000 is still a bit steep for me. Considering the other buyer's offer of $15000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and that price. I'd like to propose a price of $12500. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Given that Bob's new offer of $12,500 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $15,000, and Bob's increase from his initial offer was relatively small (only $2,500), it seems unlikely we'll reach a price above $15,000. The most prudent decision is to sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000 rather than continue negotiations that may not yield a better result."
