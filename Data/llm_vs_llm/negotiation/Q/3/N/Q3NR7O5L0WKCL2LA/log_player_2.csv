# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is more than the $800,000 it's worth to me. Since John is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $800,000, it makes financial sense to go with John's offer.
