"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $200 is more than I can spend. Given that I can find similar products elsewhere for $150, would you be willing to sell it for $120? This would make it a more attractive option for me.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $120 is lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Would you be interested in purchasing the product for $180?",180.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $150. For me to choose your product over theirs, I'd need a better price. Would you consider $130? This would make it worth my while to purchase from you instead.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your honesty about the other offer. I appreciate your interest in my product. Considering the competition, I'm willing to make a more competitive offer. I can sell it to you for $160. This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, given the product's value and the alternative offer from John.",160.0,Alice,5,
