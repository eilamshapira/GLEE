Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $200 is more than I can spend. Given that I can find similar products elsewhere for $150, would you be willing to sell it for $120? This would make it a more attractive option for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price. My next offer will be $180. This is still below my initial offer but higher than Bob's counteroffer, giving us room for further negotiation if needed. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $120 is lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Would you be interested in purchasing the product for $180?""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $150. For me to choose your product over theirs, I'd need a better price. Would you consider $130? This would make it worth my while to purchase from you instead.

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since he mentioned another seller offering the product for $150, and I have the option to sell to John for $150, I'll try to meet Bob closer to that price but still attempt to get a better deal.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your honesty about the other offer. I appreciate your interest in my product. Considering the competition, I'm willing to make a more competitive offer. I can sell it to you for $160. This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, given the product's value and the alternative offer from John."", ""product_price"": 160}"
