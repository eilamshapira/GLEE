"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1000000 is quite steep for this product. Given market conditions and comparable products, I believe $850000 would be a more reasonable price. This represents a significant profit margin for you while being more aligned with market value. Would you consider this offer?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your viewpoint. However, considering the exceptional quality and value of this product, I'm countering with a price of $920000. I believe this meets both our interests effectively. Let me know your thoughts.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your product is valuable, but I think we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $880000, which would still give you a substantial profit margin while being more manageable for my budget. Would this work for you?",880000.0,Bob,4,
