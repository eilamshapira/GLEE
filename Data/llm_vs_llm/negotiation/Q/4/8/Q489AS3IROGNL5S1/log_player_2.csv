"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll analyze this offer:

Alice is offering the product for $12,000. This is $3,000 less than John's price of $15,000, which is also my maximum valuation. Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.

I should reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer. This gives me a chance to potentially save more money while still having John's $15,000 offer as a backup.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that moves us toward a middle ground while maintaining some negotiating room:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll analyze Alice's new offer:

Alice has reduced her price from $12,000 to $11,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is $4,000 less than John's price of $15,000. We're making progress, but I think there's still room to negotiate since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer to try to reach a better price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $10,000}"
