``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $15,000. I'm hoping to get a good price, but also leaving room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,500 is closer to my minimum, but I'm willing to hold out for a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm coming down a bit from my original offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to the middle ground.  I'm hopeful that Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
