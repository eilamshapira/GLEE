"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of $12,000, make a counteroffer, or buy from John at $15,000.

Since the product is worth up to $15,000 to me, Alice's offer of $12,000 is below my maximum valuation, which is good. However, considering that the product only costs Alice $8,000, there's room for negotiation to get a better price.

Buying from John at $15,000 would be my worst option, as I'd be paying the maximum amount I value the product at, leaving me no consumer surplus.

I should reject Alice's first offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's $12,000 but still provides her with a reasonable profit above her $8,000 cost.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has lowered her offer from $12,000 to $10,500, which is a significant improvement. This is $4,500 less than my maximum value of $15,000 and only $2,500 above Alice's cost of $8,000.

While I could try another round of negotiation, Alice has already moved considerably from her initial offer. The $10,500 price gives me a good consumer surplus, and there's a risk that if I push too hard, negotiations might break down.

This price represents a reasonable compromise between us, so I'll accept it.
