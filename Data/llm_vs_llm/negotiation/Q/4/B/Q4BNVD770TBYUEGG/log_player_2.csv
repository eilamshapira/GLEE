"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,200,000 (which is also John's price). There's no reason to accept this offer when I can either negotiate for a better price or ultimately buy from John for $1,200,000. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 900000}

I'll start with a relatively low offer of $900,000. This gives room for negotiation while being a reasonable starting point. It's significantly below John's price of $1,200,000, which gives me leverage in the negotiation. If Alice counter-offers, we can potentially meet somewhere in the middle that's below John's price, which would be beneficial for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,400,000 is still significantly above John's price of $1,200,000. While she has reduced her initial offer by $100,000, it's still not competitive with John's price. There's no reason to accept this offer when I can either continue negotiating for a better price or buy from John for $1,200,000. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'll increase my previous offer to $1,000,000. This shows some movement from my side and demonstrates willingness to negotiate, while still leaving room for further negotiation. It's a significant increase from my previous offer of $900,000, which signals good faith, but remains well below John's price of $1,200,000. The goal is to reach a price that's below John's price, making the deal beneficial for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above John's price of $1,200,000. While Alice is gradually lowering her price (from $1,500,000 to $1,400,000 to $1,300,000), there's still no reason to accept an offer higher than my guaranteed alternative with John. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, but if Alice doesn't come below $1,200,000 soon, I may need to consider taking John's offer as we're halfway through our negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'll increase my offer to $1,100,000. This is another significant step up from my previous offer of $1,000,000, showing continued good faith in the negotiation. It's now quite close to John's price of $1,200,000, but still gives Alice room to make a profit if her costs are lower. We're getting into the later rounds of negotiation, so I'm hoping this substantial increase will encourage Alice to meet me at a price below John's offer."
