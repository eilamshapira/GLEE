"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and I have the option to sell to John for $100, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I will also not sell to John immediately, as I want to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.
