"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. Given its exceptional quality and value, I'm pricing it at $200. I believe it's a fair price considering what it can do for you. Let me know if you're interested!",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. While it looks great, $200 is a bit out of my price range. Would you be willing to consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $100 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $180. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested, but $180 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? That's a fair price that works for me.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $160. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive a hard bargain! I understand $160 is a significant price drop, but I'm hoping we can settle this with one final offer. Would you be willing to do $145? That's really the most I can justify spending.",145.0,Bob,6,
