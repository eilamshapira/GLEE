"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth at least $10,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at $10,000, I'll start with a high initial offer to test Bob's willingness to pay and leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer ($7,500) is below my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) and even below John's guaranteed offer ($10,000), I will reject this offer. There's no reason to accept less than what John is willing to pay.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will proceed to make a new counteroffer in the next round, but will lower my initial asking price to show some flexibility in negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price significantly from the initial $20,000 to show willingness to negotiate, but still keep it well above my minimum threshold of $10,000.

{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's new offer ($8,500) is still below my minimum acceptable price and John's guaranteed offer ($10,000). While Bob has increased his offer, showing some willingness to negotiate, it's still not enough. At this point, with several rounds of back-and-forth and Bob still offering below my minimum, I think it's wise to take John's guaranteed offer rather than risk more time in negotiations.
