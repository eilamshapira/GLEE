"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice is offering the product for $20,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum valuation of $10,000. John is offering the product for exactly $10,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.

Since Alice's initial offer is double what I'm willing to pay, I should reject her offer and make a counteroffer. This gives me a chance to negotiate a better price than John's fixed offer of $10,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that gives us room to negotiate while still being reasonable.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her price from $20,000 to $15,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but her offer is still above my maximum value of $10,000 and above John's price of $10,000.

Since Alice's current offer is higher than John's alternative, and still above my maximum valuation, I should reject and continue negotiating.
