"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. While I acknowledge the potential value of this product, I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. ",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that my initial price may have been out of your budget, and I appreciate your seriousness about the negotiation. However, I still believe the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to compromise and make a counteroffer of $2500000, which I think is more reflective of its worth. I'm open to further discussion and finding a price that works for both of us.",2500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $2500000 is still outside my range.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $800000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both recognize in this product.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand that you have a budget in mind. However, I must reiterate that the product's value to me is substantial, and I'm looking for a price that reflects its true worth. Considering your firm offer of $800000, I'm willing to make a significant concession. My counteroffer is $1400000, which I believe is a fair compromise, taking into account the value we both acknowledge in this product. I'm hopeful we can meet at this price or work out a final agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1400000 is closer to my budget, it's still a stretch.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which I believe is a fair price considering our ongoing discussions.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
