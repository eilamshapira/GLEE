Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. While I acknowledge the potential value of this product, I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us. My counteroffer will be $2,500,000. This price still reflects the high value I place on the product but shows a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement."

I understand that my initial price may have been out of your budget, and I appreciate your seriousness about the negotiation. However, I still believe the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to compromise and make a counteroffer of $2,500,000, which I think is more reflective of its worth.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $2500000 is still outside my range.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $800000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both recognize in this product.

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since he's firm on his $800,000 offer, I need to decide whether to meet him closer to his price or hold out for a higher value. Considering the product's worth to me is no less than $1,000,000, I'll try to find a middle ground that's still profitable for me. My next counteroffer will be $1,400,000, which is lower than my previous offer but still reflects the product's significant value."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand that you have a budget in mind. However, I must reiterate that the product's value to me is substantial, and I'm looking for a price that reflects its true worth. Considering your firm offer of $800,000, I'm willing to make a significant concession. My counteroffer is $1,400,000, which I believe is a fair compromise, taking into account the value we both acknowledge in this product. I'm hopeful we can meet at this price or work out a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1400000 is closer to my budget, it's still a stretch.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which I believe is a fair price considering our ongoing discussions.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Since Bob's latest offer of $1,000,000 matches the minimum value I have for the product and is the same amount I could get from selling to John, I see no benefit in continuing to negotiate or risking losing both deals. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to finalize the sale without further uncertainty."
