Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that my initial price may have been out of your budget, and I appreciate your seriousness about the negotiation. However, I still believe the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to compromise and make a counteroffer of $2500000, which I think is more reflective of its worth. I'm open to further discussion and finding a price that works for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand that you have a budget in mind. However, I must reiterate that the product's value to me is substantial, and I'm looking for a price that reflects its true worth. Considering your firm offer of $800000, I'm willing to make a significant concession.

I'm hopeful we can meet at this price or work out a final agreement.
