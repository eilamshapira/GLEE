"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice's offer of $140 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price of $100, the rational decision would be to buy from John.

John's price ($100) matches my maximum value and is $40 less than Alice's offer ($140).
