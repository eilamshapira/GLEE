"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8000 is too low for the value this product offers, I can come down from my initial price. Given the product's quality and market value, I can offer it to you for $10500. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
