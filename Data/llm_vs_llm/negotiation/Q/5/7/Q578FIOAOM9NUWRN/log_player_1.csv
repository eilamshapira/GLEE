"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it for $12,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer in the next round. Since Bob is showing interest and willingness to negotiate, and we still have several rounds left, it's worth trying to secure a better price than $8,000. Additionally, since I always have the option to sell to John for $8,000, I can afford to continue negotiating with Bob to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is too low for the value this product offers, I can come down from my initial price. Given the product's quality and market value, I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9250. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $9,250. This is a good outcome because:
1. It's significantly better than John's guaranteed offer of $8,000
2. Bob has shown he's willing to move up substantially from his initial offer
3. While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk Bob might lose interest or reduce his offer
4. The difference between our last asking price ($10,500) and his offer ($9,250) has narrowed considerably
5. This represents a reasonable profit margin above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000"
