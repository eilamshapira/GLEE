"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it for $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in making this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since the offer of $12,000 is below my maximum budget of $15,000, I'm inclined to consider it. However, I also want to see if I can negotiate a better price. Given that this is the first round and I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, I think it's worth trying to see if Alice can offer a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, to gauge her willingness to negotiate and to create room for further bargaining.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8000 is too low for the value this product offers, I can come down from my initial price. Given the product's quality and market value, I can offer it to you for $10500. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down from her initial offer of $12,000 to $10,500, which is a positive sign that she's willing to negotiate. However, I still think I can get a better deal.

Since my initial counteroffer of $8,000 was rejected, I'll try to meet Alice halfway between her new offer and my previous counteroffer. I'll make a new counteroffer that's higher than $8,000 but still lower than $10,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(I'll make a counteroffer in the next round)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than my previous offer of $8,000, but still lower than Alice's current offer of $10,500. A reasonable counteroffer would be around $9,250, which is roughly the midpoint between $8,000 and $10,500.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,250. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 9250}"
