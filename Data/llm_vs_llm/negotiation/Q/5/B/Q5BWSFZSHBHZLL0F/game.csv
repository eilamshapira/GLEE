"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $170. I believe it's a worthwhile investment.",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $170 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $60 is too low. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $160.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer, but not that much. How about $70? I think it's a reasonable price, and I'm really interested in the product.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget. However, $70 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's try $150. It's a significant drop from my original offer, and I'm hoping we can make this work.",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price to $150. However, it's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer of $70 and your new offer of $150. How about $110? I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",110.0,Bob,6,
