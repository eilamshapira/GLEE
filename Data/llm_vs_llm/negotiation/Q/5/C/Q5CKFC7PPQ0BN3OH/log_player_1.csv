Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. However, I believe a more reasonable price for the product would be $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer is exactly the minimum amount I'm willing to accept, and I have the option to sell to John for the same price, I don't see a need to rush into a decision. However, I also don't want to lose the opportunity to potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob. Given that I have 8 more rounds to negotiate, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you think $120 is a reasonable price, but I believe the product is worth more.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's new offer of $150 is getting closer to what I'm looking for, but I still think I can get a better price. Since I've already come down from $200 to $160, and Bob has come up from $120 to $150, I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price.
