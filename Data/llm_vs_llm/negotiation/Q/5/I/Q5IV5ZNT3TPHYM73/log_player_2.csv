"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given my constraints, Alice's offer of $1,000,000 exceeds the maximum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me. Since John is offering to sell me the same product for exactly $800,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay, the logical choice is to buy from John.
