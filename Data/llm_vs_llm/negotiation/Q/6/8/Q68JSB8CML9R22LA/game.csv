"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its features and market value, I'm pricing it at $22000. This is a competitive price for the value this product provides. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was looking to spend no more than $5000 on this product. Would you be willing to sell it for this price?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $5000 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. The product has outstanding features and quality that justify a higher price point. I understand you have budget constraints, but I simply can't go that low. I could come down to $19500, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value.",19500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $19500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $6000. This is a fair amount considering my budget and the potential uses I have for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but $6000 is still far below what this product is worth. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $15000 for it. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. My absolute minimum price would be $17500, which is still a significant reduction from my initial offer. This product has exceptional value that justifies this price point. Can you meet me closer to this figure?",17500.0,Alice,5,
