Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $5000 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. The product has outstanding features and quality that justify a higher price point. I understand you have budget constraints, but I simply can't go that low. I could come down to $19500, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,500

Counteroffer: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $19,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $6,000. This is a fair amount considering my budget and the potential uses I have for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but $6000 is still far below what this product is worth. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $15000 for it. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. My absolute minimum price would be $17500, which is still a significant reduction from my initial offer. This product has exceptional value that justifies this price point. Can you meet me closer to this figure?
