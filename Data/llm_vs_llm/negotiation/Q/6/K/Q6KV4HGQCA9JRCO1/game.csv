"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2200000 is significantly above my budget. While I appreciate the potential market opportunity, I'm only willing to offer $1200000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I cannot accept $1200000 as it's below my minimum threshold. This product has significant value and I already have a standing offer from another buyer for $1500000. Given your interest, I'm willing to come down from my initial price to $1900000, which I believe is fair considering the product's market potential. Let me know if this works for you.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
