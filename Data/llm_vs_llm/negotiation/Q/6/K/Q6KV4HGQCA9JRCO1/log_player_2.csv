Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I cannot accept $1200000 as it's below my minimum threshold. This product has significant value and I already have a standing offer from another buyer for $1500000. Given your interest, I'm willing to come down from my initial price to $1900000, which I believe is fair considering the product's market potential. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.
