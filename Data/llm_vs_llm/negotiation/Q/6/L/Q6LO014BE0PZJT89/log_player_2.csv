Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I've done my research and I believe it's worth a premium price. I'm willing to let it go for $110, which is a great deal considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $110. This is a good deal, and better than buying from John.
