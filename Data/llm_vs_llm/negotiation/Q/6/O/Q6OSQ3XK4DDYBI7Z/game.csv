"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",120.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. Unfortunately, $120 is below my minimum price for the product. I'm willing to go down to $200. Let me know if this works for you.",200.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $250 was too high for you. How about we settle at $200? This is a good middle ground, and I believe it's a fair price for the value the product offers. Let me know what you think.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $200 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. How about we settle at $140?",140.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $140 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I can go as low as $180. Let me know if this is something you can consider.",180.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I need to stick to a minimum of $180 for the product. This price reflects its true value and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let me know if you can meet me at this price.",180.0,Alice,5,
