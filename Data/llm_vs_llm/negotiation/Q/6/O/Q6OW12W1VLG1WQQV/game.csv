"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $10000. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $10500. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. Considering your last offer and my previous counteroffer, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we settle on $11000? This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
