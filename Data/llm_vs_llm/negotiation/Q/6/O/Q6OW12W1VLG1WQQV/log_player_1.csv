"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you at a competitive price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12000 is above what I'm willing to spend. How about we negotiate to a price of $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is the minimum value I have for the product, and selling it to John would also be for $10,000, I don't see a benefit in selling to John at this point. However, I also don't want to accept Bob's offer immediately without trying to negotiate a better price. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $10,000. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of meeting in the middle between my initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we settle on $11,500?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I still feel that $11500 is too high for me. How about I offer you $10500 instead? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with, but I still believe the product is worth more to him than that. Since I know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to meet him closer to the middle of our last two offers.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $10,500. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. Considering your last offer and my previous counteroffer, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we settle on $11,000? This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. However, $11000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $10800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $10,800 is very close to my last counteroffer of $11,000. At this point, I think it's a good price, considering we've been negotiating for several rounds. Accepting this offer would also avoid the risk of Bob walking away or making a lower offer in the next round. Given that selling to John would only get me $10,000, I think accepting Bob's offer of $10,800 is the best decision.
