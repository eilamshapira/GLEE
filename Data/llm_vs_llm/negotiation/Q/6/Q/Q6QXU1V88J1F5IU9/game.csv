"Hello Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $2000000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something of great value. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm very interested in the product, $2000000 is beyond my budget. I could consider purchasing it for $500000.  This represents a substantial investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price.",500000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $500000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to lower my initial offer to $1800000, considering your budget constraints. Please let me know if this works for you.",1800000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1800000 might still be a stretch. Let's try to meet halfway. How about $1650000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to work with you on this deal.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price, but $1650000 is still considerably more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm serious about buying this product, but my absolute upper limit is closer to $600000. Let's try to find a number that works for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I see that you're serious about this purchase, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, $600000 is still below our minimum threshold. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1550000? This is very close to my bottom line, and I believe it could be a fair deal for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. Given your budget constraints and my need to meet a certain threshold, I'm willing to go down to $1525000. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",1525000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, but $1525000 is still significantly outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $650000.  This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal soon.",650000.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $650000 is still not feasible for us. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1510000, which is the lowest I can go while still meeting our needs. Please consider this offer seriously, as it's my final attempt to reach an agreement with you.",1510000.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close to the limit of what's possible for both of us. I'm willing to make one last adjustment to $1505000. This is absolutely the lowest I can go. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. Please let me know your decision.",1505000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your efforts, we're still quite far apart.  I can go up to $700000, but that's my absolute limit.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to pursue other options. I do prefer to work with you, so I hope we can find a solution.",700000.0,Bob,8,
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but $700000 is still below our minimum threshold. I've gone as low as I can with my last offer of $1505000. Since we can't seem to reach an agreement, I will have to consider selling to another buyer. Thank you for your interest.",1505000.0,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're at an impasse. My last offer was $1505000, and I cannot go any lower. If you can meet or come close to this price, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I will need to sell to another buyer. Please let me know your decision.",1505000.0,Alice,9,
