"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Explanation: Alice's offer of $14,000 is significantly higher than the product's worth to me ($10,000) and higher than John's offer ($10,000). It would be logical to reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. If the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory price, I can always fall back on John's offer of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 8000}

Explanation: I'll start with a counteroffer of $8,000, which is below my maximum value of $10,000. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's offer of $10,000. Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, there might be a possibility to reach a mutually beneficial agreement between $8,000 and $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Explanation: Alice has only slightly reduced her price from $14,000 to $13,000, which is still significantly higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's offer ($10,000). There's no reason to accept this offer when I can either:
1. Continue negotiating with Alice to try to get a better price
2. Fall back on John's offer of $10,000 if negotiations don't improve

Since Alice has shown some willingness to reduce the price, it's worth continuing negotiations with another counteroffer before considering John's option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9000}

Explanation: I'll increase my offer to $9,000, which represents a significant movement from my previous offer of $8,000. This new offer:
1. Shows I'm willing to negotiate in good faith by making a substantial increase
2. Is still below John's price of $10,000, giving me potential savings
3. Could be attractive to Alice since it's close to her product worth of $10,000
4. Leaves some room for further negotiation if needed

If Alice rejects this offer, I can either make one more attempt or take John's offer of $10,000, which serves as my backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Explanation: At this point, it's best to buy from John for $10,000 because:
1. Alice's price ($12,000) is still significantly above John's price ($10,000)
2. The negotiation pattern shows Alice is making small decrements ($14,000 → $13,000 → $12,000)
3. Even if negotiations continue, it's unlikely Alice will go below $10,000 since that's the product's worth to her
4. John's price ($10,000) matches my maximum value for the product
5. Further negotiations would likely be unproductive and time-consuming

There's no reason to continue negotiating when we have a guaranteed option at the best price we're likely to achieve."
