Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my strategy carefully here. I know my product is worth at least $10,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price. When making an offer to Bob, I should set a price that's higher than my guaranteed $10,000, because that's my fallback option.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll set a price that gives me a meaningful premium over my guaranteed sale while still being potentially acceptable to Bob.
