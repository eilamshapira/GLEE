"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $1,200,000 against my alternatives.

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and I can buy the same product from John for exactly $800,000.

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 exceeds both my maximum valuation and John's price, so accepting Alice's offer would be financially unwise.
