"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Looking at Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000, I notice this is exactly the same as my maximum value for the product and also the same as John's alternative price. Since I can get a better deal by negotiating with Alice (who values the product at only $800,000), I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives Alice some profit but also saves me money compared to my maximum price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has dropped her price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000, which is a significant reduction. This is $150,000 less than my maximum value and John's price. I could accept this, but there's still room to negotiate since Alice's cost is $800,000. I'll reject and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has moved down to $1,050,000 from $1,200,000, which shows willingness to negotiate. I'll increase my previous offer to move closer to her position while still trying to get a good deal.

{""product_price"": $950,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her price again to $1,000,000, which is $200,000 less than my maximum value and John's price. This represents a fair split of the surplus between our values ($800,000 to $1,200,000). Alice would make a $200,000 profit, and I would save $200,000 compared to buying from John. This is a reasonable deal, so I'll accept.
