Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider the situation carefully. 

The product is worth at least $150 to me, and Bob values it at $100. If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell to John for $150.

Since Bob only values the product at $100, any price I offer above $100 will be rejected, as it wouldn't make economic sense for Bob to pay more than the product's value to him. If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell to John for $150, which is the minimum value I'd accept anyway.

Therefore, the rational choice is to offer Bob a price that matches John's offer.
