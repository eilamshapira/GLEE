"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a product that is of high quality and value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Are you interested?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice, but $150 is too high for me. I'm looking to spend no more than $100. Can you do $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I can't go as low as $60. This product is actually worth significantly more than that, and I have another buyer willing to pay $120 for it. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can come down to $135. This is already a good discount from my initial offer.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but $135 is still too high for me. I can come up to $70. Let's meet in the middle.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you raising your offer, but $70 is still well below what this product is worth. As I mentioned, I already have an offer for $120 from another buyer. Since I'd like to do business with you, I can come down to $125, which is just slightly above my other offer. This is the best I can do considering the product's value and my other options.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to raise my offer to $80. This is a fair price considering my budget and your other offer. Let's find some middle ground.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. My bottom line is $120, which is exactly what my other buyer John is willing to pay. If you can meet me at this price, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to proceed with my other option. This is my final offer based on the product's value and my alternative.",120.0,Alice,7,
