"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, that's a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $50 for the product. Would you accept this price?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $50 is significantly below the product's actual value. This is a high-quality item that I cannot sell for less than $150. I've reduced my initial asking price, taking your budget into consideration. Would you be able to meet me at this price point?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks again, Alice. I understand you value the product. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. The absolute most I can offer is $75.  Let me know if that works.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I've already reduced my price substantially, and I simply cannot go below $135 as that would be too close to my cost. This is a high-quality product that provides excellent value at this price point. Can you meet me at $135?",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm really trying to stick to a strict budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $85, but that's my final offer. Take it or leave it.",85.0,Bob,6,
