"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in the product, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I can offer you a discount from my original price, but I need to get closer to the product's value. Let me think for a moment... Alright, I can offer it to you for $160.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the discount, Alice. However, $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $120?",120.0,Bob,4,
