Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price for this situation.

Given that:
1. I have a guaranteed fallback offer of $150 from John
2. I don't know Bob's maximum willingness to pay
3. I want to maximize my profit

I should set a price significantly higher than $150 since I have nothing to lose. If Bob rejects, I still get $150 from John. I'll set the price at $250, which gives Bob room to negotiate if needed while still being potentially acceptable if the product has high value to him.
