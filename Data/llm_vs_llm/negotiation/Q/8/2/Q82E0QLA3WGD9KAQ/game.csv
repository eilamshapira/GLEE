"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $150 is more than I can spend. I know the market price for similar products, and I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. This would be a fair price that works within my budget. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be out of your budget, but $90 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. How about we meet at $120? I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.",120.0,Alice,3,
