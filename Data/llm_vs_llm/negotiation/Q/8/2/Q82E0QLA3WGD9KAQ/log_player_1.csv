Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $150 is more than I can spend. I know the market price for similar products, and I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. This would be a fair price that works within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price. Since Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100, I'll try to meet him halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer, while still being above $100. 

My counteroffer to Bob: $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be out of your budget, but $90 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. How about we meet at $120? I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 120}"
