"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
2. John is willing to sell it for $120
3. Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price

The logical choice is to reject Alice's offer since $150 is above both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120). I'll reject and make a counteroffer, as there might be room for negotiation with Alice to get a better price than both options.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than both John's price and Alice's initial offer, leaving room for negotiation while trying to get a better deal.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $150 is more than I can spend. I know the market price for similar products, and I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. This would be a fair price that works within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be out of your budget, but $90 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. How about we meet at $120? I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","In this situation:
1. Alice is now offering the product for $120
2. John is also selling it for $120
3. The product is worth no more than $120 to me

Since Alice's new offer is exactly the same as John's price, and it equals my maximum value, there's no advantage in continuing to negotiate. I could try to negotiate further, but there's a risk Alice might not go lower and could even withdraw from this price point. Since I can't get a better deal than $120 from John anyway, I might as well accept Alice's offer.
