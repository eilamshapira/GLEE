"Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. Let me know if we can work something out.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $10000 is too low. My absolute bottom line is $12000, as I have another buyer willing to pay that. However, I value our potential business relationship. Let's meet in the middle a bit. I can offer it to you for $14000. This still gives you a $1000 benefit.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet in the middle. However, $14000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering your absolute bottom line is $12000, I'd like to propose a price of $11500. This way, we can both walk away with a mutually beneficial deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
