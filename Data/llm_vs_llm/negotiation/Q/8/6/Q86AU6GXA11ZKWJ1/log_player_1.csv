Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $10,000 is too low. My absolute bottom line is $12,000, as I have another buyer willing to pay that.

Round 4

Considering your absolute bottom line is $12000, I'd like to propose a price of $11500. This way, we can both walk away with a mutually beneficial deal.
