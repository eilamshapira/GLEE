"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is offering the product at her value of $10,000. Since you can get it for $8,000 from John, it makes the most sense to buy from John and save the $2,000."
