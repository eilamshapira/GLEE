"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $250 is quite high for me. Given that similar products are available in the market for much less, I can offer $120 for it. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate it. However, I can't go that low. Considering the quality and the unique features of this product, the lowest I can go is $220. How about that?",220.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're emphasizing the quality, Alice, but I need to be honest - I can get the same product from another seller for $150. I'd like to buy from you, so I can offer $135, which would save me some money while still giving you a good deal. What do you say?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but I also know the value of what I'm offering. Let's meet in the middle. How about $190? It's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's unique advantages.",190.0,Alice,5,
