"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! Considering its value and quality, I'm offering it to you for $250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll reject Alice's offer of $250 since it's significantly higher than my maximum value of $150, and even higher than John's fixed price of $150.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but still gives room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $250 is quite high for me. Given that similar products are available in the market for much less, I can offer $120 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate it. However, I can't go that low. Considering the quality and the unique features of this product, the lowest I can go is $220. How about that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $220. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $220
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's offer of $220 is still well above both my maximum value ($150) and John's price ($150). There's no reason to accept this offer when I can get it for $150 from John. I'll reject and try one more counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I understand you're emphasizing the quality, Alice, but I need to be honest - I can get the same product from another seller for $150. I'd like to buy from you, so I can offer $135, which would save me some money while still giving you a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, but I also know the value of what I'm offering. Let's meet in the middle. How about $190? It's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's unique advantages. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $190. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $190
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice is still not willing to meet at a reasonable price, and her offer of $190 is still above both my maximum value ($150) and John's price ($150). At this point, it's clear that Alice is unlikely to match or beat John's price, so the most rational decision is to buy from John.
