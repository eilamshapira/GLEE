Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to maximize my profit.  This will give Bob a chance to negotiate if he finds the price too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm counteroffering at my minimum value.  This should give Bob a chance to come up with a more reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop my price significantly lower than my minimum. I think I'm better off selling to John at this point."
