"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $1,200,000 to both Bob and me, and I have John's guaranteed offer at $1,200,000, I'll start with a higher price to test Bob's willingness to pay more.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $1,000,000 since it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and below John's guaranteed offer.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since my first offer of $1,500,000 was too high for Bob, and his offer of $1,000,000 was too low, I'll try a more moderate price that still gives me some profit above John's guaranteed offer.
