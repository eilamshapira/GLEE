"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $10000. This is a great deal considering its value and quality. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since the product is worth $12,000 to me and Alice's initial offer is $10,000, which is still a bit high considering Alice's own value for the product is $8,000, I think I can try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. Considering the product's value to me and Alice's initial offer, I think a fair price would be somewhere in between. Since Alice's value for the product is $8,000, I'll start by offering a price that's slightly higher than that, hoping to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the product's value justifies a higher price. I can go down to $9500, which is a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has made a counteroffer of $9,500, which is closer to my target price but still a bit higher than I'd like. Since I know the product's value to Alice is $8,000 and I'm willing to pay up to $12,000, I think there's still room for negotiation.

I'll reject Alice's current offer and try to make another counteroffer, hoping to meet in the middle.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer to Alice. Considering her previous offer of $9,500 and my previous offer of $9,000, I'll try to split the difference and see if we can meet at a price that's more comfortable for both of us.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still very interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and yours. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9,250?"", ""product_price"": 9250}"
