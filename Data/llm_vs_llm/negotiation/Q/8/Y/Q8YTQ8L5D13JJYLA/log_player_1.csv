Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $800,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and I know I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so there's no reason to accept this low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm lowering my initial offer but still maintaining a price well above my minimum threshold, giving room for further negotiation while ensuring a potentially better profit than John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still significantly below the $1,000,000 I can get from John. Since Bob has increased his offer from $800,000 to $850,000, there's a chance he might continue increasing his offer. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, but if Bob doesn't come close to or exceed $1,000,000 soon, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'm continuing to gradually lower my asking price to show willingness to negotiate, but I'm still maintaining a price well above my $1,000,000 minimum threshold. This gives Bob room to make a higher counteroffer while still potentially giving me better returns than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offers are gradually increasing ($800k -> $850k -> $900k), but they're still below John's guaranteed $1,000,000. With 4 rounds remaining, I'll make one more attempt at negotiating with Bob, but if he doesn't reach at least $1,000,000 soon, I'll need to seriously consider taking John's offer to avoid risking a worse outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1100000}

I've lowered my asking price significantly to show strong willingness to close the deal, but I'm still keeping it above John's offer of $1,000,000. Given Bob's pattern of increasing offers and that we're in the later rounds, this price point might encourage him to make an offer at or above $1,000,000. If he doesn't, I'll likely take John's offer rather than risk further negotiation."
