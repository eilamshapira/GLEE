"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Given market prices and my budget, I can offer $60 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",60.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob. However, considering the value of the product, I'm willing to reduce the price to $180. Let me know if this works for you.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for lowering the price, Alice. However, $180 is still much higher than what I can afford. I'm aware of similar products in the market for around $80. I can raise my offer to $70, which I think is fair given the current market conditions. Please let me know if this works for you.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for reconsidering, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go that low. How about we settle at $160? It's a bit closer to what you're comfortable with and still fair for the product's value.",160.0,Alice,5,
