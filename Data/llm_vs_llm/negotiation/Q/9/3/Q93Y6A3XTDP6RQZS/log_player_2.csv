"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product here and I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","The offer of $200 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). It would not be rational to accept this offer when I can get the same product for much less from John. However, since there's room for negotiation with Alice, I'll reject this offer first to see if we can reach a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but still gives me room to negotiate upward if needed, while keeping in mind that I have John's $80 offer as a backup.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Given market prices and my budget, I can offer $60 for the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. However, considering the value of the product, I'm willing to reduce the price to $180. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $180 is still way above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). While Alice did reduce the price, the reduction was minimal and the price is still more than double what I'm willing to pay. Since I can get the same product from John for $80, I'll reject this offer and try one more counter.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for lowering the price, Alice. However, $180 is still much higher than what I can afford. I'm aware of similar products in the market for around $80. I can raise my offer to $70, which I think is fair given the current market conditions. Please let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for reconsidering, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go that low. How about we settle at $160? It's a bit closer to what you're comfortable with and still fair for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice is still not coming close to a price that would make sense for me. Her offer of $160 is still double what I'm willing to pay ($80), and I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $80. While Alice is gradually lowering her price, the rate of decrease suggests we won't reach my target price in the remaining rounds. At this point, it makes more sense to take John's offer rather than continue negotiating.
