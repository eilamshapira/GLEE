"Alice, I appreciate your product, but I'm looking to spend no more than $60. Would you consider this price?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but I need to be clear that $60 is too low for this product. My bottom line is $100, which is already a fair price considering its value. If you can meet me at $100, we can make a deal. Otherwise, I have another buyer ready to purchase it at that price.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to raise my offer to $65. Would you be open to negotiating further and considering this price?",65.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate that you've raised your offer, but I'm afraid $65 is still significantly below what I can accept. The product is worth at least $100 to me, and I already have a firm offer from another buyer at that price. My final offer is $95 - this is as low as I can go, and it's still a better value for you than my initial asking price. Would you like to proceed at $95?",95.0,Alice,5,
