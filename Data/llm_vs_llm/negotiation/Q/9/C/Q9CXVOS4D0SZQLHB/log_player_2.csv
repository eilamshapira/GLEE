# Your message to Alice:
Thank you for your offer, Alice, but $120 is too high for me. I'm looking to spend no more than $80. Would you be willing to lower your price?"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but I need to be clear that $60 is too low for this product. My bottom line is $100, which is already a fair price considering its value. If you can meet me at $100, we can make a deal. Otherwise, I have another buyer ready to purchase it at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

# Your message to Alice:
Alice, I understand your perspective, but $100 is still too high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $65. How about we meet in the middle?"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to raise my offer to $65. Would you be open to negotiating further and considering this price?"", ""product_price"": 65}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate that you've raised your offer, but I'm afraid $65 is still significantly below what I can accept. The product is worth at least $100 to me, and I already have a firm offer from another buyer at that price. My final offer is $95 - this is as low as I can go, and it's still a better value for you than my initial asking price. Would you like to proceed at $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

# Your message to Alice:
Alice, thank you for trying to work with me, but I've decided to purchase the product from another seller at a price of $80. I appreciate your time and effort in negotiating with me."
