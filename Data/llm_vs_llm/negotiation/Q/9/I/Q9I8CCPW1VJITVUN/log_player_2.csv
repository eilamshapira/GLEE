"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $15,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's alternative price ($12,000). It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice than the $12,000 alternative from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9000}

I'll offer $9,000, which is significantly below John's price of $12,000. This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's offer. If Alice's cost is low enough, she might be willing to accept a price below $12,000, and even if she counters higher, we can still negotiate to a price that's better than John's $12,000 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $12,000. Here's why:
1. The price matches John's alternative offer of $12,000
2. There's no guarantee that further negotiation would yield a better price
3. Alice has already come down significantly from her initial offer of $15,000 to match the market price
4. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal or wasting rounds only to end up paying the same price anyway

Since we can't get better than $12,000 from John, and Alice is now offering the same price, it's reasonable to accept this offer and conclude the negotiation."
