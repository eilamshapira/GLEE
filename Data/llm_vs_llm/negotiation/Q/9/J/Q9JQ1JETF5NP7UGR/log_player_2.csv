"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product I believe you would be interested in. It's truly unique and offers [briefly mention key benefits for Bob],  I'm offering it to you for $20000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $15,000
2. Alice is offering the product for $20,000
3. John is offering the same product for $15,000
4. If I accept Alice's offer, I would be paying $5,000 more than my maximum value
5. John's offer matches my maximum value

Since Alice's offer ($20,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($15,000) and John's alternative offer ($15,000), the rational decision would be to buy from John.
