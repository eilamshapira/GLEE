"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I certainly understand Bob's perspective, but I believe the product's value is higher.

How about this:

{""product_price"": 8500}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 8500}

Bob, I understand that you might want a lower price, but I believe that $8500 is a fair valuation for the product. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure will meet your expectations. I am prepared to negotiate but I am not prepared to sell the product for less then $8,000"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

That works for me, Bob. I appreciate a good negotiation.
Let's proceed with the sale."
