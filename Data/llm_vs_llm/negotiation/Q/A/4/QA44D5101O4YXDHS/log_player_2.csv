"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be a great fit for you. After careful consideration, I've set a competitive price for the product. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to analyze this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $15,000, but it's worth no more than $12,000 to me. Additionally, I have the option to buy the same product from John for $12,000.

Since Alice's offer ($15,000) exceeds both my maximum valuation ($12,000) and John's guaranteed price ($12,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. While I could try to negotiate with Alice, I already know that John will sell me the product at my maximum valuation price.
