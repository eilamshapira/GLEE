Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $150 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a higher price to maximize my potential profit.

{""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable value of $150, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, it would not be rational to accept Bob's offer. I also know I can always fall back on John's offer, so there's no risk in continuing to negotiate with Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a new counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still keep it well above my minimum value of $150, giving room for potential further negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer of $110 is still well below my minimum acceptable value of $150, and I have John's guaranteed offer at $150. Since Bob's second offer only increased by $10 from his first offer, it seems he might not be willing to reach a price point that would be acceptable to me. At this point, it would be wise to take John's guaranteed offer rather than continue negotiations that may not be productive.
