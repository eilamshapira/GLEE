"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to analyze this situation carefully. Alice's opening offer is $1,100,000, which is significantly above the maximum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me. In fact, it's $300,000 more than my maximum valuation, and also $300,000 more than John's guaranteed price.

Since I know I can always buy from John for $800,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer. I should either try to negotiate with Alice or go straight to John.

Given that I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and Alice values the product at $1,200,000, there's potential to reach a deal that benefits both of us. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that acknowledges the value to both parties. Since I know Alice values the product at $1,200,000 and I can get it elsewhere for $800,000, I'll aim for something in between that might be attractive to both of us.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her price from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but her offer is still $250,000 above what I can pay to John. This is still far above my maximum valuation of $800,000 for the product.

Given that I can purchase the product from John for $800,000, and Alice's current offer is significantly higher than that, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her price again to $1,000,000, showing she's continuing to negotiate. However, this is still $200,000 above what I can pay to John and above my maximum valuation of $800,000.

Since I can purchase the product from John for $800,000, and Alice's current offer exceeds that significantly, I'll continue negotiating.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice continues to lower her price, now offering $975,000. While this shows progress in our negotiation, it's still $175,000 above John's price of $800,000 and above my maximum valuation.

Given that we still have a few rounds left to negotiate, and the option to buy from John remains available, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.
