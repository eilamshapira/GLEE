I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This gives him a good deal, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to him, while still ensuring I get a significant profit above my minimum of $1,000,000.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,300,000. This is a compromise, closer to his offer, but still ensures I make a decent profit. I'm hoping this will be the sweet spot for a deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still slightly below my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise. I'm confident I can still make a good profit, and it's better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  Let's finalize this deal!"
