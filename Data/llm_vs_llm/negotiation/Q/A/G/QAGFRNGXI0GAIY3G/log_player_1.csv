Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. How about $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, I'm holding out for a bit more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $130?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 130}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I have a budget in mind. Could we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, $120 is my minimum, and it's better than selling to John for the same price."
