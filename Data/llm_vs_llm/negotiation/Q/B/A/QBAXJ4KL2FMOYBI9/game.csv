"Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. I'm interested in buying it, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but $80 is too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $150. This way, we both give a little and get a good deal. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your suggestion to meet in the middle, but $150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering I can buy the product from John for $100, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I'm hoping this price is more reasonable for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
