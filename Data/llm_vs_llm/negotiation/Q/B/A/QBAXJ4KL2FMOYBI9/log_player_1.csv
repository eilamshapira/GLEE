Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your suggestion to meet in the middle, but $150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering I can buy the product from John for $100, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I'm hoping this price is more reasonable for both of us.
