"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given that the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me and John is offering it at $12,000, while Alice's offer is $15,000, it would not be rational to accept Alice's higher price. Since I can get the product from John at a lower price that matches my maximum valuation, I should buy from John.
