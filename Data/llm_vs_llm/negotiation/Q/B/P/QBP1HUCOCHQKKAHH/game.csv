"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I think $13000 is a bit higher than what I'm looking to spend. How about we settle for $10000 instead? Let me know your thoughts.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer.  How about $12500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both get a good deal. Let's finalize this!",12500.0,Alice,3,
