Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I think $13000 is a bit higher than what I'm looking to spend. How about we settle for $10000 instead? Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

That's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both get a good deal. Let's finalize this!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
