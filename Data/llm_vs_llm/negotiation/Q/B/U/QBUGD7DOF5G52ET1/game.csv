"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is too low for the value of this product. How about we meet halfway at $120? I believe this price is fair considering the benefits you will gain from it.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the new offer. I understand your perspective, but $120 is still beyond what I can spend. I can offer $70 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable.",70.0,Bob,4,
