"Hello Bob, I'm excited about the possibility of you acquiring this exceptional product. I believe it will be a valuable asset to you. Given its unique qualities and the value it provides, I'm offering it to you for $9500.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I need to be transparent - the product is worth no more than $8000 to me. In fact, I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the identical product for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you consider selling it for $7000? This would give me an incentive to choose you over the alternative.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your transparency and understand your position. While $7000 is lower than I can accept, I genuinely value the prospect of doing business with you as well. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $8750? This reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to be practical about this purchase. As I mentioned, I can get this exact product from John for $8000, which is already the maximum value of this product to me. To make it worthwhile to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $7500. This would give me a reason to choose you over John while still being a fair price for the product.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your situation and appreciate you working with me. While $7500 is still below my minimum, I'm willing to meet you closer to your valuation. Let's try $8300. This represents a significant compromise on my end and allows you to acquire the product from me.",8300.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $8300. We're getting closer, but I'm still in a position where I'd be paying more than the $8000 I can get the identical product for from John. Since the product is worth exactly $8000 to me, paying more than that would be a net loss. My best offer is $7800. This still gives you a better deal than selling it elsewhere for $8000 (which you mentioned is your cost), while giving me a small incentive to purchase from you rather than your competitor.",7800.0,Bob,6,
