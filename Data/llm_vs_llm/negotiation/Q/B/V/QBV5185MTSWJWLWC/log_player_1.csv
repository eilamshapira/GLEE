Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I need to be transparent - the product is worth no more than $8000 to me. In fact, I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the identical product for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you consider selling it for $7000? This would give me an incentive to choose you over the alternative. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to be practical about this purchase. As I mentioned, I can get this exact product from John for $8000, which is already the maximum value of this product to me. To make it worthwhile to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $7500. This would give me a reason to choose you over John while still being a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your situation and appreciate you working with me. While $7,500 is still below my minimum, I'm willing to meet you closer to your valuation. Let's try $8,300. This represents a significant compromise on my end and allows you to acquire the product from me."", ""product_price"": 8300}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $8300. We're getting closer, but I'm still in a position where I'd be paying more than the $8000 I can get the identical product for from John. Since the product is worth exactly $8000 to me, paying more than that would be a net loss. My best offer is $7800. This still gives you a better deal than selling it elsewhere for $8000 (which you mentioned is your cost), while giving me a small incentive to purchase from you rather than your competitor. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800.
