"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice is offering the product for $10,000, which is actually the maximum amount the product is worth to her. However, this product is only worth up to $8,000 to me, so accepting Alice's offer would mean I'm paying more than the product's value to me.

John is offering the product for $8,000, which is exactly the maximum I value the product.

I could reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, but there's no guarantee Alice will accept a price below $10,000, and even if we negotiate, the best I could hope for is $8,000 (which John is already offering).

Since Alice's current offer exceeds my maximum valuation, and John's price matches my maximum valuation, the rational choice is:
