"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
Since Alice is offering the product for the maximum price you're willing to pay, it makes more sense to buy from John at the same price. This avoids the risk of potentially overpaying if you continue negotiating with Alice."
