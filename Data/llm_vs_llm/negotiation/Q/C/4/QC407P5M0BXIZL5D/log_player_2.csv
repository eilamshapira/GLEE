"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of $20,000, reject it, or buy from John for $15,000.

Given that:
- The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
- John is offering the product for $15,000
- Alice is offering the product for $20,000

Alice's offer ($20,000) exceeds both the product's worth to me and John's price. The rational choice is to buy from John for $15,000, which matches the maximum value of the product to me.
