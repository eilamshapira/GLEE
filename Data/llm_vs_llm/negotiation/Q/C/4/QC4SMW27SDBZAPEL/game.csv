,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to my business. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I acknowledge the value you see in the product, $1200000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm proposing a price of $1350000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $1350000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1275000. This price still reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise between our two positions. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1275000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $1312500?  It's a fair price considering the value of this unique opportunity.",1312500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your suggestion to meet in the middle at $1312500. However, I was thinking we could meet a bit closer to my previous offer. How about $1290000? I believe this price is still a fair compromise and reflects the value I see in the product. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1290000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm happy to see we're getting closer to a deal.  Your offer of $1290000 is still a bit lower than I'd like.  To keep the negotiation moving, I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
