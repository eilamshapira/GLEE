"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $50. Would you be willing to consider that?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in the product, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but $50 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a better price. Let me think for a moment... How about we meet not exactly in the middle, but somewhere closer, between my original offer and your counteroffer? I can do $200.",200.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from $250 to $200, but it's still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer of $50 and your new offer of $200. That would put us at $125. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for that price?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your new offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $175. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. I'm open to finalizing the deal if we can agree on this price.",175.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I understand that $175 is the lowest price you're comfortable with, but it's still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, considering I can buy the product from John for $80. I'd like to offer $150, which is a significant increase from my previous offers. If you're willing to sell the product to me for this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",150.0,Bob,6,
