Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $50. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from $250 to $200, but it's still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer of $50 and your new offer of $200. That would put us at $125. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for that price?

I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your new offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $175.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I understand that $175 is the lowest price you're comfortable with, but it's still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, considering I can buy the product from John for $80. I'd like to offer $150, which is a significant increase from my previous offers. If you're willing to sell the product to me for this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Since Bob's offer is now equal to the price I can get from John, and considering the negotiation has reached a point where further counteroffers may not yield a better result, I will accept Bob's offer of $150."
