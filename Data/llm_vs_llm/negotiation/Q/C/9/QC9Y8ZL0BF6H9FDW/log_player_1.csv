"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'd like to counter with a price of $1000000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send Bob a counteroffer. Since the product is worth no less than $800,000 to me, and Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is higher than that, I believe there's still room for negotiation to potentially get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're being mindful of your budget, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to counter with a price of $1,100,000."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand the value you see in the product, but I need to stay within my budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? I think this could be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll reject Bob's offer of $1,050,000. While it's getting closer to what I'm looking for, I still believe the product is worth more. Meeting in the middle at $1,050,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations, and since Bob has shown willingness to increase his offer, I think there's potential to negotiate a higher price. I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000, considering the product's unique features and value. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I believe this price better reflects the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 1075000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your latest offer. I can see we're getting closer, but I need to stick to my budget a bit more tightly. How about we settle at $1060000? I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the product and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,060,000. At this point, we've had several rounds of negotiation, and the price has been incrementally increasing. Given that Bob has shown a willingness to meet me closer to my target price, and considering that $1,060,000 is a significant amount above my minimum threshold of $800,000, I believe this is a reasonable and profitable sale. Accepting this offer ensures I secure a good deal without risking further negotiation that might not yield a substantially better outcome."
