"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $170. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer of $170 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($100) and John's price ($100), it wouldn't be rational to accept this offer. Additionally, since John is offering the product at $100, which matches my maximum valuation, it would be more sensible to buy from John rather than continue negotiating with Alice, as there's no guarantee she would go below $100 (given the product is worth $120 to her).
