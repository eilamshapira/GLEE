"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $18000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market demand and the product's value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, and I understand where you're coming from. However, $8000 is below the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product. Given its quality and the value it brings, how about we agree on $15000? I believe this price reflects a good compromise for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the compromise, but $15000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and still reflects a fair value for the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
