"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $12000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $7000.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're working with a budget. While $7000 is lower than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to meet you in the middle a bit. How about $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $11000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I have a firm upper limit of $7500. How about that?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about your budget. While $7500 is still below what I'm aiming for, I value your interest in the product. Let's try to find a number that works for both of us. I can come down to $10500, but that's my absolute lowest.",10500.0,Alice,5,
