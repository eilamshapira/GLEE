"Hi Bob, I hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out regarding the exclusive product I have available. I wanted to let you know that I have another interested buyer at a firm price of $1200000, but I’m giving you the first opportunity to acquire it at the same price. Please let me know if you'd like to proceed with this offer.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate you giving me the first opportunity, $1200000 is quite high for my budget. Given that I'm ready to make an immediate purchase and can guarantee a swift transaction, I'd like to offer $900000 for the product. This would be beneficial for both of us as it ensures a quick and straightforward deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move quickly on this. However, given the product’s unique value and the fact that another buyer is ready at my fallback price, I must stick to its true worth. I'm countering with a price of $1200000—this reflects both the market value and the quality of the product. Let me know if you’re prepared to proceed at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position regarding the product's value. While I respect that you have another interested buyer, I can close this deal immediately. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1050000 in cash, with the ability to complete the transaction right away. This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and provides you with certainty and immediate payment. Would you consider this as a fair compromise?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
