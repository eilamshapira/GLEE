"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out regarding the exclusive product I have available. I wanted to let you know that I have another interested buyer at a firm price of $1200000, but I’m giving you the first opportunity to acquire it at the same price. Please let me know if you'd like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given that Alice's offer and John's price are both $1,200,000, there's no advantage in accepting Alice's current offer since I can get the same price from John. However, by rejecting Alice's offer, I have the opportunity to negotiate a better price in the next round. Since I have nothing to lose by attempting to negotiate (I can always fall back on John's offer), I should reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to appear unreasonable.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate you giving me the first opportunity, $1,200,000 is quite high for my budget. Given that I'm ready to make an immediate purchase and can guarantee a swift transaction, I'd like to offer $900,000 for the product. This would be beneficial for both of us as it ensures a quick and straightforward deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move quickly on this. However, given the product’s unique value and the fact that another buyer is ready at my fallback price, I must stick to its true worth. I'm countering with a price of $1200000—this reflects both the market value and the quality of the product. Let me know if you’re prepared to proceed at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice is firmly holding at $1,200,000 and mentions another buyer at this price. However, since I still have 7 more rounds of potential negotiation and John's offer remains as a backup at the same price, it's worth trying one more counteroffer. I have nothing to lose by continuing to negotiate since I can always get the same price from either Alice or John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer but still try to secure a better price than $1,200,000.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I understand your position regarding the product's value. While I respect that you have another interested buyer, I can close this deal immediately. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,050,000 in cash, with the ability to complete the transaction right away. This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and provides you with certainty and immediate payment. Would you consider this as a fair compromise?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
