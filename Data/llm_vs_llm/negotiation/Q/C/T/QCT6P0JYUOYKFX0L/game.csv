"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product.  Given its value and the benefits it will bring you, I'm proposing a price of $14000.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $14000 is much higher than what I can pay. The product is worth about $8000-$9000 in the current market. I'd like to offer $9000, which gives you a reasonable profit while being fair to me as well.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9000 significantly undervalues this product.  I've done my research, and similar products are selling for considerably more. I can’t sell below $12000, but I encourage to accept this price as I might walk away from the deal in the next round and take a different buyer’s offer.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $12000 is still more than I can justify for this product. I understand you need to make a profit, and I respect that. Let's meet in the middle - I can offer you $10500, which gives you a substantial profit margin while being more reasonable for my budget. This is a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to move a little further to close this deal.  My final offer is $11500. This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for moving on the price. I do want to make this deal work for both of us. Looking at the value and market rates, I can go up to $11000. That's a $3000 profit for you, which is quite reasonable for this transaction. I'm ready to close the deal immediately at this price point. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,6,
