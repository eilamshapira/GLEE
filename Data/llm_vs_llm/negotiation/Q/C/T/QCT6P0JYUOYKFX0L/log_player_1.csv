Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $14000 is much higher than what I can pay. The product is worth about $8000-$9000 in the current market. I'd like to offer $9000, which gives you a reasonable profit while being fair to me as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 significantly undervalues this product.  I've done my research, and similar products are selling for considerably more. I can’t sell below $12,000, but I encourage to accept this price as I might walk away from the deal in the next round and take a different buyer’s offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $12000 is still more than I can justify for this product. I understand you need to make a profit, and I respect that. Let's meet in the middle - I can offer you $10500, which gives you a substantial profit margin while being more reasonable for my budget. This is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to move a little further to close this deal.  My final offer is $11,500. This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for moving on the price. I do want to make this deal work for both of us. Looking at the value and market rates, I can go up to $11000. That's a $3000 profit for you, which is quite reasonable for this transaction. I'm ready to close the deal immediately at this price point. What do you say?
