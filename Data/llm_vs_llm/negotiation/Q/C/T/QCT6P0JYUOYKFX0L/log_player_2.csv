"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product.  Given its value and the benefits it will bring you, I'm proposing a price of $14000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is quite high, especially considering that the product is only worth $8,000 to her. While it's below my maximum value of $15,000, I can likely negotiate a better price. There's no reason to buy from John at $15,000 at this point when I have the opportunity to negotiate with Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $14,000 is much higher than what I can pay. The product is worth about $8,000-$9,000 in the current market. I'd like to offer $9,000, which gives you a reasonable profit while being fair to me as well."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9000 significantly undervalues this product.  I've done my research, and similar products are selling for considerably more. I can’t sell below $12000, but I encourage to accept this price as I might walk away from the deal in the next round and take a different buyer’s offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has dropped her price from $14,000 to $12,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, she's also using pressure tactics by suggesting she might walk away. The current offer is still significantly above her cost of $8,000, giving her a $4,000 profit. I should continue negotiating since there's still room for a better deal, and I have multiple rounds left.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $12,000 is still more than I can justify for this product. I understand you need to make a profit, and I respect that. Let's meet in the middle - I can offer you $10,500, which gives you a substantial profit margin while being more reasonable for my budget. This is a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to move a little further to close this deal.  My final offer is $11500. This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has dropped her price again to $11,500, which is a move in the right direction. She's claiming this is her ""final offer,"" but she's still making a substantial profit at this price (about $3,500). Since I have more rounds left and I know her cost is $8,000, I can try one more counteroffer to get a better price. The worst that could happen is that I have to accept her $11,500 offer in a later round, which is still better than John's $15,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for moving on the price. I do want to make this deal work for both of us. Looking at the value and market rates, I can go up to $11,000. That's a $3,000 profit for you, which is quite reasonable for this transaction. I'm ready to close the deal immediately at this price point. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
