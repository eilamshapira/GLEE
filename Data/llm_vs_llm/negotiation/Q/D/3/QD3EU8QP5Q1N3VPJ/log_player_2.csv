"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to acquire this unique product. Considering its value and potential for you, I'm offering it to you for the price of:  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Looking at the options:

1. Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000
2. I can buy the same product from John for $1,000,000
3. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and John's offer ($1,000,000) is $200,000 cheaper than Alice's offer ($1,200,000), the logical choice is to buy from John. Additionally, John's price exactly matches the maximum value of the product to me.
