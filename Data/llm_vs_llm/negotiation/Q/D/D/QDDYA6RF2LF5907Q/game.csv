"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $120 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  Let's see if we can make this work.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I'm getting closer to what I'm looking for, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. If you're really interested in the product, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",115.0,Alice,5,
