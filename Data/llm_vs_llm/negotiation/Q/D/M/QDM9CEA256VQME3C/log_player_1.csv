Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a fair offer price for Bob, considering the value of the product to both of us.

Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, and I know I can sell it to John for $150 if Bob declines, I should offer a price right at Bob's valuation.

If I offer Bob the product at $150, he should be indifferent between accepting and declining (since it's exactly what the product is worth to him). This maximizes my earnings while still making a viable offer.
