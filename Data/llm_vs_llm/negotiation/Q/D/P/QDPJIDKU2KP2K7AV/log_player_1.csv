I reject Bob's offer of $9,500 because it's still lower than my desired price. Although we're getting closer, I believe Bob is willing to pay more since the product is worth $15,000 to him. I'll proceed to the next round and make another counteroffer, trying to find a mutually beneficial price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you, Bob, for your revised offer. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.

I accept Bob's offer of $8,500. Although it's still a bit lower than I had hoped for, it's only $500 less than my previous counteroffer, and it's $500 more than the minimum I'm willing to accept from John. Considering the negotiation process and the fact that Bob has been willing to increase his offer, I believe $8,500 is a reasonable price to close the deal."
