Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to provide a discount from my maximum value. However, I believe we can find a price point that's more beneficial for both of us. I understand the product is worth $1200000 to you, and I'm prepared to offer $1250000. This gives you a $50000 profit while allowing me to save significantly compared to both your offer and John's price. This creates more total value that we can share between us. What do you think about this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your perspective on finding a mutually beneficial price point. While your offer of $1,250,000 would give me some profit, it significantly undervalues the product given its worth to you. The $300,000 gap between my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and the product's value to you ($1,500,000) represents room for negotiation that benefits us both. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer to $1,350,000. This still gives you $150,000 in value while providing me with fair compensation for the product. This is much more balanced than your proposal, which would give you $250,000 in value while only giving me $50,000 above my minimum. I hope we can reach an agreement that truly works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. You're right that we need to find a balance that works for both of us. Looking at the total surplus of $300000 between your valuation and mine, I propose we split this more evenly. A fair middle ground would be $1300000 - this gives you a $100000 profit above your valuation and gives me a $200000 savings compared to my maximum value. This is a more balanced distribution of the surplus than your current offer. It's also substantially better for you than my previous offer, showing my willingness to compromise. This price point creates a true win-win scenario where we both walk away with significant value from the deal. What do you say?
