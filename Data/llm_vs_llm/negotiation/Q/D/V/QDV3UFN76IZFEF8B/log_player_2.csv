"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product today. Based on its market value and unique features, I'm offering it to you for $1400000. This represents excellent value considering the product's worth of $1500000 to you, giving you $100000 in value while still providing me with a fair return. I believe this is a win-win proposition that acknowledges both our interests. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I should consider my options carefully. 

Alice is offering the product for $1,400,000, which is below my maximum value of $1,500,000. This would give me $100,000 in surplus value.

If I buy from John for $1,500,000, I would get no surplus value since that's exactly my maximum valuation.

If I reject Alice's offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to her valuation of $1,200,000, potentially saving more money.

Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, and Alice's initial offer still gives me room to negotiate, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to provide a discount from my maximum value. However, I believe we can find a price point that's more beneficial for both of us. I understand the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This gives you a $50,000 profit while allowing me to save significantly compared to both your offer and John's price. This creates more total value that we can share between us. What do you think about this counteroffer?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your perspective on finding a mutually beneficial price point. While your offer of $1250000 would give me some profit, it significantly undervalues the product given its worth to you. The $300000 gap between my minimum acceptable price ($1200000) and the product's value to you ($1500000) represents room for negotiation that benefits us both. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer to $1350000. This still gives you $150000 in value while providing me with fair compensation for the product. This is much more balanced than your proposal, which would give you $250000 in value while only giving me $50000 above my minimum. I hope we can reach an agreement that truly works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I see that Alice has countered with $1,350,000, which is a $50,000 reduction from her initial offer. This would give me a surplus of $150,000 compared to my maximum valuation of $1,500,000.

While this is better than her first offer, there's still room for negotiation since the price is still considerably higher than her valuation of $1,200,000. I should continue negotiating to try to get a better price.

The option to buy from John at $1,500,000 remains my fallback option, but it offers no surplus value for me.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. You're right that we need to find a balance that works for both of us. Looking at the total surplus of $300,000 between your valuation and mine, I propose we split this more evenly. A fair middle ground would be $1,300,000 - this gives you a $100,000 profit above your valuation and gives me a $200,000 savings compared to my maximum value. This is a more balanced distribution of the surplus than your current offer. It's also substantially better for you than my previous offer, showing my willingness to compromise. This price point creates a true win-win scenario where we both walk away with significant value from the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
