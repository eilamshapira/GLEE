"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. If you're interested, please consider my offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering the product for $200, which exceeds the maximum value of $80 that the product is worth to me. Meanwhile, John is offering the same product for $80, which matches exactly the maximum I'm willing to pay.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and Alice's offer ($200) is significantly higher than John's offer ($80), I should buy from John.
