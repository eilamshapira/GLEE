"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $6000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. However, I canâ€™t go as low as $6000. How about we settle on a price of $9000? I believe this is a fair value for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming back with a revised price of $9000. I appreciate the reduction, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $7000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",7000.0,Bob,4,

Hi Bob! Thank you for your counteroffer of $7000. I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible. How about we meet at $8500? I believe that's a great compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think!,8500.0,Alice,5,
