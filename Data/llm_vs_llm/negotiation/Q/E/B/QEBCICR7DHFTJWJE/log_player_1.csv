Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs and budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Since Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and even lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

My next offer will be:
