"Hello Bob, I have a product that is of high quality and would be valuable for you. I'm offering it to you for $250. This product is in excellent condition and offers great value. If you're interested, let me know.",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. While it sounds nice, $250 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $50?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $50 is significantly below the value of this item. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be fair about the product's worth. I can come down to $220. This is a quality product that I believe will serve you well.",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $220 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $75. I believe that's a fair price considering my budget.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but $75 is still too low for this product. The quality and value it provides justifies a higher price. I can reduce my offer to $190, which is a significant discount from my initial price. This is a product that's worth at least $150 to me, so I can't go much lower than this.",190.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It seems like we're getting closer. How about $100? That's the absolute highest I can go.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for continuing the negotiation. I understand that $100 is your highest offer, but I need to be transparent - I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $150 for this product. That's the minimum value I can accept. If you can meet me at $160, which is just slightly above my minimum threshold, I'd be happy to sell it to you instead. This is really the best I can do given the circumstances.",160.0,Alice,7,
