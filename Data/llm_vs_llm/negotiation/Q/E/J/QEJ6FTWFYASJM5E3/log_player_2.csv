Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for continuing the negotiation. I understand that $100 is your highest offer, but I need to be transparent - I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $150 for this product. That's the minimum value I can accept. If you can meet me at $160, which is just slightly above my minimum threshold, I'd be happy to sell it to you instead. This is really the best I can do given the circumstances. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160.

Alice is bluffing - she told us John would buy it for $150, and that $150 was her minimum. It's likely she doesn't have another buyer and is trying to push the price up. Since she's unwilling to meet my maximum price, I'll take the guaranteed deal with John."
