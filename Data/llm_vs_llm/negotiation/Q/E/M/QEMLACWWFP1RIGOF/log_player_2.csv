"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a high-quality product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm asking $150 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $120
2. Alice is offering the product for $150
3. John is offering the same product for $120

Since Alice's offer ($150) is higher than both:
- My maximum value ($120)
- John's alternative price ($120)

It wouldn't make sense to accept Alice's offer. Since John's price matches my maximum value and is lower than Alice's offer, I should buy from John.
