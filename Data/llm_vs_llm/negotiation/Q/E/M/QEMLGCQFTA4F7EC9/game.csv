"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I'm afraid $20000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and I can actually get it from another seller, John, for exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $6000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $6000. I understand that my initial offer was higher than you're comfortable with, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $6000 is still below my target price. Considering you mentioned the product's value to you is no more than $10000 and you can get it from John for that price, I'm willing to make a significant concession from my initial offer. I'll meet you halfway between my initial offer and your offer, which brings us to $13000. I believe this is a fair price, given the product's unique value and the fact that you prefer to do business with me.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on your price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be clear that $13000 is still more than what I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I can get this product from John for $10000, which is already the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. For me to choose you over John, I would need a better price. I can offer $8000, which would save me money compared to John's offer while still giving you a decent sale. This would be a win-win for both of us - I save compared to my alternative, and you make a sale today rather than continuing to search for another buyer.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $8000. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, as I've mentioned, I have a minimum value in mind for this product, and $8000 is still a bit short. Considering you're willing to pay $10000 to John, I'm starting to think that might be a more viable option for me as well. But, I'd still prefer to do business with you if we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $11000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value. If you're unable to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling to John for $10000, as it's becoming a more attractive option.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11000, which shows good faith in our negotiation. However, I need to be completely transparent here: I can purchase this exact product from John for $10000, which is already my absolute maximum budget. There's no incentive for me to pay $11000 when I have a $10000 alternative. In fact, if I'm going to pay $10000, I might as well go with John's offer right now. However, I'd still prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $9000, which is very close to what you mentioned John would pay. This gives you a guaranteed sale today rather than the uncertainty of finding another buyer. What do you say to closing this deal at $9000?",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9000. I understand your budget constraints and the alternative you have with John. However, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Given that you're willing to pay $10000 to John, I'm going to make a significant concession and offer the product to you for $10000. This is essentially matching the price you'd pay to John, but by buying directly from me, you'll be supporting our direct business relationship. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the fact that you prefer to do business with me. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as it seems to be the most straightforward option at this point.",10000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, thank you for matching John's price of $10000. I appreciate your willingness to come down to meet the market price. You've shown good faith throughout our negotiation by consistently reducing your price. Since we've built this rapport during our negotiation, and as I mentioned I'd prefer to do business with you, I'd like to make one final offer of $9500. This would give me a small savings compared to John's price while still being very close to your target. It would be a win-win: I save a little money, and you make the sale today without further negotiation. What do you say to finalizing our deal at $9500?",9500.0,Bob,8,
