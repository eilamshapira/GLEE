Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I'm afraid $2200000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me based on my market research and needs. To be fair, I'm willing to offer $650000 for the product. This is a serious offer that reflects the actual value I can derive from it. I hope we can find a middle ground, but I should mention that I do have an alternative option available at $800000 from another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is far below the market value.  This product offers significant long-term returns that your initial valuation might not capture. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a substantial adjustment, reflecting my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1900000 is still significantly above what makes economic sense for my business. While I understand you value the product highly, my analysis shows it would only generate $800000 in value for my specific needs. To meet you partway, I'm willing to increase my offer to $750000. This is very close to my absolute maximum budget constraint, and represents a fair compromise considering my alternative option is readily available at $800000. I'm hoping we can close this deal without me needing to pursue that alternative.

Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price, Alice. I can see you're making meaningful reductions with each round. However, I need to be transparent that $1600000 still exceeds what this product is worth to my business by a significant margin. My maximum valuation is $800000 - this isn't a negotiation tactic, but the actual ceiling of what the product will return for my specific use case. To demonstrate my commitment to working with you rather than my alternative supplier, I'm willing to offer $780000. This is nearly my absolute maximum, and I hope you can meet me at a price that works for both of us, as I'm literally at the edge of walking away to my alternative option.
