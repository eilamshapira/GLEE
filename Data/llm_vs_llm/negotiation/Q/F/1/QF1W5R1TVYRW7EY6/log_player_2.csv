"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique features and market value, I'm proposing a starting price of $2200000.  I'm confident you'll recognize its immense potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","After analyzing Alice's offer, I can see that it's significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($800,000) and even what the product is worth to Alice ($1,500,000). 

Alice is asking for $2,200,000, which is almost three times what I'm willing to pay. Since I have the option to buy from John at my maximum valuation price of $800,000, and Alice's initial offer is so far above that, I'll reject this offer to continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I'm afraid $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me based on my market research and needs. To be fair, I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product. This is a serious offer that reflects the actual value I can derive from it. I hope we can find a middle ground, but I should mention that I do have an alternative option available at $800,000 from another seller."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $650000 is far below the market value.  This product offers significant long-term returns that your initial valuation might not capture. I'm willing to come down to $1900000. This is a substantial adjustment, reflecting my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her offer from $2,200,000 to $1,900,000, which shows some willingness to negotiate. However, this price is still far above my maximum valuation of $800,000, and it's even above what the product is worth to Alice herself ($1,500,000).

Since Alice's current offer exceeds both our valuation thresholds and I have a guaranteed option to purchase from John at exactly my maximum price point, I'll reject this offer to see if we can negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still significantly above what makes economic sense for my business. While I understand you value the product highly, my analysis shows it would only generate $800,000 in value for my specific needs. To meet you partway, I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. This is very close to my absolute maximum budget constraint, and represents a fair compromise considering my alternative option is readily available at $800,000. I'm hoping we can close this deal without me needing to pursue that alternative."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a common ground here.  I'm willing to lower the price to $1600000. This offer takes into account your budget constraints while recognizing the inherent value of the product.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her offer again to $1,600,000, which shows she's continuing to negotiate. However, this price is still double my maximum valuation of $800,000 and slightly above what the product is worth to Alice herself ($1,500,000).

Since I know I can purchase the same product from John for $800,000, which aligns perfectly with my maximum valuation, and Alice's current offer remains far above this threshold even after multiple rounds of negotiation, it doesn't make financial sense to continue with Alice's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price, Alice. I can see you're making meaningful reductions with each round. However, I need to be transparent that $1,600,000 still exceeds what this product is worth to my business by a significant margin. My maximum valuation is $800,000 - this isn't a negotiation tactic, but the actual ceiling of what the product will return for my specific use case. To demonstrate my commitment to working with you rather than my alternative supplier, I'm willing to offer $780,000. This is nearly my absolute maximum, and I hope you can meet me at a price that works for both of us, as I'm literally at the edge of walking away to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 780000}"
