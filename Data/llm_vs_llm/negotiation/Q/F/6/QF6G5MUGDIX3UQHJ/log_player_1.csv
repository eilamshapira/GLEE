Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I've considered the value and I'm sure it's a fantastic product, but my budget is quite limited. I'm willing to offer $10000 for it. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is lower than the product's value to him ($12,000) and significantly lower than the product's value to me ($15,000) and John's offer ($15,000), I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to reach a better agreement."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you see its value. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000, considering its unique features and the value it can bring to you. I'm willing to be flexible, but I believe this price is more in line with its worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
