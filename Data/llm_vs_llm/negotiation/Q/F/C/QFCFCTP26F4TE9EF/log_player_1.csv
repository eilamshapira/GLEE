"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that Bob values the product at $100 and my minimum acceptable price is $150, it might be challenging to reach a deal. However, I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $150.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $150, there's no reason to accept this low offer or continue negotiating. Bob's initial rejection of my offer and subsequent very low counteroffer suggests he's not likely to reach my minimum price of $150.
