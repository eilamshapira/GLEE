"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $250 is way too expensive for me.  I'd be willing to pay $50 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. However, $50 is too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $200. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but $200 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $75? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and would be a fair deal for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your increased offer. I'm willing to come down some more, but $75 is still too low for me. Let's settle for $175. This way, we both give up some of our initial goals and reach an agreement. What do you say?",175.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but $175 is still too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",90.0,Bob,6,
