"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $250. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting price is way too high. It's important to signal that I'm looking for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $250 is way too expensive for me.  I'd be willing to pay $50 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 50} 

By starting with a very low counteroffer, I'm hoping to understand Alice's bottom line and leave room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. However, $50 is too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $200. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice barely budged on her price. I need to signal that I'm serious about a much lower price point.  I'll continue negotiating for now, but I'm keeping John's offer in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but $200 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $75? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 75}

I'm increasing my offer, but I'm still keeping it well below her price. I want to see if she's willing to negotiate within a range closer to my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your increased offer. I'm willing to come down some more, but $75 is still too low for me. Let's settle for $175. This way, we both give up some of our initial goals and reach an agreement. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is moving in the right direction but still too slowly.  I need to show her I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't get closer to my price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but $175 is still too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 90}

I'm making a smaller increase this time and stating this is my final offer. This signals I'm serious about my price limit and encourages her to make a decision."
