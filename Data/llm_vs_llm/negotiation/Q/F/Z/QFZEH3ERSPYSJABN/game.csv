"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm very interested in the product, I believe $1200000 is quite high. Given current market conditions, I would like to propose $800000 for the product. This is a substantial offer that reflects my serious interest in making a deal with you.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you think $1200000 is high, but I still believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. That being said, I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to propose a middle ground: $1000000. This price reflects the product's worth and takes into account your concerns about the market conditions.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground. Your product is certainly valuable, but I would feel more comfortable at $900000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer and would allow us both to walk away satisfied with the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price to $900000. I'm still convinced that the product's value is higher, but I'm getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with. Considering your latest offer, I'd like to propose a price of $950000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's worth.",950000.0,Alice,5,
