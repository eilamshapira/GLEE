"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm very interested in the product, I believe $1200000 is quite high. Given current market conditions, I would like to propose $800000 for the product. This is a substantial offer that reflects my serious interest in making a deal with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I want to try to get a better price for the product, so I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Since the product is worth no less than $800,000 to me, I'm willing to take the risk of negotiating further to see if I can get a higher price from Bob. Selling to John for $800,000 is a safe option, but I'd like to explore the possibility of getting more value from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you think $1,200,000 is high, but I still believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. That being said, I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to propose a middle ground: $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's worth and takes into account your concerns about the market conditions."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground. Your product is certainly valuable, but I would feel more comfortable at $900000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer and would allow us both to walk away satisfied with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'm getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with, but I still think I can get a better deal from Bob. Since he's willing to increase his offer to $900,000, it shows that he's interested in the product and willing to negotiate. I'll reject his offer and try to meet him somewhere in between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and his new offer of $900,000. Selling to John for $800,000 is still an option, but I'd like to see if I can get a higher price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price to $900,000. I'm still convinced that the product's value is higher, but I'm getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with. Considering your latest offer, I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
