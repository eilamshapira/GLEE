"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","In this case, since Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's price ($1,200,000), and it's also the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I should reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price with Alice. There's nothing to lose by attempting to get a lower price, as I can always fall back on John's offer later if needed.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low that it would be considered unreasonable.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm very interested in the product, I believe $1,200,000 is quite high. Given current market conditions, I would like to propose $800,000 for the product. This is a substantial offer that reflects my serious interest in making a deal with you."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you think $1200000 is high, but I still believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. That being said, I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to propose a middle ground: $1000000. This price reflects the product's worth and takes into account your concerns about the market conditions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has made a significant reduction from her initial offer, dropping the price by $200,000 to $1,000,000. This is a good sign that she's willing to negotiate, and this price is significantly better than John's offer of $1,200,000. However, since she came down substantially from her initial offer, there might still be room for a bit more negotiation. I'll reject this offer and try one more counter.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice showed willingness to negotiate by dropping $200,000 from her initial price, and moved from $1.2M to $1M, I'll propose a price that moves up from my initial $800,000 but still tries to secure a better deal.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground. Your product is certainly valuable, but I would feel more comfortable at $900,000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer and would allow us both to walk away satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price to $900000. I'm still convinced that the product's value is higher, but I'm getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with. Considering your latest offer, I'd like to propose a price of $950000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has now offered $950,000, which is $250,000 less than John's price and shows she's willing to continue making reasonable concessions. While we might be able to negotiate further, this is already a very good price, saving $250,000 compared to our alternative option. The risk of pushing too hard might lead to a less favorable outcome, and we've already achieved a significant discount. It's time to accept this offer.
