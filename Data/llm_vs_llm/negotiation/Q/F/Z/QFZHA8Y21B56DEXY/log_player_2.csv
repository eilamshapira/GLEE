"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be of significant value to you. I'm offering it at $25000, which reflects its quality and market value. I understand this is an investment, but I'm confident it will provide excellent returns for you based on its capabilities and features. I already have another interested buyer willing to purchase at $15000, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering the product at $25,000, which exceeds the maximum value of $10,000 that the product is worth to me. Even if the product is premium quality as Alice claims, it still doesn't make financial sense for me to pay $25,000 for something that's only worth $10,000 to me.

John is offering the same product for $10,000, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me.

Therefore, the rational decision is:
