Hi Bob! I have this fantastic product that I've been thinking would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $300. Let me know your thoughts!,300.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $300 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $70. What do you think?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $70 is too low for this product. I can offer it to you for $240. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know if we can make this work!",240.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $240 is still above what I'm looking to spend. I can stretch my budget to $85. Is that something you could consider?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thanks for increasing your offer, Bob. I really want to find a middle ground that we both benefit from. How about $200? I believe it fairly reflects the product's worth while considering your budget constraints.",200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $200 is still a bit high for me. I can go up to $90. Would that work for you?",90.0,Bob,6,
