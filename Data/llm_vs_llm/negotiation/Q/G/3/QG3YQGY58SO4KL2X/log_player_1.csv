Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I can get more than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.

{""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","I will reject Bob's offer of $6,000 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. Since John is willing to pay $8,000, which guarantees me my minimum price, I will take his offer rather than continue negotiating with Bob, who started with a low counteroffer.
