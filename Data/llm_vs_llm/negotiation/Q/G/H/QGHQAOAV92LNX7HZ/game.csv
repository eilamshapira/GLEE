"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product here that I think you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm offering it to you for $350. I'm confident it's worth every penny!",350.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $350 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $60 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $60 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but not that much. How about $325?",325.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $60 might be too low, but $325 is still outside my budget. Could you go down to $70? That's the highest I can go while still considering this a good deal.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate the increase, but $70 is still below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle a bit more. How about $300?",300.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're still far apart. I can stretch my budget a bit more, but I really can't go beyond $75. Is that something you can work with?",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but still not quite there. I'm willing to come down again. How about $275?",275.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. My final offer is $80. This is the absolute maximum I can afford for the product. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",80.0,Bob,8,
