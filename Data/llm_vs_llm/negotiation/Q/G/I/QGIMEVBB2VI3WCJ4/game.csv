"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. How does that sound?",800000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $800000 is below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to lower my initial offer to $1300000. This is still a great deal considering the value of the product. What do you think?",,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. However, $900000 is still below our minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000, which is the lowest I can go. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other offers. What do you think?",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. My final offer to you is $1200000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll need to consider other buyers. Let me know your decision.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand, Alice. Thank you for coming down further. I'm willing to raise my offer to $950000. This is pushing my budget, but I believe we're close to finding a compromise. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,6,
