"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000, considering I can also get it from John for $15000.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in the product, Bob. I appreciate your transparency about your budget. However, I must consider the product's value and the offer from John. I'm willing to compromise, but $12000 is a bit too low for me. I can offer it to you for $22000, which is still a competitive price considering its worth.",22000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $22000 is still above my budget. Considering John's offer of $15000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer $13500, which is a reasonable price given the circumstances.",13500.0,Bob,4,
