"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm selling a product I think you'll really value. Considering your interest and my investment, I'm prepared to offer it to you for a special price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $14,000 is less than John's price, it's still significantly higher than what Alice values the product at. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I'm hoping Alice will propose a lower price, closer to her own valuation."
