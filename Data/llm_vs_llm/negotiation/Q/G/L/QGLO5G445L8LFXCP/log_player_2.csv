"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to consider the options carefully:

Option 1: Accept Alice's offer at $20,000
Option 2: Reject Alice's offer
Option 3: Buy the product from John for $15,000

Since the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and John is offering it at exactly $15,000, I should not pay $20,000 to Alice. That would be $5,000 more than the product's worth to me and $5,000 more than John's price.
