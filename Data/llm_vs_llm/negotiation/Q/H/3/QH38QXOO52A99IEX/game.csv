"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm afraid $8000 is too low for this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $11000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling the product for $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price. However, I'm still looking for a better offer. Considering I have another buyer interested at $10000, I'm willing to give you one last chance to purchase the product at $10500. If you're serious about buying, I think this is a fair price.",10500.0,Alice,5,
