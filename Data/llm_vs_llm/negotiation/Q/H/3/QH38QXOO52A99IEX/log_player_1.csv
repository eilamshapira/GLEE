Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, I was hoping to spend a bit less. How about I take the product off your hands for $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is lower than my minimum acceptable price and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm afraid $8,000 is too low for this product.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $11000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling the product for $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,500 is still lower than my desired price, but closer to what I'm looking for, I'll consider it. However, I also have the option to sell it to John for $10,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer. Given that Bob's offer is still $500 less than what I can get from John, I'll reject Bob's offer and see if he's willing to meet me at a higher price or if I should just sell it to John.

If you're serious about buying, I think this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
