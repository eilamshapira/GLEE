"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $120
   - This is above my maximum value of $80
   - Would result in a loss of value for me

2. Reject Alice's offer
   - This allows me to pursue other options
   - No immediate cost

3. Buy from John at $80
   - This matches my maximum value
   - Best option available
   - Guarantees I get the product
   - Saves me $40 compared to Alice's offer

Since Alice's price ($120) is well above my maximum value ($80), and John is offering exactly my maximum value ($80), the rational choice is to buy from John.
