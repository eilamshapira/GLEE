"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice is offering the product at $12,000, which is the same price as John's offer. Since the product is worth at most $12,000 to me, I shouldn't pay full value if I can negotiate a better deal with Alice. Alice values the product at only $10,000, so there's room for negotiation.

I'll reject Alice's current offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to save some money.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but still gives me a good deal, considering Alice values the product at $10,000.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has come down from $12,000 to $11,500, which is a $500 savings compared to buying from John. While this is better, I think there's still room for negotiation since Alice values the product at $10,000.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.
