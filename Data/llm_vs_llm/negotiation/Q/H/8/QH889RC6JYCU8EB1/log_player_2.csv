"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100), I'll reject this offer. I can either make a counteroffer to Alice in the next round or ultimately buy from John if we can't reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 90}

I'll make a counteroffer of $90. This is below Alice's cost ($120), but it's a starting point for negotiation. If Alice rejects this, I expect her to counter with a lower price than her initial $150 offer. If we can't eventually reach a price below $100, I can always fall back on John's $100 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $130 because it's still higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). Since Alice has lowered her price from $150 to $130, it shows she's willing to negotiate. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, but if we can't reach a price below $100, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 95}

I'll increase my offer to $95, which is higher than my previous offer of $90 but still below my maximum value of $100. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and move toward a middle ground. While this is still below Alice's cost of $120, I'm hoping we can reach a mutually acceptable price. If Alice doesn't accept a price below $100, I always have John's $100 offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John for $100. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($125) is still well above my maximum value ($100)
2. Alice's offers have only come down slightly ($150 → $130 → $125)
3. Since the product is worth $120 to Alice, she's unlikely to go below that price
4. John's offer of $100 exactly matches my maximum value
5. Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a better price than John's offer

It's time to end the negotiation with Alice and take John's guaranteed offer of $100."
