"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the value of the product. However, $20000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $13000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $13000. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that my initial offer was a bit higher than your budget. However, I still believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $18000, which I think is a fair reflection of the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the product's value, $18000 is still a bit above what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $15000 for the product.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",15000.0,Bob,4,
