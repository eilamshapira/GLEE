Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the value of the product. However, $20000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $13000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $13,000 is lower than my initial offer and I believe the product is worth more. I'll try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. 

My counteroffer: $18,000. This price still reflects the product's value, but I'm showing willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $13,000. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that my initial offer was a bit higher than your budget. However, I still believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $18,000, which I think is a fair reflection of the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the product's value, $18000 is still a bit above what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $15000 for the product.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $15,000 matches the minimum price I'm willing to accept from John, and I've already negotiated with Bob, I'll accept Bob's offer. This way, I'm selling the product to someone who has shown interest and engagement in the negotiation process, and I'm getting a fair price for it."
