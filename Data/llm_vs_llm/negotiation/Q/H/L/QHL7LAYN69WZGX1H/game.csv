"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our product today. This high-quality item has been valued at $1000000 in the current market, and I know it would be a valuable asset for your business. While the full market value is $1000000, I can offer it to you for $950000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value you'll receive. I look forward to your response.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I'm hoping we can reach a more favorable agreement. I'd like to counter with an offer of $750000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us, considering the market and our respective valuations.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price, however, I cannot accept $750000 as this is below my minimum acceptable value for the product. The market value is $1000000, and I have another interested buyer willing to pay $800000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I can come down to $880000, which represents a significant discount from the full market value while still being fair to both of us. This price gives you substantial room for profit while allowing me to meet my requirements.",880000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. Given the information about your other offer and the market value, I'm willing to increase my offer to $800000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being within my budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $800000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, since I already have another buyer (John) willing to pay exactly $800000, I would need a better offer from you to make this deal worthwhile for me. Given that the product is worth $1000000 to you, I believe there's room for us to find a price that creates value for both of us. I can come down to $850000, which still gives you $150000 in value while providing me with a better return than my alternative option. This represents a fair split of the additional value created in our transaction. Does this work for you?",850000.0,Alice,5,
