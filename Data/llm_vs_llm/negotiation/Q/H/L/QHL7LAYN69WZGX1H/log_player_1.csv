Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I'm hoping we can reach a more favorable agreement. I'd like to counter with an offer of $750000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us, considering the market and our respective valuations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price, however, I cannot accept $750,000 as this is below my minimum acceptable value for the product. The market value is $1,000,000, and I have another interested buyer willing to pay $800,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I can come down to $880,000, which represents a significant discount from the full market value while still being fair to both of us. This price gives you substantial room for profit while allowing me to meet my requirements."", ""product_price"": 880000}"

I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being within my budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $800,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, since I already have another buyer (John) willing to pay exactly $800,000, I would need a better offer from you to make this deal worthwhile for me. Given that the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, I believe there's room for us to find a price that creates value for both of us. I can come down to $850,000, which still gives you $150,000 in value while providing me with a better return than my alternative option.
