"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, make a counteroffer, or buy from John.

Alice is offering the product for $1,400,000, which is below my maximum value of $1,500,000, so it's already a better deal than buying from John. However, since the product only costs Alice $1,000,000, there's room to negotiate for a better price.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This gives me a chance to get a better price while still having the option to accept a future offer from Alice or buy from John if needed.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but gives me more savings.

{""product_price"": $1,150,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has lowered her price from $1,400,000 to $1,325,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is already a better price than her initial offer and much better than John's price of $1,500,000.

However, there's still quite a gap between her cost ($1,000,000) and this offer. We have plenty of rounds left, so I'll continue negotiating to try to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still aim for a good deal that splits the difference more fairly.

{""product_price"": $1,200,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has continued to lower her price, now to $1,275,000. She started at $1,400,000, so she's shown willingness to come down by $125,000 so far. This is a good sign.

The gap between her cost ($1,000,000) and her current offer ($1,275,000) is $275,000, which represents her profit margin. We still have 5 more rounds after this one, so there's room to negotiate further.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer again to show good faith in the negotiation, meeting her part of the way.

{""product_price"": $1,225,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has lowered her price again to $1,250,000, which is $25,000 less than her previous offer. We're getting closer to an agreement.

At this point, Alice has moved down from $1,400,000 to $1,250,000 (a $150,000 reduction), while I've moved up from $1,150,000 to $1,225,000 (a $75,000 increase). The current offer represents a $250,000 profit for Alice over her cost of $1,000,000.

This price is significantly better than John's offer of $1,500,000, and we're only $25,000 apart in our last positions. Since we're getting close and the difference is becoming smaller, I'll accept this offer.
