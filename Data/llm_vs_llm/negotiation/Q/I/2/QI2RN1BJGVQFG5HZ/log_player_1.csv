Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a reasonably high price to leave room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $75 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and even well below John's guaranteed offer, I will reject this offer. However, rather than immediately selling to John, I'll try one more negotiation round with Bob since there might be room to reach a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial price but still maintain a price well above my minimum threshold of $150.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and John is offering a guaranteed $150, it would be more profitable to sell to John at this point. Bob's second offer, while higher than his first, is still significantly below John's offer, and the trend of Bob's increases suggests we're unlikely to reach a price above $150.
