"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a figure closer to $900000. I understand the value of the product, but I need to consider my budget constraints as well. Would you be open to negotiating at this price point?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900000 is far below the value I place on this asset. While I understand your budget considerations, I simply can't accept such a low price. However, I am willing to move from my initial offer. How about $1375000?",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for coming down a bit. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I was hoping for a more significant reduction. How about we meet in the middle at $1000000? This way, both of our interests are considered.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
