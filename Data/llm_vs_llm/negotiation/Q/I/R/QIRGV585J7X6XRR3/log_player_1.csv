Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I really appreciate the opportunity to negotiate, but my budget for this unique product is around $100. Would you be willing to sell it at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you have a budget in mind, but I'm afraid $100 is a bit too low for this unique product.
