"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. $10000 is lower than I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $15000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Meeting in the middle at $15000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a price of $12500. This is really my top limit, considering I have another option to buy the product for $12000 from someone else.",12500.0,Bob,4,
