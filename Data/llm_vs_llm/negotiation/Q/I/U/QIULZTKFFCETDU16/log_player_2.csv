"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is clearly above my maximum value of $10,000 and higher than John's price. It would be better to either negotiate for a lower price or buy from John if negotiations don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly below Alice's initial offer but leaves room for negotiation. Since I know I can get it for $10,000 from John, I'll start low.

{""product_price"": 7000}

This offer:
1. Is well below John's price of $10,000
2. Gives room for negotiation upward
3. Could save me significant money if accepted
4. If rejected, still allows for several rounds of negotiation before potentially going with John's offer"
