Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

My reasoning:

*   **Starting High:** I'm anchoring high. I don't know Bob's valuation, so I'm starting with a price that gives me significant profit potential.

*   **Room to Negotiate:** $12,000 is a premium price, leaving me room to come down in subsequent rounds if necessary. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and perceived value without immediately settling for less.

*   **Above My Minimum:** It's well above my $8,000 walk-away price, ensuring I'm not losing money on the deal.

I await Bob's response."
