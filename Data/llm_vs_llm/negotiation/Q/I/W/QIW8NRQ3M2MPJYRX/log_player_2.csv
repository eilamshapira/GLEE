"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $12,000
2. My maximum value for the product is $15,000
3. John's fixed price is $15,000
4. If I reject, I can make a counteroffer to try to get an even better price

Alice's offer of $12,000 is already $3,000 less than my maximum value and John's price. While I could try to negotiate for an even lower price by making a counteroffer, $12,000 is already a good deal as it represents a 20% savings compared to John's price.

Since it's a reasonable offer that's well below my maximum value, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation would yield a better result, I'll accept Alice's offer.
