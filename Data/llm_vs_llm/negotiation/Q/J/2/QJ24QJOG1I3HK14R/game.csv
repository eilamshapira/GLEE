"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I believe this is a fair price considering I can get a similar product from another seller for $100. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $70 is below what I can accept as the product is worth significantly more. I understand your point about other sellers, but this product is in excellent condition and offers great value. I can come down to $90, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the quality you're getting.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $90. I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current one. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",80.0,Bob,4,
