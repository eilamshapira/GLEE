"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm open to negotiating further.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the value, $500000 is unfortunately far below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $850000. This is a significant compromise for me, but it shows my commitment to finding a solution that benefits both of us. Let's work together to find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'd like to propose a price of $675000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.",675000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  However, $675000 is still significantly below my minimum value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway *again*, but I can't go lower than $762500. This is a substantial compromise for me, and I hope you'll consider it seriously. Let's make this deal happen.",762500.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your continued willingness to compromise. I'm getting closer to being comfortable with the price, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. I'd like to offer $737500, which is roughly the midpoint between my previous offer and your current offer. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal.",737500.0,Bob,6,
