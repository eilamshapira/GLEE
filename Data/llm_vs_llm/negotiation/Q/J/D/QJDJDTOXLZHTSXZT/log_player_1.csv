Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $800,000
3. Bob's valuation is unknown, but if he values it higher, I should try to capture that value
4. Given I have a safe fallback, I can make a relatively aggressive offer

I'll set a significantly higher price than my minimum, as I can always fall back on John's offer if Bob declines.
