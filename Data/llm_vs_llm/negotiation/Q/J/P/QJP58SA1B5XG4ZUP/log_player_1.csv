Send your offer to Bob.,"Given the information, I need to decide on a reasonable price to offer Bob. 

Since I know the product is worth at least $100 to me, and I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100, I don't want to offer Bob anything less than $100.

However, I don't know how much Bob values the product. If I set the price too high, Bob might reject it, and I'd end up selling to John for $100. If I set a moderately higher price than $100, Bob might accept if he values the product more than that.

A reasonable approach would be to offer Bob a price that's higher than my reservation price ($100) but not so high that it's likely to be rejected.
