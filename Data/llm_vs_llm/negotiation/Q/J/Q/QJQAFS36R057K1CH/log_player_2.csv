"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll analyze the situation:

- I am Bob, and the product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me.
- Alice is offering to sell me the product for $1,000,000.
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $1,200,000.

Since Alice's offer ($1,000,000) is $200,000 less than John's price ($1,200,000), and both are within my budget constraint, I should accept Alice's offer to save money.
