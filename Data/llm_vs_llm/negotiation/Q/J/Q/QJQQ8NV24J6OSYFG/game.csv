"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. Your asking price of $1200000 is significantly above what I can justify for this purchase. I have another seller willing to offer me the same product for $800000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer you $650000 for the product. This allows you to make a quick sale without the uncertainty of finding another buyer, and it helps me stay within my budget.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $650000. I understand that you have budget constraints, but I also have to consider the value of the product to me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Considering your offer and my initial price, I'd like to propose a counteroffer. I'm looking for a price that reflects the product's worth and also takes into account your interest in purchasing it from me directly.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. While $1000000 is better than your initial offer, I'm still not in a position to accept that price. As I mentioned, I have a solid offer from another seller at $800000, which is truly the upper limit of what this product is worth to me based on my budget and expected return on investment. I value the opportunity to work with you, so I'm willing to meet you at $720000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and gives you a quick, guaranteed sale. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to proceed immediately.",720000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $720000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. However, I still need to consider the product's value and my initial investment. Given that you've mentioned another seller is willing to sell the product to you for $800000, I'm surprised you're not willing to meet me at that price, considering you've expressed a preference to work with me. I'm willing to make a concession, but I need you to meet me halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $850000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and takes into account your budget constraints.",850000.0,Alice,5,
