Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. Your asking price of $1200000 is significantly above what I can justify for this purchase. I have another seller willing to offer me the same product for $800000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer you $650000 for the product. This allows you to make a quick sale without the uncertainty of finding another buyer, and it helps me stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $650,000 because it's lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to meet Bob in the middle and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. Since I have the option to sell to John for $800,000, I'll use that as a benchmark to guide my negotiations with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $650,000. I understand that you have budget constraints, but I also have to consider the value of the product to me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Considering your offer and my initial price, I'd like to propose a counteroffer. I'm looking for a price that reflects the product's worth and also takes into account your interest in purchasing it from me directly."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. While $1000000 is better than your initial offer, I'm still not in a position to accept that price. As I mentioned, I have a solid offer from another seller at $800000, which is truly the upper limit of what this product is worth to me based on my budget and expected return on investment. I value the opportunity to work with you, so I'm willing to meet you at $720000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and gives you a quick, guaranteed sale. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to proceed immediately. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $720,000. While it's an improvement from his previous offer, it's still below my target price. Since I have the option to sell to John for $800,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer, I'll continue to negotiate with Bob to see if he's willing to meet me closer to my desired price or at least match John's offer. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $720,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. However, I still need to consider the product's value and my initial investment. Given that you've mentioned another seller is willing to sell the product to you for $800,000, I'm surprised you're not willing to meet me at that price, considering you've expressed a preference to work with me. I'm willing to make a concession, but I need you to meet me halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $850,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and takes into account your budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
