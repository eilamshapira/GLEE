"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully. She's offering the product for $1,200,000, which exceeds the $800,000 maximum value the product has to me. John is willing to sell me the same product for $800,000, which is exactly at my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation and John's price, I should reject her offer and make a counteroffer. This gives me an opportunity to potentially get the product for less than $800,000, while still having John's offer as a fallback option.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. Your asking price of $1,200,000 is significantly above what I can justify for this purchase. I have another seller willing to offer me the same product for $800,000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer you $650,000 for the product. This allows you to make a quick sale without the uncertainty of finding another buyer, and it helps me stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $650000. I understand that you have budget constraints, but I also have to consider the value of the product to me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Considering your offer and my initial price, I'd like to propose a counteroffer. I'm looking for a price that reflects the product's worth and also takes into account your interest in purchasing it from me directly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her price from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, her current offer of $1,000,000 is still above my maximum valuation of $800,000 and higher than John's guaranteed price of $800,000.

Since I can buy the same product from John at exactly my maximum valuation, and Alice's current offer exceeds this price, the rational choice is to continue negotiating with Alice for a better price. If I can't reach an agreement with Alice below $800,000, I can always fall back on John's offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. While $1,000,000 is better than your initial offer, I'm still not in a position to accept that price. As I mentioned, I have a solid offer from another seller at $800,000, which is truly the upper limit of what this product is worth to me based on my budget and expected return on investment. I value the opportunity to work with you, so I'm willing to meet you at $720,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and gives you a quick, guaranteed sale. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to proceed immediately."", ""product_price"": 720000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $720000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. However, I still need to consider the product's value and my initial investment. Given that you've mentioned another seller is willing to sell the product to you for $800000, I'm surprised you're not willing to meet me at that price, considering you've expressed a preference to work with me. I'm willing to make a concession, but I need you to meet me halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $850000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and takes into account your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her price to $850,000, which is closer but still above both my maximum valuation and John's offer of $800,000. Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, paying $850,000 would result in a loss of value.

Given that Alice knows about John's offer of $800,000 and has still priced above that, I need to make a strategic decision. At this point, John's guaranteed offer of $800,000 (which is exactly at my maximum valuation) is more attractive than continuing to negotiate with Alice at prices above my valuation.
