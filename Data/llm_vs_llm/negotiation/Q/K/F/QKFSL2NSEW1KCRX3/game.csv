"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it's worth at least $20000, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I think $18000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to buy it for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $12000 is significantly lower than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price closer to $16000 would be more reflective of that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $16000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you believe the product is worth $16000, but I'm still not comfortable paying that much. Considering my initial offer and your revised price, I'm willing to meet you somewhere in the middle at $13500. I think this is a reasonable compromise.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13500 is closer to the mark, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Would you consider $14500?  It's a small adjustment, but it would help me feel comfortable with the deal.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I can see that we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to make a small adjustment to my previous offer, but I still can't quite meet you at $14500. How about we meet at $14000? I think this is a fair price considering our previous discussions.",14000.0,Bob,6,
