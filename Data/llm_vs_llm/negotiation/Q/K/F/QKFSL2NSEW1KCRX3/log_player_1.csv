Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I think $18000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to buy it for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Considering my initial offer and your revised price, I'm willing to meet you somewhere in the middle at $13500. I think this is a reasonable compromise.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I can see that we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to make a small adjustment to my previous offer, but I still can't quite meet you at $14500. How about we meet at $14000?
