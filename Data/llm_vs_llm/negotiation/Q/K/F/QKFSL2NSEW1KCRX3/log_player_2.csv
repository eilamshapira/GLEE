Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $12000 is significantly lower than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price closer to $16000 would be more reflective of that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $16000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13500 is closer to the mark, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Would you consider $14500?  It's a small adjustment, but it would help me feel comfortable with the deal.
