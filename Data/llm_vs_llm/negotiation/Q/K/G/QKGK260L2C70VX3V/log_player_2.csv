"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Looking at the offers:

1. Alice is offering the product for $12,000
2. John is also selling the same product for $12,000

Since the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and both Alice and John are offering the same price, there's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other. I'd be paying $12,000 either way.

Given that both offers are identical in price, I might as well accept Alice's offer since she's already engaged in discussion with me.
