"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $12000. I believe it's a fair price, but I'm open to negotiations.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand that the product is unique and rare, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $6000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's uniqueness and value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $10500, which is still a competitive price compared to similar products on the market.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your revised offer. I'd like to propose a price of $7750. This price takes into account the product's uniqueness and value, while also considering my budget constraints.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. Considering your budget constraints and the product's value, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $9250, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, given the product's uniqueness and market demand.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for another revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $9250 is still a bit above my budget. Considering your previous statement that $9250 is the lowest price you're comfortable with, I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'd like to propose a price of $8200. This price is closer to my budget limit, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the product's value and market demand.",8200.0,Bob,6,
