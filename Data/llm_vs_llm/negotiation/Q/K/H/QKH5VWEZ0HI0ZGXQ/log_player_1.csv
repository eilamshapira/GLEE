"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price, but I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand that the product is unique and rare, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and even lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I can try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's uniqueness and value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $10,500, which is still a competitive price compared to similar products on the market."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your revised offer. I'd like to propose a price of $7750. This price takes into account the product's uniqueness and value, while also considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Although Bob's offer of $7,750 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still lower than what John is willing to pay. I believe I can try to get a better price from Bob, so I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. Since Bob is willing to meet me halfway, I think there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. Considering your budget constraints and the product's value, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $9,250, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, given the product's uniqueness and market demand."", ""product_price"": 9250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for another revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $9250 is still a bit above my budget. Considering your previous statement that $9250 is the lowest price you're comfortable with, I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'd like to propose a price of $8200. This price is closer to my budget limit, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the product's value and market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $8,200 is higher than what John is willing to pay, and it's also a significant improvement from his previous offers. Considering that I've already made several compromises and Bob is willing to stretch his budget to meet me, I think $8,200 is a fair price for the product. I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
