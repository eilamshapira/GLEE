"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $150 is much higher than I'm willing to pay for this product. The product is only worth $80 to me, and I can actually buy it from another seller, John, for exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. Would you consider selling it for $60? This would allow you to make a quick sale, and I'd be happy to purchase from you rather than going to John.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be out of your budget, but I'm not comfortable selling the product for $60. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. How about we meet in the middle at $120? This way, you'll still be getting a good deal, and I'll be able to sell the product for a price that's closer to its value.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. However, $120 is still significantly more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I have the option to buy this identical product from John for $80, which is the absolute maximum value of this product to me. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $70. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to John, and I save a bit compared to my alternative option. Does that work for you?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $70 is still a bit too low for me. Considering your alternative option is to buy from John for $80, I'm willing to make a concession. How about we settle at $110? This way, you'll be getting a better deal than you would from John, and I'll be able to sell the product for a price that's more in line with its value.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I think there might be some confusion. John is offering me the product for $80, not higher than $110. So your current offer of $110 is not better than my alternative option. The maximum this product is worth to me is $80, which is exactly what John is charging. To make me choose to buy from you instead, I would need a price below $80. My offer is $75 - this would save me a bit compared to buying from John, and you'd still make a sale. This is really the highest I can go, as anything above $80 simply doesn't make economic sense for me.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective and the fact that John is offering the product for $80. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $75. As I've mentioned before, the product is worth at least $150 to me, and I'm trying to find a middle ground. Considering you're willing to pay up to $80, I'm willing to make a small concession. How about we meet at $100? This way, you'll still be saving $20 compared to buying from John at $120 is not an option for you, but $100 is lower than my previous offers, and it's a significant discount from the product's value to me.",100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I think there continues to be some confusion. John is offering the product for $80, not $120. Your current offer of $100 is still $20 more than John's price, so it doesn't make sense for me to accept it. The absolute maximum this product is worth to me is $80, which is why John's price is at my upper limit. For me to buy from you instead of John, you would need to offer a price below $80. I'm willing to pay $78 - this gives me a small savings compared to John's price, and allows you to make a sale. This is truly my final offer, as we've been negotiating for several rounds now, and I can simply purchase from John at any time for $80.",78.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $78. As I've mentioned before, the product is worth at least $150 to me, and I've been trying to find a middle ground. Considering you're willing to pay up to $80, I'm willing to make a small concession. How about we settle at $90? This way, you'll still be saving $10 compared to buying from John at $80 for a similar product, and I'll be able to sell the product for a price that's more in line with its value. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider selling to John for $150, which is a better deal for me.",90.0,Alice,9,
