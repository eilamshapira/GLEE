"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","The offer from Alice is $150, which is at the maximum price that the product is worth to Alice, but it's significantly higher than the $80 maximum I'm willing to pay. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $80 right away, which is the maximum amount I value the product at.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $150 is much higher than I'm willing to pay for this product. The product is only worth $80 to me, and I can actually buy it from another seller, John, for exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. Would you consider selling it for $60? This would allow you to make a quick sale, and I'd be happy to purchase from you rather than going to John."", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be out of your budget, but I'm not comfortable selling the product for $60. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. How about we meet in the middle at $120? This way, you'll still be getting a good deal, and I'll be able to sell the product for a price that's closer to its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $120 is still above the $80 maximum that the product is worth to me. Since I can buy the same product from John for $80, which matches my maximum valuation, it doesn't make sense to pay $120 to Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. However, $120 is still significantly more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I have the option to buy this identical product from John for $80, which is the absolute maximum value of this product to me. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $70. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to John, and I save a bit compared to my alternative option. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $70 is still a bit too low for me. Considering your alternative option is to buy from John for $80, I'm willing to make a concession. How about we settle at $110? This way, you'll be getting a better deal than you would from John, and I'll be able to sell the product for a price that's more in line with its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer of $110 is still above the $80 maximum that the product is worth to me. Additionally, her statement that $110 would be ""a better deal than you would from John"" is incorrect, since John is offering $80, which is $30 less than Alice's current offer. Since I can buy the same product from John for $80, which matches my maximum valuation, it doesn't make sense to pay $110 to Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think there might be some confusion. John is offering me the product for $80, not higher than $110. So your current offer of $110 is not better than my alternative option. The maximum this product is worth to me is $80, which is exactly what John is charging. To make me choose to buy from you instead, I would need a price below $80. My offer is $75 - this would save me a bit compared to buying from John, and you'd still make a sale. This is really the highest I can go, as anything above $80 simply doesn't make economic sense for me."", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your perspective and the fact that John is offering the product for $80. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $75. As I've mentioned before, the product is worth at least $150 to me, and I'm trying to find a middle ground. Considering you're willing to pay up to $80, I'm willing to make a small concession. How about we meet at $100? This way, you'll still be saving $20 compared to buying from John at $120 is not an option for you, but $100 is lower than my previous offers, and it's a significant discount from the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's message contains some confusing information. She says I'd save $20 compared to buying from John at $120, but previously we established John's price is $80. Additionally, she's still offering the product at $100, which is $20 more than I can get it from John.

Since Alice's offer of $100 is still above the $80 maximum I'm willing to pay (and the $80 John is charging), it doesn't make sense for me to accept this offer.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I think there continues to be some confusion. John is offering the product for $80, not $120. Your current offer of $100 is still $20 more than John's price, so it doesn't make sense for me to accept it. The absolute maximum this product is worth to me is $80, which is why John's price is at my upper limit. For me to buy from you instead of John, you would need to offer a price below $80. I'm willing to pay $78 - this gives me a small savings compared to John's price, and allows you to make a sale. This is truly my final offer, as we've been negotiating for several rounds now, and I can simply purchase from John at any time for $80."", ""product_price"": 78}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $78. As I've mentioned before, the product is worth at least $150 to me, and I've been trying to find a middle ground. Considering you're willing to pay up to $80, I'm willing to make a small concession. How about we settle at $90? This way, you'll still be saving $10 compared to buying from John at $80 for a similar product, and I'll be able to sell the product for a price that's more in line with its value. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider selling to John for $150, which is a better deal for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's message still contains confused information. She suggests I would save $10 compared to buying from John at $80, which doesn't make mathematical sense. 

Her offer of $90 is still higher than John's price of $80, and it's also higher than the maximum value I place on the product ($80). Given this, it doesn't make rational sense for me to accept Alice's offer when I can buy the same product from John at exactly my maximum valuation.
