"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider my options carefully. 

Alice is offering the product for $250, which is $100 more than what I value the product at ($150). This is not a good deal for me.

I have an alternative option to buy from John for $150, which matches my maximum valuation. This is my safety option.

However, I might be able to get a better deal from Alice through negotiation. I should reject Alice's initial offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice, starting well below my maximum price to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": $100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $225. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $225
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has lowered her price from $250 to $225, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $225 is still $75 more than my alternative option of buying from John for $150.

Since I can get the same product from John for $150, and Alice's current offer is still significantly higher than that, I should reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer slightly to show I'm negotiating in good faith, but I'll still keep it well below my maximum price of $150.

{""product_price"": $120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $190. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $190
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice is continuing to lower her price, now offering $190. This shows she's willing to negotiate further, but her price is still $40 higher than John's price of $150.

Since I can still get the exact same product from John for $150, and that's already my maximum valuation for this product, I should reject Alice's current offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer a bit more to show I'm negotiating in good faith, but I need to keep it below my alternative option.

{""product_price"": $135}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has dropped her price to $170, which shows she's continuing to negotiate, but this is still $20 more than John's price of $150.

Since I can get the same product from John for $150, and that already matches my maximum valuation, there's no reason for me to pay more than that. I should reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make one more increase to my offer, getting closer to my maximum price, while still leaving myself room to save money compared to John's price.

{""product_price"": $145}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's offer has come down to $160, which is getting closer but is still $10 more than John's price of $150. 

Since I can get the same product from John for $150, and that price already matches my maximum valuation, there's no reason for me to pay the extra $10 to Alice.

At this point, I should either make one final counteroffer or simply buy from John. Since we still have one more round, I'll reject and make a final counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since this is the final round, I'll make my final offer at $150, which matches John's price. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product, and if Alice doesn't accept, I'll simply buy from John.
