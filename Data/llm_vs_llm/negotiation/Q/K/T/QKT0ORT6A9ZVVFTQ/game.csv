"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $18000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $15000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $13000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,4,
