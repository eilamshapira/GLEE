"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is quite high for me, especially since I can get a similar product elsewhere. I value this product at around $10000, which I think is a fair price. Would you consider accepting this offer?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is significantly below what I need to get for this product.  How about we split the difference? I'll come down to $12500. This is a great deal for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
