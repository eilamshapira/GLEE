"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is quite high for me, especially since I can get a similar product elsewhere. I value this product at around $10000, which I think is a fair price. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below what I need to get for this product.  How about we split the difference? I'll come down to $12,500. This is a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
