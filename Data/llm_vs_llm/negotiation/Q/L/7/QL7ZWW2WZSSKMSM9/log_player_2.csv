"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer is the same price as John's offer ($15,000), and Alice suggests that the product is worth a lot to her, I should try to negotiate for a better price. There's no risk in making a counteroffer since I can always fall back on John's offer if needed.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a significantly lower offer to leave room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is quite high for me, especially since I can get a similar product elsewhere. I value this product at around $10,000, which I think is a fair price. Would you consider accepting this offer?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is significantly below what I need to get for this product.  How about we split the difference? I'll come down to $12500. This is a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing her price by $2,500, which is a significant drop. This price ($12,500) is already $2,500 better than John's offer ($15,000). While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might become less flexible or withdraw, and I'd have to fall back to John's higher price. This seems like a good deal that saves me $2,500.
