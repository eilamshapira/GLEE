Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1,900,000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Anchor:** Starting with a significantly higher price than your minimum ($1,200,000) can help establish a strong anchor point in Bob's mind.  This might make him perceive subsequent offers as more reasonable, even if they are still above your minimum.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer is primarily to gauge Bob's interest and potential valuation of the product.  His response (acceptance, rejection, or counter-offer) will give you valuable information for the next stage of negotiation.
* **Downside Protection:** Even if Bob rejects this initial high price, you have the security of selling to John for $1,200,000."
