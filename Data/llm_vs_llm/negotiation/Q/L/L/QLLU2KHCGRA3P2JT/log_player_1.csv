Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm confident the product is worth more to him than to John, but I'll be prepared to walk away and take John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit to $1,250,000.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product has value above John's offer.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 
 
I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's less than what I initially hoped for, it's still a good deal, and it avoids the risk of losing the sale to John.  I'm also confident that we can build a good relationship with Bob for future potential transactions."
