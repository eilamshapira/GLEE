"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, reject it and make a counteroffer, or simply buy from John.

Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000, which is exactly the maximum I'm willing to pay (my reservation value) and exactly the same as John's price.

Since Alice's current offer doesn't save me any money compared to buying from John, and I have the opportunity to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower to leave room for negotiation while still being reasonable.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has now offered $1,250,000, which is $250,000 less than my maximum willingness to pay and John's price. This is a substantial savings, but I might be able to negotiate an even better deal.

Since Alice has already come down from $1,500,000 to $1,250,000, there's a good chance I can get her to reduce the price further. The worst case is that I can always go back to this offer or buy from John at $1,500,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that moves closer to Alice's offer but still tries to get a better price:
