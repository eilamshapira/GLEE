"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. After careful consideration of its market value and exceptional qualities, I'm offering it to you for $2300000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential value. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your alternative option of buying from John for $1,500,000. There's no reason to accept such a high price. By rejecting the offer, you can try to negotiate a better deal with Alice or simply proceed with purchasing from John."
