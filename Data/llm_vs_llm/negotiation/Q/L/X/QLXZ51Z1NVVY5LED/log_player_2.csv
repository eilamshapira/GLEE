"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’d like to offer you my premium product at $2500000. Given its exceptional features and value, I believe this price accurately reflects its quality. I’m open to discussing further if needed, but please note that I also have a guaranteed offer from another buyer at $1200000. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. Alice's offer of $2,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $800,000, which matches my maximum value
4. Alice mentions having another buyer at $1,200,000, suggesting she's unlikely to go below that price

The logical decision is to buy from John, as Alice's price is far too high and even with negotiations, it's unlikely she'll go below both her alternative offer ($1,200,000) and my maximum value ($800,000).
