Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic decision here. Since the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed backup buyer (John) at exactly that price, I should offer Bob a price that's higher than my minimum acceptable value.

If I price it too high, Bob might reject it, but that's fine since I have John as a backup. If I price it slightly above my minimum, I increase my chances of Bob accepting while still ensuring I make more than my minimum.

I'll offer Bob a price of $18,500, which is a reasonable markup but not so high that it's likely to immediately turn him away.
