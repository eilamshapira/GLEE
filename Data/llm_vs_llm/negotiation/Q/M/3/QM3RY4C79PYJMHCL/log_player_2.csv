Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 600000}

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 650000}

Round 6

While Alice is finally moving more substantially, this is still too high. We're getting close to the point where John's offer is looking more and more appealing."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 750000}

This is our final offer. It's a significant increase from our previous offers and shows Alice we're willing to be flexible, but we're also running out of room to negotiate."
