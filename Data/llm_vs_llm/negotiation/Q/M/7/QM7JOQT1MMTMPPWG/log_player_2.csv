"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer ($140) is higher than both my maximum valuation ($100) and John's price ($100), it would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. The best decision would be to buy from John at $100.
