"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. Iâ€™m offering you this product at $1500000. Please let me know if you wish to proceed, as I have another buyer ready at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $1,500,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,200,000.
