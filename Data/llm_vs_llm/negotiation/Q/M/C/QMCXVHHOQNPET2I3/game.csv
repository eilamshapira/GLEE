"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $250 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $100.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and lower the price, but I need to get closer to the product's value. Let me make you a new offer.",220.0,Alice,3,
