"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, I'm ready to make my first offer to Bob. I want to get as much as I can, but I also don't want to scare him off right away. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","This is a tough spot! Bob's offer is below my minimum value. I have to make a decision now.

Here's what I'm thinking:

*   **Accepting Bob's offer ($70):** This is a loss. I make less than my minimum value.
*   **Rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering:** This is risky. Bob might walk away, and I could end up with nothing or even less. It might also signal to Bob that I'm desperate to sell, which could lead to an even lower counter-offer.
*   **Selling to John ($80):** This guarantees I make at least my minimum profit, which is better than the $70 Bob is offering.

Considering the risk, I think it's best to cut my losses and take the sure thing.
