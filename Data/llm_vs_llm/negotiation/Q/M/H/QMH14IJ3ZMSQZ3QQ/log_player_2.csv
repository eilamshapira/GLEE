"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $25000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me. Alice is offering it for $25,000. That's far too high. I'd rather buy it from John for $8,000.
