"Hi Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this exclusive product. Based on its value and rarity, I'm offering it to you for $25000.",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, $25000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and I can actually purchase it from another seller, John, for exactly $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you be willing to offer the product for $8000? This would save me some money compared to my alternative and allow us to close the deal quickly.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $8000, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about $22000?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $22000 is still substantially above what makes financial sense for me. As I mentioned, the product is only worth $10000 to me, and I have another seller offering it at exactly that price. To make it worth switching to you as my supplier, I need a better deal. I can offer $8500. This gives you a quick sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have other options, but I believe the quality of my product is superior. Given its value, I'm willing to lower the price to $20000. This is my final offer, and it's a significant reduction from my initial asking price. Take it or leave it.",20000.0,Alice,5,
