"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this exclusive product. Based on its value and rarity, I'm offering it to you for $25,000."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, $25000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and I can actually purchase it from another seller, John, for exactly $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you be willing to offer the product for $8000? This would save me some money compared to my alternative and allow us to close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Okay, Bob's offer is too low. I know the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, and I'm aiming for a higher profit. I'm not going to accept $8,000. I'm also not going to sell to John just yet. I still have 8 rounds left.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $8,000, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about $22,000?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $22000 is still substantially above what makes financial sense for me. As I mentioned, the product is only worth $10000 to me, and I have another seller offering it at exactly that price. To make it worth switching to you as my supplier, I need a better deal. I can offer $8500. This gives you a quick sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is still too low. He's trying to pressure me with the other seller, but I'm not budging. I still have time and I know my product is worth at least $10,000 to me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have other options, but I believe the quality of my product is superior. Given its value, I'm willing to lower the price to $20,000. This is my final offer, and it's a significant reduction from my initial asking price. Take it or leave it."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
