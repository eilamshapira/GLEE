"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this exclusive product. Based on its value and rarity, I'm offering it to you for $25000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that Alice is offering the product for $25,000, which is much higher than the $10,000 maximum value to me, and also higher than John's price of $10,000, it makes financial sense to reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, $25,000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and I can actually purchase it from another seller, John, for exactly $10,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you be willing to offer the product for $8,000? This would save me some money compared to my alternative and allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $8000, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about $22000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $22,000 is still significantly above the $10,000 maximum value to me, and still higher than John's price. Since I have the alternative to buy from John for $10,000, there's no reason to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $22,000 is still substantially above what makes financial sense for me. As I mentioned, the product is only worth $10,000 to me, and I have another seller offering it at exactly that price. To make it worth switching to you as my supplier, I need a better deal. I can offer $8,500. This gives you a quick sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have other options, but I believe the quality of my product is superior. Given its value, I'm willing to lower the price to $20000. This is my final offer, and it's a significant reduction from my initial asking price. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's offer of $20,000 is still twice the maximum value of $10,000 that the product is worth to me, and twice what John is offering. Even if Alice claims her product is superior, it doesn't justify paying double when the maximum value to me remains $10,000. At this point, it makes more sense to purchase from John.
