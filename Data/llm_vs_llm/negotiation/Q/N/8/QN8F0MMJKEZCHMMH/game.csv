"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is quite steep for me, especially since I can get the same product elsewhere at that price. I'd be interested in purchasing it for $10000. This would be a win-win situation as you'd get a guaranteed sale, and I'd get a better deal. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price. However, the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $13500, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
