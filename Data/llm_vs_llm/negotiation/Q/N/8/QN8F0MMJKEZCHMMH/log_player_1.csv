"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is quite steep for me, especially since I can get the same product elsewhere at that price. I'd be interested in purchasing it for $10000. This would be a win-win situation as you'd get a guaranteed sale, and I'd get a better deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price. However, the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
