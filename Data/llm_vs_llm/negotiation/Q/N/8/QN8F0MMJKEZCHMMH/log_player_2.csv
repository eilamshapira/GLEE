"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice is offering the product at $15,000, which is exactly the same price as John's offer, and this is also the maximum amount the product is worth to me, there's no advantage in continuing the negotiation. Neither accepting Alice's offer nor making a counteroffer would lead to any savings.

In this case, any of the options (accepting Alice's offer or buying from John) would result in the same outcome. However, since we know John's price is firm at $15,000, we might as well try to negotiate with Alice for a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a significantly lower counteroffer to create room for negotiation, but still keep it reasonable to show I'm serious about buying.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is quite steep for me, especially since I can get the same product elsewhere at that price. I'd be interested in purchasing it for $10,000. This would be a win-win situation as you'd get a guaranteed sale, and I'd get a better deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price. However, the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $13500, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced the price by $1,500, which is a significant improvement from the initial offer and is $1,500 less than John's price. This is a good price considering the product is worth up to $15,000 to me. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might become less flexible or withdraw this offer. Since we're already getting a decent discount compared to John's price, it would be wise to accept this offer.
