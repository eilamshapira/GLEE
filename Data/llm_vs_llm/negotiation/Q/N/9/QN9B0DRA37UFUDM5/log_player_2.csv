"Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $250 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $120. It would be unwise to accept this offer when I know I can get it from John for $120. I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 80}

I'll offer $80, which is significantly below John's price of $120. This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's price. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate upward, and I always have John's $120 offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $220. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $220
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $220 is still well above John's price of $120. Since I can get the product from John for $120, there's no reason to accept a price higher than that. I'll reject and try another counteroffer to see if Alice will come down to a more competitive price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 95}

I'll increase my offer to $95, which is still below John's price of $120. This shows Alice I'm willing to move up from my initial offer of $80, but I'm still aiming to get a better deal than John's price. If Alice doesn't accept this, I still have the option to go with John's offer of $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offers are consistently remaining well above John's price of $120, and while she is coming down in price, she's still far from matching or beating John's offer. Since I know I can get the product for $120 from John, and Alice seems unwilling to offer a competitive price after several rounds of negotiation, it's best to end the negotiation and purchase from John."
