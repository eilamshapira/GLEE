"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm thrilled you're interested in acquiring this exceptional product. It's a truly unique opportunity. To begin, I'm offering it to you for $2500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer against my maximum value and Jhon's alternative.

Alice is offering the product for $2,500,000, which is significantly above the $1,200,000 maximum value the product has to me. This would lead to a net loss if I accepted.

Jhon is offering the same product for $1,200,000, which is exactly at my maximum value, so I would break even.

I could reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, but since I already have a guaranteed option at my maximum value, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice unless I can get the product for less than $1,200,000.
