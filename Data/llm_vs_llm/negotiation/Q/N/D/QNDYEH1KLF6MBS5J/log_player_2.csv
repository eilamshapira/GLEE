"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my exclusive product at a price of $1200000. Let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first.  Her initial offer is much higher than my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I had in mind. Would you consider $650,000 for the product?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. My product is of exceptional value, and while I understand your budget constraints, Iâ€™m willing to reduce my initial ask. How would you feel about purchasing it for $900000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is coming down, $900,000 is still too high. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $800,000 is the highest I can go.  It's a fair offer considering I have other options available. "",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

I'm putting my upper limit out there. This will let Alice know I'm serious but also have a firm budget."
