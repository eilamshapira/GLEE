"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $12,000
2. Alice's offer is $10,000, which is below my maximum
3. John's fixed price is $12,000
4. Alice's cost is $8,000, so there's room for negotiation

Since $10,000 is $2,000 less than my maximum value and John's price, I could accept this offer. However, knowing that Alice's cost is $8,000, there might be room to negotiate for a better price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's cost is $8,000 and she offered $10,000, I'll try to meet somewhere in the middle. I'll offer $9,000, which would still give Alice a $1,000 profit while saving me more money. This is a reasonable counteroffer that leaves room for further negotiation if needed.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has moved down from her initial $10,000 to $9,500
2. This represents a good faith negotiation, moving halfway between her previous offer and my counteroffer
3. $9,500 is still well below my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price
4. While there might be room for further negotiation, the incremental savings might not be worth the risk of prolonging negotiations

Given that Alice has shown willingness to negotiate and has offered a fair compromise at $9,500 (which saves me $2,500 compared to John's price), I'll accept this offer.
