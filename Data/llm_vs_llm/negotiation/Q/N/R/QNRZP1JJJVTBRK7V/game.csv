"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I believe the product has potential, $20000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in exploring a mutually beneficial deal. Would you consider a price closer to $5000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but $5000 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and find a middle ground. I believe the product's value lies somewhere in between.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $15000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. To be frank, $8000 is my upper limit, and I can get the product elsewhere at that price. Would you be willing to come down to $7000? It would be a win-win for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget and the alternative options you have. However, I still believe my product has a higher value than $7000. Considering your upper limit is $8000, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and your upper limit.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement, but $12000 is still a significant stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers at $9500.  This demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging the value of your product.",9500.0,Bob,6,
