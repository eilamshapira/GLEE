"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I believe the product has potential, $20000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in exploring a mutually beneficial deal. Would you consider a price closer to $5000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $5,000 because it's significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a more reasonable offer. I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but $5,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and find a middle ground. I believe the product's value lies somewhere in between."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $15000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. To be frank, $8000 is my upper limit, and I can get the product elsewhere at that price. Would you be willing to come down to $7000? It would be a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $7,000 because it's still below my minimum acceptable price. Although Bob mentions he can get the product elsewhere for $8,000, I'm not convinced that's a better option for me, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $12,000. I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer, trying to meet Bob halfway between my previous offer and his upper limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget and the alternative options you have. However, I still believe my product has a higher value than $7,000. Considering your upper limit is $8,000, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and your upper limit."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the movement, but $12000 is still a significant stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers at $9500.  This demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging the value of your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

I decide to sell the product to John for $12,000. Although Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's still lower than what John is willing to pay. Since I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, which is above my minimum acceptable price, I choose to end the negotiation with Bob and sell to John to ensure I get the best deal."
