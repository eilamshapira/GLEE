"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a price of $135. I believe it has great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $135 is above both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). It would be better to either negotiate with Alice for a lower price or buy from John. Since there's an opportunity to negotiate, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $135 is quite high for me, especially since I can find similar products elsewhere for much less. I value this product at $80 - would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
