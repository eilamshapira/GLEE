"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire my extraordinary product. It's truly a one-of-a-kind asset with immense potential. Given its exceptional qualities and the value it holds, I'm initially offering it to you for $3000000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it can bring to you.",3000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering me as a potential buyer for your product. I appreciate the value you've placed on it, but I have to admit that $3000000 is above my budget. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900000, which I believe is a fair price given the product's potential and my financial constraints.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're working within a budget, but $900000 is significantly below the product's inherent value and my minimum acceptable price. While I appreciate your interest, I can't go that low. However, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. How about $2700000?",2700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price from $3000000 to $2700000. However, it's still above what I'm comfortable paying. Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $1050000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate you increasing your offer. However, $1050000 is still quite a bit lower than what I can accept. I'm getting closer to my bottom line, and to show you I'm serious about making a deal, I'll offer it to you for $2400000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I hope you'll see the value in it.",2400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate the effort you're putting into finding a mutually agreeable price. However, $2400000 is still beyond my budget. I've been considering our previous exchanges, and I'm willing to make one more adjustment to my offer. I'll increase it to $1150000, which is the highest I'm comfortable going. If this isn't acceptable, I may need to explore other options.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
