"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's initial offer is $150, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I don't see any benefit in accepting the offer immediately or buying from John for the same price. I'd like to try to negotiate a better price with Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial offer, to see if we can negotiate a better price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I still believe it's worth more than $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's counteroffer of $135 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Since she's already come down from $150 to $135, I'm hoping she might be willing to negotiate further.

I'll try to split the difference again and see if we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll send a new counteroffer: 

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer! I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $127.50. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 127.50}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.
