"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10000 to you, and it's a fair price for me, given its value. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $7000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. ",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $7000.  How about we try $7500? That's a significant move on my part.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $7500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $8250.  I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough!  I'm trying to make a fair deal here. Let's do $7800, and I think we can close this out.",7800.0,Bob,6,
