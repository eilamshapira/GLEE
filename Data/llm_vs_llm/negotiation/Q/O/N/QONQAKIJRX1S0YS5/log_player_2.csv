"Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Reasoning: The offer of $17,000 from Alice is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's alternative offer ($10,000). Accepting Alice's offer would mean losing $7,000 compared to buying from John. Even if I make a counteroffer, since the product is worth $15,000 to Alice, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal below $10,000. Therefore, the best decision is to buy from John for $10,000."
