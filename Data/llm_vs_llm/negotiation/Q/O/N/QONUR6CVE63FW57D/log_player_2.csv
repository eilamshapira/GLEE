Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and within my budget. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a lower price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $100. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 100}"

Round 3

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer, trying to meet Alice halfway between her previous offer and my target price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for coming down to $125. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still a bit short of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $110? I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your ongoing interest and effort to meet halfway. Given our previous discussions and the value of this product, I can adjust my offer to $115. Let me know if $115 works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $115 is very close to my maximum budget of $120, and it's only $5 away from John's price of $120. Considering the negotiations so far, I think $115 is a reasonable price. I'll accept Alice's offer to avoid further negotiation and potential risks of not getting the product at a better price.
