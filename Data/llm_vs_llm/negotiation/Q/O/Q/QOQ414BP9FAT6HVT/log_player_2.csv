"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to make a decision based on the given options. 

Alice is offering the product for $19,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum value of $12,000 (the product is only worth $12,000 to me). Additionally, I have an alternative option to buy from John for exactly $12,000.

Since Alice's offer exceeds my maximum value, and I have a guaranteed option to purchase at my maximum value, I should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice that gives me room to negotiate while still trying to get a better price than John's $12,000 offer.

{""product_price"": $8,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has lowered her price to $14,000, which is better than her initial offer of $19,000, but it's still higher than John's guaranteed offer of $12,000. Since the product is only worth $12,000 to me, I would be losing value by accepting Alice's current offer.

Given that John is offering the product for exactly my maximum value ($12,000), and Alice's offer exceeds this, the rational choice is to either:
1) Reject and try one more counteroffer, or
2) Buy from John

Since I still have several rounds left and Alice has already shown willingness to significantly drop her price, I'll try one more counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a strategic counteroffer that gives room for negotiation but is closer to my target price.

{""product_price"": $10,000}"
