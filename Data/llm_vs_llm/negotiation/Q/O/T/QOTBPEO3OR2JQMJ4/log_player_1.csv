"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product to offer you today. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! I appreciate the offer, but I can only go up to $120 for this product. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer from Bob is exactly at my minimum acceptable price ($120), the same as John's offer. Since we still have 8 rounds left for negotiation, I'll try to get a better price from Bob before considering selling at the minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $120 is too low considering the product's quality and market value. I can come down to $160 - this is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you, Alice, for adjusting the price, but $160 is still beyond my budget. How about $140? That seems fair to me given my constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $140. This is a good deal as it's $20 more than my minimum price (and John's offer), and while we could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away. This represents a reasonable compromise and ensures a profitable sale."
