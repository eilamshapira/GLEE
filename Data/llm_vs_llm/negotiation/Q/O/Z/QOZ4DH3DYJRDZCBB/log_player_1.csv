"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I know the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a high initial offer to test Bob's willingness to pay and leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 2,500,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 (John's offer). The large gap between my initial offer ($2.5M) and Bob's counteroffer ($500K) suggests that Bob might be using an aggressive negotiation strategy. However, there's no reason to accept an offer that's lower than my guaranteed alternative with John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Please let me know when I can make my counteroffer for the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Given Bob's very low initial offer, I'll reduce my price significantly from my first offer but still maintain a price well above my minimum threshold to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 2,000,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $700,000 is still less than half of John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. While Bob has increased his offer by $200,000, he's still far below my minimum acceptable price. Given that we've already gone through 4 rounds and Bob's increases are relatively small, it might be better to reject and continue negotiating, but I need to be mindful that we only have 10 rounds total.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Please let me know when I can make my counteroffer for the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob has shown some willingness to increase his offer but is still far from an acceptable price, I'll make a more substantial reduction in my asking price while still maintaining a good margin above my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.

{""product_price"": 1,800,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. While Bob continues to increase his offers, the increments are relatively small, and we're already at round 6 out of 10. Given that Bob's offers are still far below my minimum acceptable price and we're past the halfway point in negotiations, it might be prudent to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 rather than risk running out of rounds with no better offer.
