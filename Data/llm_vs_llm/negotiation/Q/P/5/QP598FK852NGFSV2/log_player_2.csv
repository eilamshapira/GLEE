"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth no more than $100 to me, so I won't accept Alice's offer of $150 since it exceeds my maximum value. While I could buy from John immediately for $100, it makes sense to first try negotiating with Alice to potentially get a better price. Therefore, I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 75}

I'll offer $75 to Alice. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $100
2. It leaves room for negotiation to move up if needed
3. It might still be profitable for Alice (depending on her costs)
4. If Alice rejects this, I still have the option to buy from John at $100"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $140 because:
1. It's still well above my maximum value of $100
2. Alice has reduced her price from $150 to $140, showing she's willing to negotiate
3. I still have John's guaranteed offer of $100 as a backup
4. I can make another counteroffer to try to get a better price from Alice
5. Since Alice moved down $10, it suggests there might be room for further negotiation"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 85}

I'll increase my offer to $85 because:
1. Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by lowering her price
2. Moving up from my previous offer of $75 shows I'm also willing to be flexible
3. $85 is still well below my maximum value of $100, leaving me with consumer surplus
4. It's a significant enough increase from my last offer to show good faith in negotiation
5. I still have the option to buy from John at $100 if Alice rejects this offer"
