"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and John is willing to sell it for $100, there's no way I would accept an offer of $180. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If we can't reach a reasonable price lower than $100, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

I'll make a counteroffer of $70. This is significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer of $180 and John's fixed price of $100. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing me to save money compared to buying from John. If Alice rejects this, we can try to find a middle ground, but I'll always have the option to go to John if the price doesn't get below $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $160 is still well above both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). While Alice did reduce the price from $180 to $160, showing some willingness to negotiate, this price is still not acceptable. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round. If Alice doesn't come down to a price below $100, I can still go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 80}

I'll increase my offer slightly to $80. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and move up from my initial offer of $70, but still maintains a good bargaining position. This price would give me significant savings compared to John's $100 price, while also showing some flexibility to Alice. If Alice doesn't come down to a reasonable price below $100 in the next rounds, I still have the option to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's offers have only come down slowly ($180 -> $160 -> $150)
2. The gap between our positions is still very large (my $80 vs her $150)
3. Even after multiple rounds, Alice hasn't offered a price below $100
4. We've used half of our available rounds and aren't close to agreement
5. John's price of $100 is guaranteed and matches my maximum value

Rather than continue negotiating with Alice when she seems unlikely to drop below $100, it's more practical to take John's known offer of $100. This ensures I get the product at my maximum acceptable price without risking further rounds of unsuccessful negotiation."
