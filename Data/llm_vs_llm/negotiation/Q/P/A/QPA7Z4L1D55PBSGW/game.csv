"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product I'd like to offer you today. Based on my assessment of its value and market conditions, I'm offering it to you for $180. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and durability. Are you interested in purchasing at this price?",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $100, I'm afraid I can't go that low as the product costs me at least $120. However, I'm willing to work with you on the price. I can offer it to you for $150, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is a high-quality product that provides excellent value at this price point. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $150 is still above what I'm willing to spend. Given that you mentioned the product costs you $120, how about we settle at $110? This way, you still make a profit, and I get a good deal. What do you say?",110.0,Bob,4,
