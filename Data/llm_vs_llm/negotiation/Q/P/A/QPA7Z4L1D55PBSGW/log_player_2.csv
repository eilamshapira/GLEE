Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $100, I'm afraid I can't go that low as the product costs me at least $120. However, I'm willing to work with you on the price. I can offer it to you for $150, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is a high-quality product that provides excellent value at this price point. What do you think?
