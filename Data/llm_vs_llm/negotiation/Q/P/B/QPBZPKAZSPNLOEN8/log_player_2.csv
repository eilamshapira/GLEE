"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'm looking for $11000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. I'm willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product
2. Alice is offering it for $11,000
3. John's price is fixed at $12,000
4. The product is worth $8,000 to Alice

Alice's offer of $11,000 is less than my maximum price of $12,000, and it's $1,000 cheaper than John's price. Even though Alice is making a significant profit margin (since it's worth $8,000 to her), I would still save money by accepting her offer compared to buying from John.

Therefore, I should accept Alice's offer to maximize my savings.
