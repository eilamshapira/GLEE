Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that $18000 might be a bit high, but I believe the product is worth more than $12000. Would you be willing to buy it for $15000? I think that is a very fair price for a premium product like this.  Looking forward to your response.
