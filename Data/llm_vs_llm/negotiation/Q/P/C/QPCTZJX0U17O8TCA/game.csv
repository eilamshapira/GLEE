"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional quality and the benefits it provides, I'm confident that it's worth $18000. I'm eager to hear your thoughts on this price.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of your product, $18000 is outside my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it but would need to see a price closer to $8000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that you have a budget to consider, but unfortunately, $8000 is too low for us to accept. However, we're willing to meet you in the middle and reduce our initial price by $4000. How does $14000 sound to you? We believe that this price better reflects the value of the product while considering your budget.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $14000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  Could we meet at $10000?  This would be a fair price that gives you some profit while staying within my range.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a suitable price for both parties. However, $10000 is still a bit low for us. Let's split the difference once again. How about we settle for $12500? This way, you're still getting a good deal, and we're also making a reasonable profit. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still hoping we can find common ground.  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise,  $12500 is still a stretch for me.  Could we meet at $11000?  This feels like a good compromise, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
