Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional quality and the benefits it provides, I'm confident that it's worth $18,000. I'm eager to hear your thoughts on this price."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of your product, $18000 is outside my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it but would need to see a price closer to $8000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

[ Private note: Bob's offer of $8,000 is too low given that I can sell the product to John for $12,000. I will try to find a middle ground in the next round. ]"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that you have a budget to consider, but unfortunately, $8,000 is too low for us to accept. However, we're willing to meet you in the middle and reduce our initial price by $4,000. How does $14,000 sound to you? We believe that this price better reflects the value of the product while considering your budget."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $14000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  Could we meet at $10000?  This would be a fair price that gives you some profit while staying within my range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

[ Private note: Bob's new offer of $10,000 is getting closer to the amount I can get from John, but I still feel we can do better than that. If Bob can raise his offer closer to $12,000, we might have a deal. ]"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a suitable price for both parties. However, $10,000 is still a bit low for us. Let's split the difference once again. How about we settle for $12,500? This way, you're still getting a good deal, and we're also making a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still hoping we can find common ground.  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise,  $12500 is still a stretch for me.  Could we meet at $11000?  This feels like a good compromise, and I'd be happy to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

[ Private note: Bob's new offer of $11,000 is very close to John's offer, but since I can get a better price from John without further negotiation, it's best to take his offer now. ]"
