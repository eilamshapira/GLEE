"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional quality and the benefits it provides, I'm confident that it's worth $18000. I'm eager to hear your thoughts on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It makes more sense to reject the offer and see if we can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of your product, $18,000 is outside my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it but would need to see a price closer to $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that you have a budget to consider, but unfortunately, $8000 is too low for us to accept. However, we're willing to meet you in the middle and reduce our initial price by $4000. How does $14000 sound to you? We believe that this price better reflects the value of the product while considering your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still higher than my ideal price but shows she's willing to negotiate. I'll reject and counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $14,000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  Could we meet at $10,000?  This would be a fair price that gives you some profit while staying within my range."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a suitable price for both parties. However, $10000 is still a bit low for us. Let's split the difference once again. How about we settle for $12500? This way, you're still getting a good deal, and we're also making a reasonable profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$12,500 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'm getting close to my limit. If this offer is rejected, I'm likely going to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still hoping we can find common ground.  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise,  $12,500 is still a stretch for me.  Could we meet at $11,000?  This feels like a good compromise, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
