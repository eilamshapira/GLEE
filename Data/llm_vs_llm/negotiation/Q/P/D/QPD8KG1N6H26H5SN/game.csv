"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is quite high for this product. I've done some market research, and I believe a more reasonable price would be $100. This would be a fair price for both of us. Would you consider this offer?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you think $200 is high, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and find a middle ground. I've considered your market research, and I'd like to propose a price that's more reasonable for both of us.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. However, $180 is still more than I can justify spending. I can find similar products from other sellers for around $150. To be fair to you and show that I'm also willing to compromise, I can increase my offer to $120. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, showing my genuine interest in reaching a deal with you.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $120. I appreciate your willingness to compromise and find a mutually beneficial price. However, I still need to get a bit more for the product. I've considered your comparison to similar products from other sellers, and I believe my product has some unique features that justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down further, but I need to ensure I get a fair deal. Let's meet in the middle at $160.",160.0,Alice,5,

"Thanks for coming down to $160, Alice. I can see we're getting closer to an agreement. I need to be transparent with you - I have another seller offering the product for $150, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. I can offer $140, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. This would be a fair price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your transparency about the other seller's offer. I appreciate your preference to do business with me, and I'm willing to work with you to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Since you mentioned that the other seller is offering the product for $150, I'm willing to match that price. Let's close the deal at $150, and I'll ensure you get the product as promised.",150.0,Alice,7,
