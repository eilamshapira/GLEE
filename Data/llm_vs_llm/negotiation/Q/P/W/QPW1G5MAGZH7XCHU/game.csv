"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional quality and the market demand, I'm confident that it's worth $14000. I'm willing to start the negotiation at this point.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but $14000 is significantly above my budget. I'm looking to spend no more than $8500 for this product. This is a fair price considering I have another seller, John, who's offering a similar product at a competitive price. I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that you have a budget to maintain, but I'm afraid $8500 is too low for me to consider. Given that I have another offer on the table, I wouldn't be comfortable going below $13000. I'm sure that we can find some middle ground if you're willing to reconsider your offer price.",13000.0,Alice,3,
