Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but $14000 is significantly above my budget. I'm looking to spend no more than $8500 for this product. This is a fair price considering I have another seller, John, who's offering a similar product at a competitive price. I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that you have a budget to maintain, but I'm afraid $8,500 is too low for me to consider. Given that I have another offer on the table, I wouldn't be comfortable going below $13,000. I'm sure that we can find some middle ground if you're willing to reconsider your offer price."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
