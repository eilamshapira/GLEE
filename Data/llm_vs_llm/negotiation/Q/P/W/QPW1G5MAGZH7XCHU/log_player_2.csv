"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional quality and the market demand, I'm confident that it's worth $14000. I'm willing to start the negotiation at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer against my options.

Alice is offering the product for $14,000, which exceeds my maximum value of $10,000. This means I would be losing at least $4,000 in value if I accepted.

I know that John is willing to sell me the same product for $10,000, which is exactly at my maximum value point.

Given that Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum value and higher than my alternative option, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. If negotiations with Alice don't reach a favorable outcome, I always have the option to buy from John at $10,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but $14,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm looking to spend no more than $8,500 for this product. This is a fair price considering I have another seller, John, who's offering a similar product at a competitive price. I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that you have a budget to maintain, but I'm afraid $8500 is too low for me to consider. Given that I have another offer on the table, I wouldn't be comfortable going below $13000. I'm sure that we can find some middle ground if you're willing to reconsider your offer price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has lowered her offer from $14,000 to $13,000, which shows some flexibility, but it's still $3,000 above my maximum value of $10,000. 

Since John is offering the product at exactly $10,000, which is my maximum value point, accepting Alice's current offer would mean losing $3,000 in value.

The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so there's potential for further negotiation, but I need to consider whether I can realistically get Alice to offer a price below $10,000 (my alternative option).

At this point, I should either make one more counteroffer or simply buy from John. Since Alice has only come down $1,000 from her initial offer and is still quite far from a price that would be acceptable to me, I'll choose to buy from John.
