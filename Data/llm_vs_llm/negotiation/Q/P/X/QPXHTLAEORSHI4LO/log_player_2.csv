"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Considering its rarity and unique features, I'm offering it to you for a price of: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she's selling the product for $1,200,000, which is exactly the same price that John is offering and also exactly the maximum amount the product is worth to me.

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price, and that price equals my maximum valuation, I'm indifferent between the options. I won't save any money regardless of which seller I choose.
