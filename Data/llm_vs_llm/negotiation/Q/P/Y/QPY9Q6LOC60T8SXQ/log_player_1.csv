Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","I'll analyze my options:

1. Accept Bob's offer: $10,000
2. Reject and make a counteroffer
3. Sell to John: $10,000

Since Bob's offer is exactly the same as my minimum acceptable value ($10,000) and equal to John's offer, there's no advantage in selling to John instead of Bob. However, I can try one more round of negotiation with Bob to potentially get a better price.
