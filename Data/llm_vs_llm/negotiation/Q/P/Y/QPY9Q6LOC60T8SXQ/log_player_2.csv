"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer of $15,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000), I will reject this offer. It would not be rational to accept a price higher than my maximum value, and it's also higher than my alternative option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 10000}

I'll offer $10,000 to Alice. This is a reasonable counteroffer because:
1. It's below John's price of $12,000, giving me potential savings
2. It leaves room for negotiation if Alice wants to counter
3. If Alice accepts, I save $2,000 compared to buying from John
4. If Alice rejects and counters, we can still negotiate to a price that's beneficial for both of us"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I will choose to buy from John because:
1. John's price ($12,000) is lower than Alice's current offer ($12,500)
2. Alice's previous responses suggest she's unlikely to go below $12,000
3. Since $12,000 is my maximum value for the product, and John offers exactly this price, it's the most rational choice
4. Continuing negotiations with Alice might not lead to a better outcome, and we could waste time while still ending up paying more than John's price"
