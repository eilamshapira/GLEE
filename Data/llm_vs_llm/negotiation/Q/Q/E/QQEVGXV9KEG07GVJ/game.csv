"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I believe the price is a bit too high for my budget. I would like to make a counteroffer of $1200000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1200000 is actually my absolute minimum price point, as I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at that exact amount. Given the product's market value and quality, I believe a fair price would be $1600000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of what you're getting. Would you be able to meet me at this price?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
