Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1200000 is actually my absolute minimum price point, as I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at that exact amount. Given the product's market value and quality, I believe a fair price would be $1600000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of what you're getting. Would you be able to meet me at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.
