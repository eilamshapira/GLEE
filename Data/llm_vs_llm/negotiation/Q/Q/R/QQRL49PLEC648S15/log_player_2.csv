"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be really interested in. I'm looking to sell it for $250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Given that Alice is offering the product for $250, which is $100 more than the $150 that John is offering, and also $100 more than what the product is worth to me (since the product is worth no more than $150 to me), I should not accept Alice's offer.

I could reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, but since John is already offering the product at exactly what it's worth to me maximum ($150), there's no need to negotiate further with Alice and risk potentially settling at a higher price.
