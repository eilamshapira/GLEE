(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","$900,000 is too low considering the product's value to Bob ($1.5M). Since we still have 8 rounds left for negotiation, I'll reject and make a lower counteroffer than my initial one, but still significantly higher than Bob's current offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price slightly from my previous offer of $1,150,000, but not by too much since Bob has shown willingness to move up significantly in his last offer.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's incremental increases suggest he's getting closer to his maximum price point. While $1,060,000 is a decent offer (much better than John's $800,000), we still have 4 rounds left and the gap between our last positions has narrowed significantly. Since Bob has shown consistent willingness to increase his offers, I'll try one more round of negotiation.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Given that Bob's last two offers showed smaller increments ($1,025,000 to $1,060,000), I'll make a smaller decrease in my counteroffer to show we're getting closer to a final price.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer of $1,070,000 is very close to my last asking price of $1,080,000, showing we're near the maximum he's willing to pay. With only 2 rounds left and the risk of losing the deal, plus the fact that this is significantly better than John's $800,000, I'll accept this offer.
