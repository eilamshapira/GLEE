Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1500000 is significantly above my maximum budget of $1000000. I know I can get this product from another seller for $1000000, but I'd like to work with you. Would you consider $800000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
