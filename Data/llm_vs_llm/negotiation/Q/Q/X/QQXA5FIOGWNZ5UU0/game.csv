"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product seems interesting, but I was hoping to spend a bit less. Would you consider selling it for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $100 is too low for me, I can come down from my initial price. Given the product's quality and value, I can offer it to you for $120. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents good value.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks, Alice. I still think $120 is a bit high for me. How about $90? That's my final offer.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $90 is too low considering the product's true value. I've already reduced the price significantly from my initial offer. I can offer you $110, which is a fair middle ground and represents excellent value given that this product is worth $150. This is my best offer and provides good savings for you while still being reasonable for me.",110.0,Alice,5,
