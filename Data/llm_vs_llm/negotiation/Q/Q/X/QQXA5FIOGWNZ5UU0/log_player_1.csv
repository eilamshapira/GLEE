"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{
    ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $130. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product seems interesting, but I was hoping to spend a bit less. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{
    ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $100 is too low considering the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. There's still room for negotiation to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{
    ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $100 is too low for me, I can come down from my initial price. Given the product's quality and value, I can offer it to you for $120. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents good value."",
    ""product_price"": 120
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks, Alice. I still think $120 is a bit high for me. How about $90? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{
    ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}

I'll make another counteroffer. Even though Bob says this is his final offer, $90 is too close to my minimum price of $80, and I know the product is worth $150 to him. There's still room for a better deal that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{
    ""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $90 is too low considering the product's true value. I've already reduced the price significantly from my initial offer. I can offer you $110, which is a fair middle ground and represents excellent value given that this product is worth $150. This is my best offer and provides good savings for you while still being reasonable for me."",
    ""product_price"": 110
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, Alice. I appreciate the negotiation. However, I'm really trying to stick to my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{
    ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $95. While it's lower than my ideal price, it's still significantly better than my alternative of selling to John for $80. Bob has moved up from his ""final offer"" of $90, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely. A profit of $15 ($95 - $80) is reasonable, and it's best to close the deal now."
