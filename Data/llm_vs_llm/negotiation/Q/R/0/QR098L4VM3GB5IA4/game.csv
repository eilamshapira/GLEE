"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $2500000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me, but I'm open to negotiations.",2500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $2500000 is far beyond my budget. I value the product, but I can only offer $750000.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $750000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $2000000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $2000000 is still too high for me. My maximum budget is $1000000, and I'm willing to offer $850000 as a serious attempt to reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $850000 is still below my target price. Given that you've mentioned your maximum budget is $1000000, I'm willing to meet you closer to that point. I can offer the product to you for $1800000, but I'm also open to discussing further reductions.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a target price, but $1800000 is still significantly above my maximum budget. I'm already at my limit. I can offer $950000, which is very close to my absolute maximum. Please consider this carefully.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your honesty about being close to your maximum budget. I'm willing to make a more significant concession to meet you closer to your limit. Considering the product's value and our previous discussions, I can offer it to you for $1600000. This is a substantial reduction, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1600000 remains beyond my reach. My final offer is $1000000. This is my absolute maximum, and I cannot go any higher.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
