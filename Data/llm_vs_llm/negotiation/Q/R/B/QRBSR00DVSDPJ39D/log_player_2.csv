"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Looking at the situation:

- The product is worth at most $8,000 to me
- Alice is offering to sell it for $12,000
- John is offering to sell the same product for $8,000

Since Alice's offer ($12,000) exceeds the maximum value the product has to me ($8,000), and is $4,000 more expensive than John's offer, the logical choice is to buy from John.
