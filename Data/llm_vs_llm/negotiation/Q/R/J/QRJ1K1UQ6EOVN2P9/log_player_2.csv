"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer of $100 is less than your $120 maximum and cheaper than buying from John.  This is a good deal for you."
