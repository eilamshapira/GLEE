"Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $999,999 is very close to the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,000,000) and also considering that buying from John would cost me the full $1,000,000, it seems more economical to accept Alice's offer to save $1.
