"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $200 is well outside my budget. The product is only worth up to $80 to me, and I can actually purchase the same product from John for exactly $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider selling it for $60? This would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale.",60.0,Bob,2,
