Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have an exclusive product available for you. I'm offering it at $200. Please let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $200 is well outside my budget. The product is only worth up to $80 to me, and I can actually purchase the same product from John for exactly $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider selling it for $60? This would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
