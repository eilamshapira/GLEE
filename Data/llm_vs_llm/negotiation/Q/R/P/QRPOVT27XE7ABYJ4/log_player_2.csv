"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an exclusive product available for you. I'm offering it at $200. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","$200 is far above my maximum budget of $80, and it's also more expensive than John's offer of $80. Since I can get the same product from John for $80, there's no reason to pay Alice $200.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $200 is well outside my budget. The product is only worth up to $80 to me, and I can actually purchase the same product from John for exactly $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider selling it for $60? This would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale."", ""product_price"": 60}"
