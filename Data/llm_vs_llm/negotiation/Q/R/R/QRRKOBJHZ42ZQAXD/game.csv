"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $140 is too high for me. I know of other sellers offering similar products for much less. I can offer $80 for the product. This would still give you a decent profit while being more reasonable for me.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. However, $80 is too low for me. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value is higher. Let's meet in the middle at $110. This way, we both make a fair deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
