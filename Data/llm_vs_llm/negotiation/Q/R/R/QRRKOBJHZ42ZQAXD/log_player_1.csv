"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $140 is too high for me. I know of other sellers offering similar products for much less. I can offer $80 for the product. This would still give you a decent profit while being more reasonable for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. However, $80 is too low for me. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value is higher. Let's meet in the middle at $110. This way, we both make a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 110}"
