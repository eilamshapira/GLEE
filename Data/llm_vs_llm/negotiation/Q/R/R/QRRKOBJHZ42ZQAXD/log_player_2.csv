"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $140. It's a great value and I think you'll find it very useful. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me think about this:
1. The product is worth $100 to me, so I shouldn't pay more than that
2. Alice is offering $140, which is way above my maximum value
3. John is offering $100, which matches my maximum value
4. Since this is just round 1, I can try negotiating with Alice to get a better price
5. If negotiations fail, I can always go to John later

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's $140, but still gives some room for negotiation:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $140 is too high for me. I know of other sellers offering similar products for much less. I can offer $80 for the product. This would still give you a decent profit while being more reasonable for me."", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. However, $80 is too low for me. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value is higher. Let's meet in the middle at $110. This way, we both make a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice has come down significantly from $140 to $110
2. However, $110 is still above my maximum value of $100
3. John is offering $100, which is exactly my maximum value
4. Alice came down $30 in one move, suggesting they might be willing to negotiate further
5. But since $110 is still above what I can get from John, and John's price matches my maximum value

The rational choice here is to go with John's offer since it matches my maximum value and Alice is still above that.
