"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $100, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand that you think the product is worth $100, but I've done some research and I believe it's a bit overpriced. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think this is a more reasonable starting point.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $60. I understand that you've done some research, but I still believe the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to come down from my initial price of $100, but I still need to get at least closer to its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer of $90. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think it's a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer of $60 and your new offer of $90, which would put us at $75. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value and my own budget constraints.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $75. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial price. However, I still need to get a bit more for the product. Considering your offer and the product's value, I'm willing to make a small concession. How about we settle at $85? This is as low as I'm comfortable going, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer of $85. I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still a bit short of my budget, and I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I know this is a low offer, but I'm really interested in the product and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. If I don't get it for $80, I'll have to consider buying it from another seller, John, who is offering it to me for the same price.",80.0,Bob,6,
