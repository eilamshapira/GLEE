"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $100, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand that you think the product is worth $100, but I've done some research and I believe it's a bit overpriced. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think this is a more reasonable starting point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $60 because it's significantly lower than the product's value to me, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $60. I understand that you've done some research, but I still believe the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to come down from my initial price of $100, but I still need to get at least closer to its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer of $90. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think it's a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer of $60 and your new offer of $90, which would put us at $75. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value and my own budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $75 because it's still slightly lower than the product's value to John, which is $80, and I believe I can get at least that much. I'll proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob, trying to get closer to or exceed the $80 threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $75. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial price. However, I still need to get a bit more for the product. Considering your offer and the product's value, I'm willing to make a small concession. How about we settle at $85? This is as low as I'm comfortable going, and I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer of $85. I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still a bit short of my budget, and I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I know this is a low offer, but I'm really interested in the product and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. If I don't get it for $80, I'll have to consider buying it from another seller, John, who is offering it to me for the same price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I accept Bob's offer of $80. Since Bob is now offering the same price that John is willing to pay, and I don't have any guarantee that I can get a better price from Bob in the next rounds, it's reasonable to accept this offer and close the deal. Rejecting this offer and trying to negotiate further may risk losing the sale to John, so I'll accept $80 from Bob."
