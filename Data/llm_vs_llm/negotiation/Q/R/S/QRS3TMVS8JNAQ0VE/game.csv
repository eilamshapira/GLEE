"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $1000000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay for this product. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $800000. I'd prefer to do business with you, so I'm willing to offer $650000 for the product. This gives you a reasonable profit while saving me some money compared to my alternative option. Let me know if this works for you.",650000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to do business with me, $650000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900000. This price still provides you with a good deal while ensuring I receive a fair value for the product. Please let me know your thoughts.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
