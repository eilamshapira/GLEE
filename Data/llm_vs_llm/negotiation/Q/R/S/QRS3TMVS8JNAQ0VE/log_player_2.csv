"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1000000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire something of high value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I notice that Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is actually $200,000 more than it's worth to me (since it's worth no more than $800,000 to me). This is also $200,000 more than what John is offering.

Since Alice's current offer exceeds both my maximum valuation and John's alternative price, the rational decision is to reject this offer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $1,000,000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay for this product. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $800,000. I'd prefer to do business with you, so I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product. This gives you a reasonable profit while saving me some money compared to my alternative option. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to do business with me, $650000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900000. This price still provides you with a good deal while ensuring I receive a fair value for the product. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I notice that Alice has reduced her price to $900,000, which is moving in the right direction, but it's still $100,000 more than John's offer of $800,000. Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and I can get it from John at exactly that price, it would not be financially rational to accept Alice's current offer.

The best option is to buy from John at $800,000, as this matches my maximum valuation and is better than Alice's current offer.
