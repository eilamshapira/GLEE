"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The $120 price from Alice is the same as John's price, and it's at my maximum value for the product. Since Alice's product is worth $100 to her, there's room for negotiation to get a better price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to try to save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 105}

I'll offer $105, which is slightly above Alice's value of $100. This represents a reasonable starting point for negotiation as it allows Alice to make a small profit while being significantly lower than the $120 alternative from John. It leaves room for potential back-and-forth negotiation while still being a fair initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has lowered her price from $120 to $115, showing willingness to negotiate. However, since the product is worth $100 to her, there's still room for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. Even if we don't reach an agreement, I can still fall back on John's $120 offer later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 108}

I'll increase my offer to $108. This is a reasonable step up from my previous offer of $105, showing willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price well below both Alice's last offer of $115 and John's fixed price of $120. This offer would give Alice an $8 profit while still saving me money compared to my alternatives."
