"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's initial offer of $100 is already below my maximum budget of $150, and it's a relatively good price, I'll consider accepting it to save time and ensure I get the product. However, I also want to see if I can get a better deal by negotiating.

Given that $100 is a reasonable starting point and I don't know how low Alice is willing to go, I'll choose to reject the offer and make a counteroffer to try and get an even better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable, to see if she's willing to negotiate further.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has come down from $100 to $90, which shows she's willing to negotiate. Since $90 is still below my maximum budget of $150 and is a better price than her initial offer, I'm inclined to accept it. However, I want to try and get the best possible deal.

Considering Alice has already lowered the price by $10, I'm not sure how much further she's willing to go. If I reject this offer and make another counteroffer, there's a risk she might not be willing to lower the price any more, or she might even raise it back up to $100.

Given that $90 is a good price and I don't want to risk losing this deal, I'll choose to accept Alice's offer.
