"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. Based on market analysis, this product is worth $1000000, and I'm offering it to you for $950000. This represents a $50000 value for you, which I think is a fair deal considering the product's quality and potential return on investment.

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $850000. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, I need to be mindful of the product's true value. Given that this product is worth $1000000 to you, I'm willing to come down to $925000, which still provides you with $75000 in value. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents a fair middle ground between our positions. Would you accept this price?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $875000. This price still allows you to make a profit, while also providing me with a good value. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think $925000 is still a bit high. Let me know if $875000 is something you'd be willing to consider.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your counteroffer of $875000. I can see you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I need to ensure I'm also getting fair value for this product. Let me meet you partway - I can offer the product at $900000, which gives you a substantial $100000 in value while still respecting the product's worth. This is significantly lower than my initial offer and represents my best price considering the product's value to both of us. Can we agree on $900000?",900000.0,Alice,5,
