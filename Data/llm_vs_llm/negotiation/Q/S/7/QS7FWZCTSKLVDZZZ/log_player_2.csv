Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $850000. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, I need to be mindful of the product's true value. Given that this product is worth $1000000 to you, I'm willing to come down to $925000, which still provides you with $75000 in value. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents a fair middle ground between our positions. Would you accept this price?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your counteroffer of $875000. I can see you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I need to ensure I'm also getting fair value for this product. Let me meet you partway - I can offer the product at $900000, which gives you a substantial $100000 in value while still respecting the product's worth. This is significantly lower than my initial offer and represents my best price considering the product's value to both of us. Can we agree on $900000?
