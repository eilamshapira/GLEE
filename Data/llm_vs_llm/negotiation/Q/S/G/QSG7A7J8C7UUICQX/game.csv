"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $750000.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, I must inform you that I have another buyer willing to pay $1000000 for the product. However, I believe this product could provide significant value to you, and I'm willing to continue our negotiation. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1800000, which I believe is fair given the product's potential value. Would you consider this revised offer?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my offer. I understand you have another potential buyer. However, my budget is still limited. I can increase my offer to $850000. This is my best offer at the moment.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but I need to be transparent with you - I have a firm offer of $1000000 from another buyer. I'm still interested in selling to you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Given this situation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1300000, which I believe is still a good value considering its potential worth. If we can't reach an agreement above $1000000, I'll need to proceed with the other buyer. What are your thoughts on this?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
