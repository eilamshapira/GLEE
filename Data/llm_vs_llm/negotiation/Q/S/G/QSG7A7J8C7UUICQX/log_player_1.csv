"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,500,000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential value. Would you be interested in making this investment?"", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $750000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Since I have John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000, I won't accept anything less than that. However, I believe Bob might be willing to negotiate further, so I'll continue the negotiation rather than immediately selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, I must inform you that I have another buyer willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. However, I believe this product could provide significant value to you, and I'm willing to continue our negotiation. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1,800,000, which I believe is fair given the product's potential value. Would you consider this revised offer?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my offer. I understand you have another potential buyer. However, my budget is still limited. I can increase my offer to $850000. This is my best offer at the moment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still below John's guaranteed $1,000,000. While Bob has shown some flexibility by increasing his offer, it's still not competitive with my alternative option. However, I'll make one more attempt to negotiate as Bob might be willing to increase his offer further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but I need to be transparent with you - I have a firm offer of $1,000,000 from another buyer. I'm still interested in selling to you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Given this situation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,300,000, which I believe is still a good value considering its potential worth. If we can't reach an agreement above $1,000,000, I'll need to proceed with the other buyer. What are your thoughts on this?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
