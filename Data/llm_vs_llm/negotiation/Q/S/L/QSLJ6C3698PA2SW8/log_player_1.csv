Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this exclusive product. Considering its value and rarity, I'm offering it to you for $14,000."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer. However, my budget is a bit limited. I can offer $11000 for the product. Let me know if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $11,000, and knowing the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, I have to make a decision that maximizes my profit.

Here's my reasoning:

*   **Accepting Bob's offer:** Gets me $11,000, which is more than selling to John.
*   **Rejecting and Counteroffering:** Could potentially lead to a higher price, but risks losing the sale altogether and potentially ending up with less than $11,000.
*   **Selling to John:** Gets me $10,000.

Therefore, I will:
