"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'll analyze my options:

1. Accepting Alice's offer at $120 would mean paying the maximum amount I'm willing to pay.
2. Buying from John at $120 gives me the same outcome.
3. Rejecting and making a counteroffer gives me a chance to get a better price.

Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. I should try to get a better price than $120.
