"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to make a decision based on the value of the product to me (up to $10,000) and the offers available.

Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which exceeds what the product is worth to me. 
John is offering the same product for $10,000, which is exactly what the product is worth to me.

If I reject Alice's offer, I could make a counteroffer, but there's no guarantee Alice will accept a price below her valuation of $10,000. Since John's offer is already at my maximum valuation, it makes the most sense to go with his offer.
