"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but I think $175 is a bit too high for me. How about I offer you $60 instead?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand it's a great deal for you, but I need to at least get closer to my asking price. How about $120? It's still a good value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $120 is still a bit high for me. Can we settle for $70?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a price that works for us both. $70 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,5,
