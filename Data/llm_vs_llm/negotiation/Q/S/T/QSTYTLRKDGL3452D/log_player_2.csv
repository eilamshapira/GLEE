"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Since you are willing to pay up to $150 for the product, and Alice's offer is $150, accepting the offer is the best option.  There's no advantage to rejecting and buying from John at the same price."
