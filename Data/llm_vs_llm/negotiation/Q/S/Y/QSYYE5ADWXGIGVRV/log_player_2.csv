# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Okay, Alice is offering the product for $14,000. My maximum willingness to pay is $15,000. If I reject Alice's offer, I'll have to buy from John for $15,000. Since $14,000 is less than $15,000, it's better to accept Alice's offer.
