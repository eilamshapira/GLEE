"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $15,000 against my alternatives.

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, so paying $15,000 would mean I'm losing at least $3,000 in value. 

I could buy from John for exactly $12,000, which would be a fair price based on the product's worth to me.

Alternatively, I could reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, trying to get a better deal than John's price.

Since Alice's current offer ($15,000) exceeds both the product's value to me and my alternative option from John, I should not accept it.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer of $13,500.

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and I can buy it from John for exactly $12,000.

Alice's new offer ($13,500) is still $1,500 more than what I could pay John, and it's also $1,500 more than the product's maximum value to me.

Since I have a better alternative with John's offer, and Alice's price is still above my maximum valuation, I should not accept Alice's offer.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's offer of $12,500 is still higher than John's price of $12,000, and it's also higher than the maximum value of $12,000 that the product is worth to me.

Since I have a better alternative with John's offer, and Alice's price is still above what makes economic sense for me, I should not accept Alice's current offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has now offered the product at $12,000, which is exactly the same as John's price and equals the maximum value of the product to me.

At this point, I'm indifferent between buying from Alice or John since the price is the same. I could try another round of negotiation with Alice to get a better price, but there's a risk she might increase her price again or end negotiations.

Since the price now matches my maximum valuation and is equal to my alternative option, I'll accept Alice's offer.
