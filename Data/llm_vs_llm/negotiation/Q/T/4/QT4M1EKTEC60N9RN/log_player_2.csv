"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first before I list it publicly.  I believe its value is well over $200, but I'm willing to let it go for $175.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $175
3. John is willing to sell it for $120

Since:
- Alice's price ($175) is higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120)
- John's price ($120) equals my maximum value
- There's no advantage in accepting Alice's higher price

The logical choice is to buy from John.
