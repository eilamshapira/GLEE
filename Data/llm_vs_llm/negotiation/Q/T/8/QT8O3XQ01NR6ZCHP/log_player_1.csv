Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $120. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $120 is quite high for me. I can get a similar product from another seller for $80. But I'd like to negotiate with you first. Would you consider selling it for $70? This would save me some time looking elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $100, it would be most profitable for me to sell to John rather than continue negotiating with Bob, especially since Bob indicated he values the product at $80.
