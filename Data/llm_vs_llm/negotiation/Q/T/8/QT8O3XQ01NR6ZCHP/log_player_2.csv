"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $120. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $120 is above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). It's better to reject and make a counteroffer, as there might be room for negotiation with Alice. If Alice doesn't agree to a lower price, I can always buy from John at $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $120 is quite high for me. I can get a similar product from another seller for $80. But I'd like to negotiate with you first. Would you consider selling it for $70? This would save me some time looking elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 70}"
