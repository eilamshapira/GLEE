"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

You can likely get a better price than $950,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer is still significantly less than what you're willing to pay, but it shows Alice you're serious about negotiating and are willing to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $925,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, you're still significantly better off if you can get closer to your target of $850,000.  It's worth one more round of negotiation to see if you can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise, offering a price that's closer to Alice's last offer but still within your budget and closer to your desired price point."
