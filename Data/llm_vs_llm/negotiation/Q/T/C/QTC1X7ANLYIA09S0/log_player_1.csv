Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to set a price that maximizes my expected profit, recognizing that the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I have John's guaranteed offer as a backup.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll set a price significantly higher than my guaranteed alternative. This way, if Bob values it highly enough, I can earn more than the $1,000,000 John is offering. If Bob rejects it, I lose nothing as I still have John's offer.
