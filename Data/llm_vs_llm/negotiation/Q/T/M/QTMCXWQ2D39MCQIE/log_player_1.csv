"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product and I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start by making a high offer. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially settle on a higher price than if I started with a lower offer.

{""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and also lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,200,000), and I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate, I will reject Bob's offer.

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer, in an attempt to meet Bob somewhere in the middle and maximize my earnings.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $500,000 and my initial offer was $2,500,000, I'll try to find a middle ground while still being mindful of my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial offer but still reflects the value I believe the product holds.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's new offer of $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Since I have 6 rounds left to negotiate and Bob has increased his offer from $500,000 to $700,000, it indicates that he is willing to pay more for the product. However, his current offer is not satisfactory.

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, making a new counteroffer that is lower than my previous one but still above $1,200,000, in an attempt to bring Bob closer to my minimum acceptable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Considering Bob's latest offer was $700,000 and I want to encourage him to meet my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than my previous offer of $2,000,000 but still higher than Bob's current offer. This should signal to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but won't go below a certain threshold.
