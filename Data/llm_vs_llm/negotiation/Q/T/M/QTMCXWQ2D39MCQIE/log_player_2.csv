"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer ($2,500,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's alternative price ($1,000,000), it makes sense to reject this offer. In the next round, I can make a counteroffer that better aligns with my valuation of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 500000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $500,000, which is half of my maximum value and John's price. This gives room for negotiation while potentially securing a better deal than John's $1,000,000 offer. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $2,000,000 is still double the price of both my maximum value and John's alternative price ($1,000,000). While Alice has reduced her price by $500,000, it's still not a reasonable offer given my alternatives. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a price closer to my target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'll increase my previous offer to $700,000. This shows willingness to negotiate upward while still staying well below John's price of $1,000,000. This offer allows me to potentially save $300,000 compared to John's price, while also showing Alice that I'm willing to move significantly from my initial offer. If Alice rejects this, we still have several rounds to negotiate, or I can fall back on John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'm choosing to buy from John for $1,000,000. Here's why:

1. Alice's latest offer ($1,500,000) is still significantly above John's price ($1,000,000)
2. The pattern of negotiations suggests Alice is unlikely to go below $1,000,000 in future rounds
3. Even though we have more rounds available, there's no guarantee Alice will ever match or beat John's price
4. Since $1,000,000 is also my maximum value for the product, John's price is already at my upper limit

It's most rational to secure the deal with John rather than continue negotiations that may not lead to a better outcome."
