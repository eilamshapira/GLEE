"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be of significant value to your business. While I can't disclose the details just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $1500000 to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. This represents a substantial savings for you and a fantastic opportunity to gain a competitive edge. What do you say?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to carefully consider this offer from Alice.

Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, while John is selling it for $1,500,000. The product is worth at most $1,500,000 to me.

If I accept Alice's offer, I would save $300,000 compared to buying from John. Since Alice's price ($1,200,000) is below my maximum valuation ($1,500,000), and it's better than John's price, accepting Alice's offer would be the rational choice.
