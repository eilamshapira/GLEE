"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $2,500,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum valuation of $800,000. In fact, it's more than three times what the product is worth to me.

Since I know I can buy the product from John for exactly $800,000, and this matches my maximum valuation, there's no reason to accept Alice's much higher offer or continue negotiating when the starting point is so far from my acceptable range.
