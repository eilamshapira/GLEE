"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is only worth $8,000 to me, and Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is way too high, I'll start with a low offer that gives room for negotiation but is still reasonable given her cost of $12,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's new offer of $14,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative price ($8,000), and Alice seems to be making only small concessions, I'll choose to buy from John.
