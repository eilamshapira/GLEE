Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

My next offer will be: 
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to make an offer. However, $80 is below the product's value to me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Here's a revised offer."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to make an offer. However, $80 is below the product's value to me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer matches the minimum value I'm willing to accept, and it's the same as John's offer, I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
