"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay for this product. I have another seller offering me the same product for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable price. Would you consider accepting $60 for the product?",60.0,Bob,2,
