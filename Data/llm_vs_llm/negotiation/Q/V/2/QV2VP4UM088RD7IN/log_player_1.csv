"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay for this product. I have another seller offering me the same product for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable price. Would you consider accepting $60 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
