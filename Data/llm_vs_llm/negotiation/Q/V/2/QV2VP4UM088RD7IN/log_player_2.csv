"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product today for $200. This is a great, high-quality item that I believe has significant value. Please let me know if you'd like to proceed with this offer or if you'd prefer to discuss a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $200 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $80 for the product. It's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $80. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to Alice, but if we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay for this product. I have another seller offering me the same product for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable price. Would you consider accepting $60 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 60}"
