"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $250 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $75 for the product. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $75 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand budget constraints, I simply cannot go below $200 for this high-quality product. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer. Would you be able to meet me at this price?",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down to $200, Alice. However, that's still a bit high for me. I can stretch my budget to $90. Is that something you can work with?",90.0,Bob,4,
