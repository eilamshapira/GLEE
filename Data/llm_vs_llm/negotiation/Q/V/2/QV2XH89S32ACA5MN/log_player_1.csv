"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional value and features, I'm offering it at $250. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $250 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $75 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $75 is far too low as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $75 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand budget constraints, I simply cannot go below $200 for this high-quality product. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer. Would you be able to meet me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down to $200, Alice. However, that's still a bit high for me. I can stretch my budget to $90. Is that something you can work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offers are consistently well below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and he's only increased his offer by $15 (from $75 to $90), it seems unlikely that we'll reach an agreement at a price that works for me. Therefore, I'll take John's guaranteed offer of $150."
