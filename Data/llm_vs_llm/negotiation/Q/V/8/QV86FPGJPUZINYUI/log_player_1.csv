"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $950,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is a decent offer, I'm still hoping for a better deal.  I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm willing to compromise, but I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $900,000. This is a reasonable compromise that shows I'm willing to work with Bob, but it still gives me a good profit.  I believe this price is fair and hopefully will convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a bit more. $875,000 is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

I'm going to try one more time with a counteroffer of $890,000. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal. If he rejects this, I'm going to consider selling to John."
