Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $12,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $12,000
3. Bob can only accept or reject my offer
4. If I offer too high, Bob might reject, but I still get $12,000 from John
5. If I offer slightly above $12,000, Bob might accept since the difference is small

Given these factors, I'll offer slightly above $12,000 to try to maximize my profit while keeping the offer reasonable enough that Bob might accept.
