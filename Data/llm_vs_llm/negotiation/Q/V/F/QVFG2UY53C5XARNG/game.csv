"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer this product to you at a price of $20000. It's a high-quality product and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $20000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, which is the price I can get from another seller. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $6000 for the product, which gives us both room to negotiate to a price that works for both of us.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I cannot sell the product for less than $12000, which is my minimum acceptable price. How about we settle at $16000? This product offers great value and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for being willing to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate that you've come down from your initial price. However, I have a firm alternative offer of $10000 from another seller. Since that's my maximum budget for this product, I can't go higher than $9000 for your product. This still gives you a better deal than the $6000 I initially offered, and allows me to justify doing business with you rather than your competitor.",9000.0,Bob,4,
