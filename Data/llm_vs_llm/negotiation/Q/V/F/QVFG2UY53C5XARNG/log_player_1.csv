Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $20000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, which is the price I can get from another seller. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $6000 for the product, which gives us both room to negotiate to a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I cannot sell the product for less than $12,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. How about we settle at $16,000? This product offers great value and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for being willing to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate that you've come down from your initial price. However, I have a firm alternative offer of $10000 from another seller. Since that's my maximum budget for this product, I can't go higher than $9000 for your product. This still gives you a better deal than the $6000 I initially offered, and allows me to justify doing business with you rather than your competitor. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
