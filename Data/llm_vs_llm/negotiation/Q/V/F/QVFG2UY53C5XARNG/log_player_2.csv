"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer this product to you at a price of $20000. It's a high-quality product and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's offer of $20,000 is twice as much as the product is worth to me (max $10,000) and exactly twice what I can buy it from John for. There's no reason to accept this offer, and I should either reject and make a counteroffer or buy from John directly. Since I have negotiation rounds available and might get a better deal than John's price, I'll reject and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $20,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, which is the price I can get from another seller. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $6,000 for the product, which gives us both room to negotiate to a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I cannot sell the product for less than $12000, which is my minimum acceptable price. How about we settle at $16000? This product offers great value and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has come down from $20,000 to $16,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still considerably higher than John's price of $10,000. Alice mentioned her minimum acceptable price is $12,000, which is still above what I can get from John. Since I can get the product for $10,000 from John, there's no reason to accept a price higher than that from Alice. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer closer to what I'm willing to pay.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for being willing to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate that you've come down from your initial price. However, I have a firm alternative offer of $10,000 from another seller. Since that's my maximum budget for this product, I can't go higher than $9,000 for your product. This still gives you a better deal than the $6,000 I initially offered, and allows me to justify doing business with you rather than your competitor."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
