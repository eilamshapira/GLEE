"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! Considering its value and the unique opportunity it presents, I'm offering it to you for $25000.",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $25000 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. The product is worth no more than $15000 to me, and I have another seller (John) willing to sell it to me at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer you $12000 for the product. This saves me some money compared to my alternative, while still giving you a reasonable deal considering the product is worth $15000 to you.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and the fact that you prefer to do business with me. However, I value this product much higher than $12000. Considering its exceptional features and the investment I've made, I'm willing to lower my price to $22000. This is still a significant discount from my original offer. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on your price, Alice, but $22000 is still significantly above what makes economic sense for me. As I mentioned, the product is worth no more than $15000 to me, and I can buy it from John at exactly that price. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I need a better deal. I can offer $13500. This would save me $1500 compared to buying from John, while still giving you a reasonable return since the product is worth $15000 to you.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. I'm prepared to offer the product to you for $20000. This is still a substantial premium for the features of the product compared to the offer from John. Let me know if this is acceptable.",20000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and the reduction in price, but $20000 is still significantly above what makes sense for my budget. As I've mentioned, the product is worth no more than $15000 to me, and I can purchase it from John at that price. I'm willing to offer you $14000, which is getting close to my maximum value but still gives me some benefit for choosing to do business with you rather than John. This also provides you with a reasonable deal since the product is worth $15000 to you.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing that we're still quite far apart on price. I'm willing to offer you the product for $18000. This price reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good deal considering the benefits it offers. If you were to purchase it, I would be happy to offer you some additional services or warranty to sweeten the deal.",18000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price and your offer of additional services. However, I need to be clear that the product's maximum value to me is $15000, which is exactly what John is charging. For me to choose you over John, I need to save money, not spend more. I can offer you $14500, which is very close to my maximum budget but still gives me a small advantage over going with John. This is my best offer, as paying more than $15000 simply doesn't make economic sense for me, regardless of additional services.",14500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you close to your maximum. I'll offer you the product for $17000. This is the lowest I can go. I believe you will not find another offer that is as valuable as mine. I am offering to extend the warranty for one year, to demonstrate my commitment to giving you the best service. This is my final offer.",17000.0,Alice,9,
