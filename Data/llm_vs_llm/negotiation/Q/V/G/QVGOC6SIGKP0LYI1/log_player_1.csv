"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! Considering its value and the unique opportunity it presents, I'm offering it to you for $25,000."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $25000 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. The product is worth no more than $15000 to me, and I have another seller (John) willing to sell it to me at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer you $12000 for the product. This saves me some money compared to my alternative, while still giving you a reasonable deal considering the product is worth $15000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Okay, here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and the fact that you prefer to do business with me. However, I value this product much higher than $12,000. Considering its exceptional features and the investment I've made, I'm willing to lower my price to $22,000. This is still a significant discount from my original offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on your price, Alice, but $22000 is still significantly above what makes economic sense for me. As I mentioned, the product is worth no more than $15000 to me, and I can buy it from John at exactly that price. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I need a better deal. I can offer $13500. This would save me $1500 compared to buying from John, while still giving you a reasonable return since the product is worth $15000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Okay, here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. I'm prepared to offer the product to you for $20,000. This is still a substantial premium for the features of the product compared to the offer from John. Let me know if this is acceptable."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and the reduction in price, but $20000 is still significantly above what makes sense for my budget. As I've mentioned, the product is worth no more than $15000 to me, and I can purchase it from John at that price. I'm willing to offer you $14000, which is getting close to my maximum value but still gives me some benefit for choosing to do business with you rather than John. This also provides you with a reasonable deal since the product is worth $15000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing that we're still quite far apart on price. I'm willing to offer you the product for $18,000. This price reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good deal considering the benefits it offers. If you were to purchase it, I would be happy to offer you some additional services or warranty to sweeten the deal."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price and your offer of additional services. However, I need to be clear that the product's maximum value to me is $15000, which is exactly what John is charging. For me to choose you over John, I need to save money, not spend more. I can offer you $14500, which is very close to my maximum budget but still gives me a small advantage over going with John. This is my best offer, as paying more than $15000 simply doesn't make economic sense for me, regardless of additional services. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","My decision is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","This is getting close. I need to think strategically here. I could potentially get more from Bob, but I risk losing the sale altogether. Considering the time and effort I've put into this, and the potential for further reductions, I'm going to make a final offer.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you close to your maximum. I'll offer you the product for $17,000. This is the lowest I can go. I believe you will not find another offer that is as valuable as mine. I am offering to extend the warranty for one year, to demonstrate my commitment to giving you the best service. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
