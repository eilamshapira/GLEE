"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! Considering its value and the unique opportunity it presents, I'm offering it to you for $25000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's asking for $25,000 for a product that's worth at most $15,000 to me. This is significantly above my maximum value, and I know I can buy the same product from John for exactly $15,000.

Given that I can get the product from John at a better price that matches my maximum value, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $25,000 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and I have another seller (John) willing to sell it to me at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer you $12,000 for the product. This saves me some money compared to my alternative, while still giving you a reasonable deal considering the product is worth $15,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and the fact that you prefer to do business with me. However, I value this product much higher than $12000. Considering its exceptional features and the investment I've made, I'm willing to lower my price to $22000. This is still a significant discount from my original offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price, but $22,000 is still well above the $15,000 maximum value the product has to me, and it's also above John's price of $15,000. There's no reason for me to accept this offer when I have a better alternative.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on your price, Alice, but $22,000 is still significantly above what makes economic sense for me. As I mentioned, the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and I can buy it from John at exactly that price. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I need a better deal. I can offer $13,500. This would save me $1,500 compared to buying from John, while still giving you a reasonable return since the product is worth $15,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 13500}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. I'm prepared to offer the product to you for $20000. This is still a substantial premium for the features of the product compared to the offer from John. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has lowered her price to $20,000, but this is still $5,000 above the maximum value of $15,000 that the product is worth to me, and it's also $5,000 more than John's offer.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and the reduction in price, but $20,000 is still significantly above what makes sense for my budget. As I've mentioned, the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and I can purchase it from John at that price. I'm willing to offer you $14,000, which is getting close to my maximum value but still gives me some benefit for choosing to do business with you rather than John. This also provides you with a reasonable deal since the product is worth $15,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing that we're still quite far apart on price. I'm willing to offer you the product for $18000. This price reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good deal considering the benefits it offers. If you were to purchase it, I would be happy to offer you some additional services or warranty to sweeten the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has lowered her price to $18,000 and mentioned additional services or warranty, but the fundamental issue remains: the product is worth at most $15,000 to me, and I can buy it from John for exactly $15,000. Even with additional services, paying $3,000 more than my maximum value doesn't make economic sense.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price and your offer of additional services. However, I need to be clear that the product's maximum value to me is $15,000, which is exactly what John is charging. For me to choose you over John, I need to save money, not spend more. I can offer you $14,500, which is very close to my maximum budget but still gives me a small advantage over going with John. This is my best offer, as paying more than $15,000 simply doesn't make economic sense for me, regardless of additional services."", ""product_price"": 14500}"

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you close to your maximum. I'll offer you the product for $17000. This is the lowest I can go. I believe you will not find another offer that is as valuable as mine. I am offering to extend the warranty for one year, to demonstrate my commitment to giving you the best service. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has made her ""final offer"" of $17,000 with an extended warranty. While she's moved closer to my maximum value, she's still asking $2,000 more than what the product is worth to me and $2,000 more than John's price. The extended warranty might have some value, but unlikely to be worth $2,000 to me given that my maximum valuation for the entire product is $15,000.

At this point, John's offer is clearly better for me economically.
