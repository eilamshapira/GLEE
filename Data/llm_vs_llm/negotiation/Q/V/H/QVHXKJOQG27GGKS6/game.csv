"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I can offer $8000 for the product, which I think is a fair price given my valuation. Let me know if we can work something out.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $8000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product for $11500.  This price reflects the value I place on it, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
