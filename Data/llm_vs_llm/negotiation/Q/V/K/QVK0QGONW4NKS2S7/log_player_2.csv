"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $100. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth $80 to me (maximum I'm willing to pay)
2. Alice is offering it for $100
3. John is offering it for $80

Since Alice's offer ($100) is higher than both:
- The maximum value I place on the product ($80)
- John's alternative offer ($80)

It makes the most sense to buy from John. I'll get the product at a price that matches my maximum valuation, and I won't overpay.
