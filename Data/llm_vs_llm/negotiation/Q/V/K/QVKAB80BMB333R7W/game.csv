"Hello Alice, thanks for offering! That price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $80 is significantly below the product's value. Given the quality and features of the product, I can come down to $200. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair offer for what you're getting.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $200 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $140?  That's a fair compromise.",140.0,Bob,4,
