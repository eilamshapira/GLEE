Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $250. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for offering! That price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $80 is well below my minimum value of $150, and I can still negotiate for a better price than John's $150 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $80 is significantly below the product's value. Given the quality and features of the product, I can come down to $200. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair offer for what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $200 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $140?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $150 since Bob's offer of $140 is below what I can get from John, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will lead to a better price."
