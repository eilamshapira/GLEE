"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","This is a tough spot! Bob's offer is well below my minimum. Considering my options:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100:** This guarantees a sale, but at a significant loss.
*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer:** This is risky. Bob might not budge, and I could end up with nothing.
*   **(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120:** This is a guaranteed profit of $0 but it is above my minimum.

I am going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, let's analyze the options again:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140:** This yields a $20 profit.
*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer:** This is risky, and it is unknown if the price will go up or down.
*   **(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120:** This is a guaranteed profit of $0.

At this point, $140 is more appealing than the other option.
