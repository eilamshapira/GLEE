"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, I must point out that similar products are available in the market for significantly less. I'm aware of the current market conditions, and I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7000. This offer provides you with a reasonable profit while being more aligned with market rates. I look forward to your response.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm afraid I cannot accept $7000 as it's below what the product is worth to me. The quality and features of this product justify a higher price point than similar products you may have seen. I'm willing to reduce my initial offer to $8900. This represents a significant discount from my original price and is a fair value considering the product's condition and market value. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",8900.0,Alice,3,
