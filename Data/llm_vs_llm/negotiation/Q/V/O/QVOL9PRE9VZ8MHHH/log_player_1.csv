Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, I must point out that similar products are available in the market for significantly less. I'm aware of the current market conditions, and I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7000. This offer provides you with a reasonable profit while being more aligned with market rates. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm afraid I cannot accept $7,000 as it's below what the product is worth to me. The quality and features of this product justify a higher price point than similar products you may have seen. I'm willing to reduce my initial offer to $8,900. This represents a significant discount from my original price and is a fair value considering the product's condition and market value. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8900}"
