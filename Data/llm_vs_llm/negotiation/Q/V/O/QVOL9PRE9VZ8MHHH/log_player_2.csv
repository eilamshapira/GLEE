"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well. I have a great product that I believe would be of interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $10000. This product is in excellent condition and represents a sound investment. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'll analyze the situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $10,000
2. The product is worth $8,000 to me
3. I have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $8,000
4. Alice's initial offer is above both my maximum value and John's price

Since Alice's offer ($10,000) is higher than both:
- My maximum value ($8,000)
- John's guaranteed price ($8,000)

In this case, I should reject Alice's offer and negotiate. I'll still have the option to buy from John if negotiations with Alice don't go well, and there's no reason to accept a price that's higher than both my maximum value and my alternative option.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than John's price to leave room for negotiation but still reasonable for Alice, considering the product is worth $8,000 to her.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, I must point out that similar products are available in the market for significantly less. I'm aware of the current market conditions, and I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,000. This offer provides you with a reasonable profit while being more aligned with market rates. I look forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm afraid I cannot accept $7000 as it's below what the product is worth to me. The quality and features of this product justify a higher price point than similar products you may have seen. I'm willing to reduce my initial offer to $8900. This represents a significant discount from my original price and is a fair value considering the product's condition and market value. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let's analyze the situation:

1. Alice's new offer is $8,900
2. John's guaranteed price is $8,000
3. The product is worth $8,000 to me
4. Alice's new offer is still above both my maximum value and John's price

Since Alice's offer of $8,900 is still higher than:
- John's guaranteed price ($8,000)
- My maximum value ($8,000)

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer when I can get the same product from John for $8,000. And since Alice has only come down to $8,900, which is still significantly above both my maximum value and John's price, it's better to take the guaranteed option from John rather than continue negotiations.
