"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's offer of $250 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $150, and it's also higher than John's price of $150. It doesn't make sense to accept this offer. I should either reject it and make a counteroffer or buy from John immediately.

Since I have 10 rounds of negotiation available and my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'll try negotiating with Alice first to see if I can get the price below John's $150 offer.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $240. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $240
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice only reduced her price from $250 to $240, which is still well above both my maximum value of $150 and John's offer of $150. This suggests Alice might not be willing to come down to a price below John's offer quickly. However, I still have plenty of rounds left, so I'll try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $230. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $230
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has only reduced her price by $10 each time (from $250 to $240 to $230), which is still significantly above John's price of $150. At this rate of reduction, it would take many more rounds to reach a price below $150, and we only have 10 rounds total.

Since Alice doesn't seem willing to offer a competitive price and her current offer ($230) is still much higher than John's price ($150), I'll reject and make one final counteroffer closer to her range to see if we can reach a middle ground.
