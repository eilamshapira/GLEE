Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my offer to Bob. The product is worth $1,500,000 to him, but I know I can sell it to John for $1,000,000 if Bob declines. 

I could offer Bob a price slightly below his valuation to ensure he accepts, giving him some surplus value while maximizing my profit. If I price it too high, he might reject it, and I'd only get $1,000,000 from John.

A reasonable approach would be to offer Bob the product at a price that gives him some incentive to accept while capturing most of the value for myself.
