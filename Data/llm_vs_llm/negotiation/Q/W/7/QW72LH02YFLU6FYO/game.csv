"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its features and market value, I'm offering it at $14000. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and longevity.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. However, the price is a bit too high for me. Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $7000.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I can't accept $7000 for this product. Its value to me is significantly higher than that. I understand you have budget constraints, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price. I can come down to $13000, which is already a reduction from my initial offer. Additionally, I should mention that I have another interested buyer willing to pay $12000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my offer. I understand your position. However, $13000 is still above what I can comfortably spend. Given my budget, the maximum I'm willing to pay is $7500.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but $7500 is still well below the product's value. I have another buyer ready to pay $12000, which is my absolute minimum acceptable price for this product. However, I'd still prefer to work with you. My final offer is $12500 - just slightly above what my other buyer is willing to pay. If we can't reach an agreement at this price point, I'll need to proceed with the other offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
