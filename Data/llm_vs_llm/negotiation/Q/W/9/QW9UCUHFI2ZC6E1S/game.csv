"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product's potential value, $20000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $8000 as a starting point for our negotiation. I believe this is a reasonable offer considering market alternatives.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $8000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's value and the fact that I have other interested buyers, I'm willing to make a concession and offer it to you for $18000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but $18000 remains too high for me.  I can increase my offer to $9500. This reflects the upper limit of my budget while acknowledging the product's unique qualities.  Let me know if this works for you.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. Considering your interest in the product and the fact that we're getting closer to a mutually acceptable price, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer the product to you for $16000. If this is still too high, I'm open to further negotiations.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're making progress.  I'm willing to stretch my budget further and offer $10500. This is a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my serious interest.  I'm hopeful we can close the deal soon.",10500.0,Bob,6,
