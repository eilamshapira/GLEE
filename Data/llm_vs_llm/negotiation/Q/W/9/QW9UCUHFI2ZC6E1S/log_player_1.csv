"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product's potential value, $20000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $8000 as a starting point for our negotiation. I believe this is a reasonable offer considering market alternatives. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is below the minimum value I'm willing to accept ($10,000), and I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $8,000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's value and the fact that I have other interested buyers, I'm willing to make a concession and offer it to you for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but $18000 remains too high for me.  I can increase my offer to $9500. This reflects the upper limit of my budget while acknowledging the product's unique qualities.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Although Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $10,000 I can get from John. I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better price, hoping to get at least $10,000 or more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. Considering your interest in the product and the fact that we're getting closer to a mutually acceptable price, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer the product to you for $16,000. If this is still too high, I'm open to further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're making progress.  I'm willing to stretch my budget further and offer $10500. This is a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my serious interest.  I'm hopeful we can close the deal soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $10,500 is above the minimum price I was willing to accept ($10,000), and it's more than what John is offering. Since I've been trying to maximize my earnings, accepting Bob's offer at this point seems like the best decision, as further negotiations may not yield a significantly better price."
