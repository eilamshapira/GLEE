"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of finding a middle ground between our initial offers. Considering the product's exceptional value, I'm willing to lower my price to $1800000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further negotiations.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, $1800000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $1400000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me and my budget constraints.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price. Considering the product's value and the progress we've made in our negotiations, I'm willing to lower my price to $1700000. However, I'd like to propose an alternative: I can meet you halfway between your current offer and my new price, which would be $1550000, if you're willing to make a decision within the next two rounds. This way, we can both benefit from a faster conclusion to our negotiations.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer and the alternative proposal. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. Considering the product's value and the progress we've made, I'm willing to accept your alternative proposal of meeting halfway, but I'd like to use my previous offer of $1400000 as the basis. This would put the price at $1550000, as you mentioned. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to $1525000, which I believe is a fair compromise. I'm willing to make a decision within the next round if we can agree on this price.",1525000.0,Bob,6,
