"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1800000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1400000 for the product, given its value to me.  This is a fair price considering the market value and my own assessment.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
