Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,800,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1800000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1400000 for the product, given its value to me.  This is a fair price considering the market value and my own assessment.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
