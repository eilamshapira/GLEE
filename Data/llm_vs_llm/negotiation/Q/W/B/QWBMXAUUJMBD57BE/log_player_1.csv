Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider the optimal price to offer Bob. The product is worth at least $120 to me (since I can definitely sell it to John for that amount). I want to maximize my earnings, but if I set the price too high, Bob might reject it.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I should set a price that's reasonably higher than my $120 minimum, giving me a better profit while still having a chance of Bob accepting it.
