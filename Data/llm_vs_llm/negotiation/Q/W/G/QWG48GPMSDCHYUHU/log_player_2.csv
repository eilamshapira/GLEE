{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a lower price.

However, for now, I'll reject her offer and think about my next move.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to meet Alice halfway between my previous offer of $8,000 and her current offer of $14,000. A reasonable counteroffer would be around $11,000. However, since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I'll offer a slightly lower price.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $13,000 is still above my budget of $10,000. Considering that I have the option to buy the product from John for $10,000, I'm not willing to go much higher than that.

Since Alice is slowly decreasing her price, I'll reject her offer again and try to make another counteroffer. However, I'll keep in mind that I have a better option available with John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is closer to my budget of $10,000, but still slightly higher to show that I'm willing to negotiate. Since Alice's last offer was $13,000, I'll try to split the difference between that and my target price of $10,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $12,500 is still above my budget of $10,000. At this point, I'm not willing to pay more than $10,000 for the product, and I have a better option available with John.

Considering that Alice's price is not coming down quickly enough, and I have a limited number of rounds left, I think it's time to consider buying from John.
