Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I've put a lot of value into. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. Let me know what you think!,18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $4000 for it. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $4000 is significantly lower than I can accept. How about we meet at $16500? I believe this is a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts!",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $16500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $5500, which is the highest I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm hoping we can continue to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.",5500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! Thank you for your patience. I understand $5500 is what you can manage, but it's still too low for me. How about I offer you a lower price of $15000? This is the minimum I can accept, and it's a great value for the product. Let me know if that works for you!",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the lower price, but $15000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $6500, which is getting closer to the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can continue to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. If not, I may have to consider other options.",6500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I appreciate your continued interest and your latest offer of $6500. However, I still need to move a bit higher. How about we settle at $14000? It's a fair deal and I'd love to make this work for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to lower the price. However, $14000 is still above what I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $7000, which is very close to my maximum budget. If we can't meet at this price, I may need to consider other options that are more within my budget.",7000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! Thank you for your offer of $7000. I understand itâ€™s a stretch for your budget. However, I can only go down to $13000 for this product. I hope we can find a way to make this work! Let me know your decision!",13000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but $13000 is still above what I'm willing to pay. As this is the last round, I'm willing to make one final offer of $7500. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from another seller who is offering it to me for $8000, which is still within my budget. I hope we can come to an agreement.",7500.0,Bob,10,
