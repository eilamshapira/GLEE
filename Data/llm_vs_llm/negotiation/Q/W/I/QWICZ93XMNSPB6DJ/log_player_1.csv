Send your offer to Bob.,"I'm going to analyze this situation carefully.

Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, he will only accept offers of $100 or less. If I offer more than $100, he'll reject it.

If Bob rejects my offer, I'll sell to John for $100. This means I'm guaranteed $100 no matter what.

Given that Bob will only accept prices of $100 or less, and I already have a guaranteed $100 from John if Bob rejects, the optimal strategy is to offer Bob exactly $100.
