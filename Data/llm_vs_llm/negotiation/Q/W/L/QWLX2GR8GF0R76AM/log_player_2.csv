"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I should analyze this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $120, which is significantly above my maximum value of $80. Since I know the product is worth $100 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.

However, I already have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $80, which is exactly my maximum value. This means I would get no surplus value from that purchase.

I should reject Alice's current offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better deal than $80.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that acknowledges Alice's position while trying to secure a better deal than my alternative.

{""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has only reduced her price from $120 to $110, which is still well above my maximum value of $80. Since I can buy the product from John for $80 (which is my maximum value point), there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $110.

I should reject this offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get Alice to offer a price below $80, which would give me more value than buying from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but still aim for a price that would be better than my alternative option with John.

{""product_price"": 65}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer of $105 is still significantly above my maximum value of $80 and above John's price of $80. There's no reason for me to accept this offer when I have a better alternative.

I'll reject her offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly again to show I'm negotiating in good faith, but I need to keep my offer below $80 to make this deal worthwhile compared to my alternative.

{""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has lowered her offer to $100, which is her cost price according to the information provided. However, this is still above both my maximum value of $80 and John's price of $80. 

There's no reason for me to accept this offer when I have a better alternative with John. I'll reject and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I need to make it clear to Alice that I have an alternative option at $80, and that for us to reach a deal, she needs to offer me something better than that. I'll make a more substantial counteroffer that might be more appealing to her while still being beneficial for me.

{""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer of $95 is still above my maximum value of $80 and above John's price of $80. Since I have a better alternative with John, there's no reason for me to accept this offer.

We're now in round 9 of 10, so I have one more opportunity to make a counteroffer after this rejection. Given the pattern of negotiation so far, it seems unlikely Alice will go below $80 in the final round, so this might be my last chance to clearly explain my position.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","This is my final opportunity to make an offer to Alice. I need to be clear and direct:
