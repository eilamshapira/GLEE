"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to pay $100 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to pay $100 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 100}

I am assuming that the value of the product is at least $80 to me, so I would prefer not to sell it for $80. I am trying to find a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's counteroffer. I chose $100 as the midpoint between the two prices."
