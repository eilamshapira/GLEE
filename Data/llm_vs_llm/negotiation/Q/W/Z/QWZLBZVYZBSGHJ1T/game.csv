"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $1500000 is actually the same price I can get from another seller, John. For me to choose your product over the alternative, I would need a better price. I'm willing to offer $1100000, which I believe is fair and would make this a win-win situation for both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand where you're coming from. Given the exceptional quality and investment value of this product, I'm prepared to adjust my offer. How about $1350000? I believe this price aligns well with both the premium nature of this product and the competitive landscape. Let me know your thoughts on this revised proposal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your product does look promising, but I'm still trying to manage my budget effectively. I can offer $1200000, which would be a substantial purchase while still giving you a good return. This would help me justify choosing your product over alternatives. Does that work for you?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
