Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $1500000 is actually the same price I can get from another seller, John. For me to choose your product over the alternative, I would need a better price. I'm willing to offer $1100000, which I believe is fair and would make this a win-win situation for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
