"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my exclusive product at $1500000. This product represents outstanding quality and value, and I believe it's an excellent investment. Please let me know if you'd like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'm evaluating Alice's offer of $1,500,000 for the product. This price is exactly the same as what John is offering and also equals the maximum value of the product to me. Since there's no advantage to accepting this particular offer (I wouldn't save any money compared to buying from John), and I have the opportunity to negotiate for a better price, I should try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $1,500,000 is actually the same price I can get from another seller, John. For me to choose your product over the alternative, I would need a better price. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000, which I believe is fair and would make this a win-win situation for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand where you're coming from. Given the exceptional quality and investment value of this product, I'm prepared to adjust my offer. How about $1350000? I believe this price aligns well with both the premium nature of this product and the competitive landscape. Let me know your thoughts on this revised proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her price to $1,350,000, which is $150,000 less than John's price and my maximum value. This is a significant improvement, but there may still be room to negotiate a better deal. Since we're only in round 3 of 10 possible rounds, I have time to continue negotiating.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your product does look promising, but I'm still trying to manage my budget effectively. I can offer $1,200,000, which would be a substantial purchase while still giving you a good return. This would help me justify choosing your product over alternatives. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
