"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product. I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1500000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $1200000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I can offer you a slightly lower price, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's try to meet in the middle.",1425000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value you place on the product, $1425000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1300000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid to $1300000. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can offer you a price of $1375000, which is a significant concession on my part. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
