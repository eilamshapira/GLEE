Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product. I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I reject Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll make a counteroffer to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My next offer will be slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer, to see if we can meet in the middle. 

My counteroffer: $1,425,000"

I understand that $1,500,000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value you place on the product, $1425000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1300000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.

I reject Bob's offer because it's still lower than my desired price. Although Bob has increased his offer to $1,300,000, I believe I can get a better deal. Since I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1,500,000, I'll try to negotiate further with Bob to see if he can meet me closer to my target price.

My next counteroffer will be slightly lower than my previous one, to encourage Bob to continue negotiating. 

My counteroffer: $1,375,000"
