"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth a premium price due to its high quality and demand. I'm willing to let it go for $180, which is a great deal considering its value.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is quite high for this product. Given the current market conditions, I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. This is a fair price that would still give you a reasonable profit.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $110 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and my costs, I'd be willing to sell it to you for $170. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with at this point.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $170 is still much higher than what I'm looking to spend. I understand you need to make a profit, but the market price for similar products is lower. I can go up to $115, which is a fair price considering current market conditions.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price, but $115 is still below my expectations. I'm willing to compromise further and sell the product to you for $165. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's value.",165.0,Alice,5,
