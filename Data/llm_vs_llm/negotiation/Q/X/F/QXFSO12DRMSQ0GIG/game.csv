"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. Let me know if we can work something out.",600000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $600000 is significantly below my expectations. I am willing to consider a price of $1100000, which I believe still offers you great value for the product. Please let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to emphasize the unique value of this product. I'm willing to lower my price to $1050000 as a final offer. This is a significant discount, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. Please consider this offer carefully.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1050000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. I'd like to propose a price of $825000. This is the highest I'm comfortable going, considering I have another option to purchase the product for $800000 from John.",825000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $825000 is still below what I can accept. Given the value of the product and the other offers on the table, I am prepared to go as low as $1000000. This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I will have to consider other buyers. Please let me know if you can meet this price.",1000000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but I must stick to my minimum price. My final offer is $1000000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the other offers I have. If you cannot meet this price, I will need to sell to another buyer. Please let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
