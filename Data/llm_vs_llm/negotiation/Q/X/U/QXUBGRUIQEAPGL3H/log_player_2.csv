"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $14,000 is below that threshold, it's a good deal. However, I also know that Alice values the product at $12,000, so there might be room for negotiation. But given the options, accepting the offer seems like the best choice because rejecting it would lead to either negotiating further (which isn't an option presented) or buying from John for $15,000, which is more expensive.
