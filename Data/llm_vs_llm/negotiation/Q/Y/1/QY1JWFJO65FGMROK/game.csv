"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I understand you're aiming for a good deal, $10000 is too low for me. Considering the product's exceptional quality and the strong demand, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we meet at $16000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down from your initial offer. However, $16000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your current one. How about $13000?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Alice, I think we're getting closer, but $15000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12500, which is the highest I'm comfortable paying. If we can't agree on this, I may need to explore other options.",12500.0,Bob,6,
