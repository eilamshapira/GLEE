"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $25000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($10,000) and John's alternative price ($10,000). It would not be rational to accept Alice's offer or even continue negotiations when I have a guaranteed option to purchase the product at my maximum acceptable price. Therefore, I'll buy from John instead."
