"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. Since you have other options and you're aiming to save as much as possible, rejecting and making a counteroffer makes more sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $100. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and leaves room for negotiation. It's a fair starting point, considering my goal is to save as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still a bit high, but it's getting closer to what I'm aiming for.  I'll reject her offer and try to get it down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm raising my offer to $110. This is still significantly less than Alice's last offer and hopefully, she'll see it as a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $125 is within my budget and a good deal considering it's still lower than what John is offering. I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal."
