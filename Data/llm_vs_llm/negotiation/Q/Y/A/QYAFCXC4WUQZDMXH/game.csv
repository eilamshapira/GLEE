"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. Your willingness to negotiate shows we can find a middle ground. While $900000 is better than your initial offer, I believe $725000 would be a more balanced price point that considers both our positions. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and would allow us to close this deal quickly.",725000.0,Bob,4,
