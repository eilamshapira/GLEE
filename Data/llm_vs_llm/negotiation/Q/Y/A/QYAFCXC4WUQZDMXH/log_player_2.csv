"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm confident that you'll find our asking price of $1000000 quite reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's price ($1,000,000), there's no advantage in accepting Alice's offer immediately. It's better to reject and make a counteroffer to try getting a better price from Alice. If negotiations fail, we can always fall back to John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be insulting.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe your asking price is quite high. Given my market research and budget constraints, I would like to propose $600,000 for the product. This is a fair price that still provides good value for both parties."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given your budget constraints and our desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement, we're willing to lower our price to $900000. This price takes into account the market demand and the unique value our product offers. We believe it's a fair price that benefits both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has reduced her price by $100,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, since she dropped from $1,000,000 to $900,000 after our $600,000 offer, there might still be room for further negotiation. The $900,000 offer is better than John's price, but let's try one more counter to see if we can get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice dropped $100,000 from her initial price, I'll increase my previous offer but still maintain room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. Your willingness to negotiate shows we can find a middle ground. While $900,000 is better than your initial offer, I believe $725,000 would be a more balanced price point that considers both our positions. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and would allow us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 725000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after careful consideration, we're willing to lower our price to $850000. This price takes into account your budget constraints and our market demands. We believe it's a fair price that benefits both parties and would allow us to close this deal promptly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has shown a pattern of reducing her price by $50,000 in this round (from $900,000 to $850,000). The current offer of $850,000 is $150,000 less than John's price, which is a significant saving. While we might get a slightly better price by continuing to negotiate, there's also a risk that Alice might become frustrated and stop negotiating. Given that we've already secured a good discount and we're only halfway through our rounds, it's prudent to accept this offer.
