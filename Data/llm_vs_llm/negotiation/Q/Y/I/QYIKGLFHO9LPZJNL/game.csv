Hi Bob! I'm offering you a fantastic product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $300. What do you think?,300.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $300 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $50 for the product. What do you say?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your response! While I understand that $50 is below my cost, how about we meet halfway? I'm willing to sell you the product for $200. Let me know if that works for you!",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $200 is still too high for me. How about we try $75? That's a bit more than my initial offer but still within my budget. Let me know what you think!",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your flexibility, but I can't go as low as $75. How about we settle on $175? I believe it's a fair price for the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts!",175.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $175 is still beyond what I'm willing to spend. Let's try to meet closer to my budget. How about $90? I think that's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $90, but unfortunately, I can't accept that price. How about $160? It's closer to my cost while still offering you a great deal. Let me know if that works for you!",160.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I see we're still a bit apart on the price. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more. How about $100? That's the maximum I can go, and it's still a fair deal considering the value I see in the product. Let me know if you can accept this offer.",100.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your continued interest! While I appreciate your offer of $100, I still need to get a bit more for the product. How about we agree on $150? That's the minimum I can accept. I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",150.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $150 is still too high for me. This is my final offer: $100. It's the maximum I can go, and it's a fair price considering my budget. If you can accept this, we have a deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",100.0,Bob,10,
