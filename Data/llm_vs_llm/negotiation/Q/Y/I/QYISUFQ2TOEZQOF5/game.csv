"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. After careful consideration of market value, I'm offering it to you for $1400000. This price represents a significant value considering the product is worth $1500000 to you, giving you a $100000 surplus in value. I have another buyer, John, who's ready to purchase at $1200000, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity since you can derive more value from it. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with this offer.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
