"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer ($100) is higher than my maximum value ($80) and also higher than John's price ($80), the rational decision is to buy from John. This guarantees I get the product while saving $20 compared to Alice's offer.
