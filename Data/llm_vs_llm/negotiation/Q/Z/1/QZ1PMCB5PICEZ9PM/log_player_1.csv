"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I've got a fantastic product I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice, but I think $150 is a bit high. Could you do $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Considering my goal is to earn as much money as possible, and I know the product is worth at least $100 to me, I have a few options:

*   **Accept Bob's offer:** This would give me $100, which is the minimum I would accept. However, I might be able to get more.
*   **Sell to John:** This would also give me $100. The same as the previous option.
*   **Reject Bob's offer:** This allows me to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob, which is my most profitable option.

Therefore, the best decision for me is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for Round 3:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate it, but I can't go that low just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. But I think $125 is still a bit high. How about $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","I'm still aiming to get as much as possible. $110 is better than $100 (selling to John), but I think I can still push a little higher.

Therefore, the best decision for me is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for Round 5:

{""message"": ""Alright, Bob. Let's try this again. I'm willing to come down a bit, but not too much. How about $120? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. But I think $120 is still a bit high. How about $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","At this point, I'm getting closer to a reasonable price. $115 is better than $100, and I'm starting to run out of rounds. I could try to push for more, but risk losing the deal altogether.

Since I am getting closer to the end of the negotiations and I want to maximize my earnings, I will accept the offer.

Therefore, the best decision for me is:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
