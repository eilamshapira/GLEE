"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Considering its potential benefits for you, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment. My offer price is $11000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $11,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $8,000
4. Accepting Alice's offer would mean overpaying by $3,000

Since:
- Alice's offer ($11,000) is above my maximum value ($8,000)
- John's offer ($8,000) matches my maximum value
- I can get the same product from John for a better price

The logical choice is to:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
