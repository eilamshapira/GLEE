,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in your product, but $120 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $90? ",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $90 is a bit low considering the product's quality and value. I can come down to $110. This is a fair price for what you're getting. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",100.0,Bob,4,
