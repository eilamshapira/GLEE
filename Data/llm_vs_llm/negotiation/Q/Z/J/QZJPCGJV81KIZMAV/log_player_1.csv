Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price to offer Bob.

Bob values the product at $1,500,000, and I have a guaranteed backup offer of $1,000,000 from John. If I offer Bob a price too close to $1,500,000, he might reject it since he wouldn't gain much value. However, I want to maximize my profit while still giving Bob enough incentive to accept.

I'll offer a price that gives Bob a reasonable surplus while significantly improving my position compared to John's offer. A price of $1,300,000 would give Bob a $200,000 surplus while giving me $300,000 more than John's offer.
