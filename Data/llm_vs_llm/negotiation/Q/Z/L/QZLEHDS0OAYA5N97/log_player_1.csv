Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering to sell you this great product! It's a real deal. How about we start at $115?"", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $115 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Okay, considering Bob's counteroffer of $90, and that I value the product at $100 and John is offering $100, I will reject Bob's offer.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. However, I can't go down to $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  Could we do $95?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","This is a tough spot. Bob is still below what I'd ideally like, but it's closer. John's offer of $100 is also tempting. I need to weigh my options carefully. I value the product at no less than $100, and Bob's current offer is below that. However, Bob values the product more than I do. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate one more time.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks again for the offer. I am trying to get as much value as I can for the product. If you could come up to $102, I'm happy to close the deal. It's a great product, and I think you'll really enjoy it!"", ""product_price"": 102}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","This is a difficult decision. Bob is offering $98.50. I have to make a choice between $98.50 and $100 from John. While I'd *prefer* more than $100, I also don't know what Bob's final offer would be.

I will accept John's offer.
